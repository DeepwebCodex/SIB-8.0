9 2008-08-15 INVESTIGATIVE WORK FOR ZOOCHECK CANADA I've just finished three weeks of photo investigative work across Southern Ontario for Zoocheck Canada. Rob Laidlaw, the founder of Zoocheck, describes the beings I photograph as the living dead.  This is really hard for me to reconcile while I'm working, as I take their photographs and turn away.  My hope is that these photographs, these disclosures which will be used by Zoocheck and w/in the <i>We Animals</i> documentary, will help to raise awareness about  the plight of animals in needless captivity.  The photos will help future generations of animals, but not those behind bars now.  All in all, it's really depressing and frustrating work.

6 2008-08-29 GRANT FROM THE CULTURE AND ANIMALS FOUNDATION I would really like to thank Tom and Nancy Regan of the Culture and Animals Foundation for their generous grant in support of the "We Animals" project.  This year, the grant has helped cover part of my travel costs as well as the construction of this website.  The Culture and Animals Foundation is a nonprofit, cultural organization committed to fostering the growth of intellectual and artistic endeavors united by a positive concern for animals.

11 2008-10-28 Penguin Exhibit at the Montreal Biodome The Montreal Biodome boasts a world-class exhibit of animals from around the world.  The building is impressive with its towering glass ceilings and five different temperature-controlled ecosystems.  Like most zoos, though, the building is impressive and the space left for the animals is pathetically small.  A capybara lives alone on a small patch of dirt with a tiny pond nearby in the Tropical Forest Ecosystem exhibit.  The area is full of greenery and does well imitating a tropical environment, but it doesn't change the fact that the animal will live out its entire life in a mind-numbingly small environment.  The much acclaimed Antarctic penguin facility is their most popular exhibit and also their best example of substandard conditions for animals in captivity.  Their web site boasts a landscape that "...evokes the shore of a volcanic island lying between the Antarctic peninsula and the tip of South America. Basalt is the main rock formation."  They've reproduced a likeness to the penguin's native land, but only a tiny patch of it. King and Emperor penguins, for example, live in colonies of over 25,000 birds and they are known to travel hundreds of kilometers every year. The Biodome penguins have perhaps 50 meters of ground to spend their lives on (and the average life spand of a Penguin is 15 - 20 years). The Biodome is also proud of their "success in achieving reproduction in captivity", which will ensure decades of penquins in captivity for our viewing pleasure. biodome penguins for weanimals.jpg
10 2008-08-22 SEA TURTLES IN FLORIDA AND CUBA In June I had the opportunity to photograph at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida.  The LMC is one of a few sea turtle hospitals permitted by the state to treat threatened and endangered sea turtles such as the Loggerhead, Green, Leatherback, Kemp's Ridley and Hawksbill.  The LMC acts as an educational center as well: the public can visit, watch medical procedures and learn about protecting these beautiful creatures and their ecosystem.  Their work is labourious: volunteer veterinarians and staff work around the clock to provide care for injured turtles so that each patient can eventually be released back into the ocean.
The Florida facility was in stark contrast to the Aquarium in Havana, Cuba, where I photographed last week.  I was really distressed to see dozens upon dozens of sea turtles kept in small aquariums for the tourists' viewing pleasure.  Many were packed into pools within 20 meters of the ocean and I don't doubt that they could hear and smell their rightful home.

12 2008-11-10 Upcoming shoots for <i> We Animals </i>: Japan, Solomon Islands, Cameroon I guess this is my first official plea for help.

I have some wonderful opportunities to work on <i>We Animals</i> this winter. I hope to get to Japan within a few weeks to document the dolphin massacres and work alongside the amazing Ric O'Barry (www.savethedolphins.org). Following that, a visit to the South Pacific to photograph the "swim with dolphins" tourist industry. I'm also very excited to be working with the Cameroon Wildlife Aid Fund (www.cwaf.org) throughout February and March '09. I'll be working with rescued chimpanzees, gorillas, baboons and monkeys, as well as documenting the incredibly hard work of Rachel Hogan and her staff.

At the very least, I will be working on <i>We Animals</i> for three months this winter. Flight costs are my main concern, so I am appealing to those of you who have air miles and are willing to donate some of them for the sake of this documentary project. Points can be shared through Aeroplan, and any number of points are welcomed and hugely appreciated. 100 points or 10,000 points, it all helps and it all adds up.

The response to <i>We Animals</i> has been amazing so far and I thank those of you who have written to me and challenged me. Your support fuels the fire, reminds me that the photographs are changing hearts and minds, and pushes me to continue documenting the shocking abuses that animals face at the hands of humans.

If you are interested in supporting the project by donating miles through Aeroplan, please contact me at jo@joannemcarthur.com
14 2009-01-07 The Horse. El Estor, Guatemala. She didn't move the entire time.  Old, too skinny, eyes half closed, seemingly meditative. I watched her as she stood knee deep in Lago de Izabal, taking part in the sunset, taking part in her thoughts, and ignoring the younger horse that paced, anxiously awaiting her from shore. 

I wish I could have known her thoughts. horse blog photo.jpg
15 2009-01-29 Cameroon, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania I will be working on <i>We Animals</i> in Africa until mid-April.  The Cameroon Wildlife Aid Fund (www.cwaf.org) has an incredible primate sanctuary where I'll be volunteering.  From there, I'll head into Uganda, hopefully to document the amazing work at Ngamba Island Sanctuary, as well as aspects of the illegal bush meat and primate trade.
Thank you for all of your emails in support of my work and the project. It fuels the fire!
Check back in late April for new photos and stories.
16 2009-02-22 Rachel's Promise.  Cameroon (www.cwaf.org) I'm thrilled to be working on a story about the fulfillment of Rachel Hogan's promise to Nkan Daniel and Shai, the rescued gorillas she raised when she first came to the Cameroon Wildlife Aid Fund eight years ago.  <b>May 6th update:</b> Look for the full story in the September issue of ELLE Magazine (Canadian Edition), as well as images from Ape Action Africa (formerly CWAF) throughout the <i>We Animals</i> portfolio. rachel w shai for blog.JPG
17 2009-03-26 Former Hunters w/ Snares. Budongo Forest, Uganda A significant part of Uganda's endangered chimpanzee population lives in Budongo Forest where poaching is common. Because most Ugandans do not eat primates, the poaching is mainly targeted toward wild pigs, duikers and other ungulates. However, as many as 25% of the area's chimpanzees have snare-related injuries, and hundreds of additional animals are killed each year. The Jane Goodall Institute and its partners such as Budongo Conservation Field Station have implemented a program that hires former hunters from surrounding villages to go out into the forest and remove these traps moses and ofen for blog.jpg
18 2009-04-22 2009 Grant, Culture and Animals Foundation I would really like to thank the Culture and Animals Foundation for their continuing support of the <i>We Animals</i> project.  Their 2009 grant will help with the costs of air and land travel, web updates and book design.

115 2011-02-08 Toronto Pig Save <p>There's an amazing new initiative happening in Toronto.</p>
<p>The Toronto Pig Save website, http://torontopigsave.wordpress.com/, has started by looking at Toronto's Quality Meat Packing plant, raising awareness about what is happening with animals in our own city.</p>
<p>It's a fantastic resource, full of information, artwork, stories about animals and about people working to help them. The site continues to gain momentum as it joins forces with artists, writers, activists and sanctuary owners, so check back often.</p>
<p>Speaking of Toronto...want to send some love to the fur-bearing animals this Valentine's day? Come join Ark-II's anti-fur demo outside of Holt Renfrew in Toronto this Saturday, February 12th.  We'll be there from 1 to 2pm. Let's make our presence known and our compassion heard!</p> FF SP3_0228.jpg Toronto Pig Save,pigs,slaughter,transport,vigil,demonstration,vegan

117 2011-02-08 Breaking Down the Walls That Separate "Friend" from "Food" <p>From the dailymail.co.uk, "The Pig That's Top Dog: Pot-bellied Porker Outshines Canines in Agility Team":  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1352874/Louie-pig-thinks-hes-dog-earns-place-CANINE-display-team.html</p>
<p>This article is interesting, not because it's a cute story about a pig who can do tricks, but because it illustrates that pigs are as smart as, if not smarter than the animals we chose as companion animals.  This is old news, but not mainstream news.</p>
<p>My hope with this article is that readers look beyond the cute factor and understand that there is no difference between the pig, traditionally seen as food, and the companion animals we treasure, love and protect.    If both are highly intelligent animals who can feel, respond and play, why then differentiate the two? Relegating one to factory farms, fear and slaughter, and the other to our homes and our protection?</p>

118 2011-02-14 No Mercy Here <p>Poetry is quite a departure from what I normally post here.  This was written a few nights ago (and reformatted into paragraphs due to space constraints here), for the hundreds of thousands of animals I have met in factory farms and slaughterhouses.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No Mercy Here</span></p>
<p>I am captive, but I hope for freedom. I am a slave, waiting for mercy. I do not believe my life will be cut short.</p>
<p>My will to live, to protect my precious self, is fierce. My life is all I have. I have hope for life, my own life.  And I have fear. I see no mercy here.</p>
<p>I was taken from my mother when I was born. I was clipped, tattooed, tagged, mutilated. I have been shackled, confined, impregnated, enslaved. I have not made friends here. I have no nest here. I have pain and wounds. There is no peaceful slumber.  I am crowded, there is no room to stretch. I am moved from cage to cage. I do not understand. But I hope.</p>
<p>There are many of us here. Thousands. On the day the men come to move us we are screaming and shitting with fear. We are beaten to our feet. We look for a way out. We look beyond the walls and into the eyes of men but there is no way, and no mercy. Still, we hope.</p>
<p>Some of us die of exposure, others from broken limbs. I am corralled over the bodies of the others and into paths of walls and darkness full of screaming. We haven't had water in days. We are crazed with fear. We are crazed with longing for escape.</p>
<p>I know what this smell is. Now I see why those in front of me are screaming or struck dumb.   My life is precious. I know there is freedom close by. I know that, somewhere, there is mercy among these men who take our lives for reasons I will never know.</p>
<p>I am hung by my foot. My head hits the red concrete. My hip dislocates. I struggle with my whole being to save my life. Is it possible that my life will not be saved? My life is precious. I have hope for mercy. I am searching, screaming for mercy.</p> WeAnimals_pigsave_2 (56).jpg mercy,factory farm,poetry,sheep,goat,slaughter

128 2011-03-29 Not Your Typical Seaworld Photo... <p>...but this is the kind of thing I would like to see more of, at Aquariums.</p>
<p>Human underwater acts, where the entertainment is provided by those who chose to be there! It was the best part (truly, the one and only good part) of being at Seaworld in Orlando, Florida, this week.  The rest of the day consisted of shows that we have unfortunately come to expect from places like Seaworld. Though they boast conservation efforts (their 27th killer whale was born there last October), the animals remain in captivity and are used for our entertainment and for profit.</p>
<p>Other shows and exhibits include the use of sea lions and crowded, shallow touch tanks for the sting rays. Many of the animals on display, such as those mentioned above along with some birds, have become beggars for the fish that tourists purchase to throw to them. Sting rays try to climb the walls of the tank to get at food and sea lions spend their day sitting on rocks, waving and barking at people for treats. It's a crime against all of their natural instincts, not to mention for the fish as well, who are killed so that tourists can feed them to animals.</p>
<p>We're too involved, we're controlling too much. Leave the sea lions and rays to their natural habitats. Let them kill the fish they need to survive. In the mean time, get the animals out of this tourist industry where they are made to beg and perform, and into a sanctuary where their needs are put first and they are not used for profit. Seaworld says that many of their animals are rescued. This is great, but why make slaves out of them in the process?</p>
<p>You can contact Seaworld here: http://www.seaworld.com/contactus.aspx</p>

126 2011-03-22 This is Not a Story About Africa <p>It's not often that someone with a camera can gain access to a slaughterhouse. In some countries, though, the slaughter happens outdoors for all to see. I photographed at such a place two weeks ago, in Tanzania.</p>
<p>Over the course of two mornings I was able to speak with the workers (those who could speak English), and document the killing of goats and cows. One of the workers' comments really resonated with me. He asked me not to take photos because I would go back to Canada and show people what a dirty and bad place Africa is. This saddened me on so many levels. We spoke at length about why I was taking photos, that I am not used to being able to see this process, that it happens very much behind closed doors in North America. I explained that I wanted to take photos so that people could know where their food comes from and how the animals are killed.</p>
<p>At that point, he encouraged me to take photos. He too thought it was awful that we killed animals for food. It was not a job he wanted to do; the slaughterhouse work is dangerous and garnered less than two dollars a day. I promised him I had no intention of exploiting his country or the continent, but that I wanted to show that animals go through brutal lives and horrible deaths all over the globe.</p>
<p>This is one photograph from the series on slaughter.</p>

127 2011-03-22 We Animals Work in Florida <p>A quick update from Florida, where I'm taking photos of the alligator industry (tourism, trinkets, meat) and then heading to Dr. Carole Noon's amazing "Save the Chimps" sanctuary near Fort Pierce.</p>
<p>There is another chimp migration happening; more primates are being moved from their former home in New Mexico to the sanctuary in Florida, and I get to take photos of this amazing event.  Also want to thank everyone who has financially supported the We Animals project. I have to move around a lot on this trip, visit many different places, and I wouldn't be able to do it without a car rental. There are of course accommodation costs as well, though many people do take me in, which is amazing! Your donations help me cover costs such as these and I can't thank you enough.</p>

125 2011-03-19 The Great Meatout Begins! <p>Tomorrow, March 20th, is the great Meatout. What the heck is that? It's the world's largest grassroots diet education campaign, launched by FARM USA (www.farmusa.org), who aim to expose thousands of people, in dozens of countries, to a veg*n diet.</p>
<p>FARM USA wants people to "get active to host educational events for Meatout. Activists can distribute free food, educate their communities, and ask their friends, families, and neighbors to "kick the meat habit&rdquo; and explore a wholesome, compassionate diet of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains."</p>
<p>Consider excluding animal products from your diet on March 20th (or around that date) and asking others to do the same as well! You can also organize an event, be it a potluck, a visit to an animal sanctuary, taking part in leafleting; anything to reach the masses about a more compassionate diet.  For more information and ideas, visit www.meatout.org</p>
<p>Have fun!</p> 2-jayne 133.jpg meat out,vegan,vegetarian,FARM USA

91 This is one of my favourite photos from the We Animals book, from my favourite chapter, called "Mercy". This chapter&nbsp; highlights some of the amazing work being done around the world to help animals. In this photograph, Australia activists from the phenomenal group Animal Liberation Victoria have just finished an open rescue. The photo is backlit by the moon and in the arms of these activists are sick piglets who were marked for death. You can just make out the silhouette of one of them in arms of ALV's president, Noah Hannibal. 
 
 Thanks to everyone who continues to pre-order the We Animals book. It's exciting to see so much anticipation for its arrival. It can be pre-ordered here: <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

1 <ul>
<li>Lead by example, live compassionately.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reduce and eliminate your consumption of animals.&nbsp; With all the amazing and healthy alternatives to meat, there's really no excuse!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Volunteer at your local animal shelter or sanctuary.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Organize a fundraiser for your favourite animal charity.&nbsp; If you don't have a favourite, pick one from the many I have listed in the "links" page www.weanimals.org/links.php.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Help legislate change. Write to and speak with your local representatives.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Visit your neighbours and collect badly needed supplies for your local shelter or sanctuary.&nbsp; People can donate animal food, old towels and blankets, toys, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Foster a homeless animal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Spay and neuter your companion animals!&nbsp; This will help reduce the number of unwanted and homeless animals around the globe.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Carry a "compassion kit" in your car in case you need to help transport an animal to a shelter in a hurry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Drive less!&nbsp; We're all polluting the environment and jeopardizing animal habitats with our driving habits!&nbsp;&nbsp; Help stop climate change by choosing a bicycle or public transit as your mode of transportation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don't attend circuses, rodeos and fairs that use animals for entertainment.&nbsp; Speak up against such blatant and unnecessary forms of cruelty. Animals are not ours for entertainment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Look for the cruelty free label. Buy products that have not been tested on animals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Speak up.&nbsp; If you see a situation of cruelty or abuse, talk to the perpetrator, or call the authorities.&nbsp; We so often assume someone else will deal with the problem.&nbsp; If we don't speak up, who will?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We are responsible for the animals we bring into our lives.&nbsp; Don't buy or adopt animals on a whim, or as gifts.&nbsp; These are the animals who so often get returned, sent to a shelter or euthanized.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don't wear animal products. It&rsquo;s unnecessary, and sends a message that you support animal exploitation for clothing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sport clothes w/ an animal-friendly message, stick a bumper sticker on your car, carry literature on you that promote compassion towards animals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Object to animal dissection in your science class and in your science degree.&nbsp; There are alternatives, which you can bring to your class room and promote. www.interniche.org</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Leave literature and leaflets about compassion towards animals at your local laundromat, dentist and doctor&rsquo;s office.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Host a vegan party or potluck.&nbsp; Let people know how delicious vegan food is!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Support your local veg*an restaurants. Bring your family!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Report animal cruelty or suspected cruelty to your local SPCA or Animal Services.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Community and school outreach.&nbsp; Give a talk, or sponsor a speaker to come and talk about animal cruelty and compassion towards animals at your town or city's university, college, schools, libraries and community centers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bring Humane Educators to your school.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Vote with your dollar.&nbsp; When you spend money that supports cruelty to animals, you perpetuate animal cruelty.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Host animal documentary movie nights, either at your home or at a local school, library or cinema.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Organize or attend a public protest against animal cruelty.&nbsp; Engage the public.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Donate to organizations that don&rsquo;t use animals in research.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don't bow to pressure.&nbsp; Whether it's your Italian grandma who's heart you'll break if you don't eat the sausages she made <em>just for you</em>, your redneck boyfriend who wants you to go cow tipping or the magazine that tells you you're ugly if you don't buy their animal tested product, stick to your convictions.&nbsp; You'll respect yourself more for it. In the end, everyone else will, too.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sign a petition.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Keep the phone number of your local animal rescues on hand in case you see a case of neglect, cruelty, or come across an injured animal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ask your school cafeteria to offer more veggie and vegan options.|</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lights off!&nbsp; Ask office buildings to turn their lights off at night which will help reduce the high number of birds killed every year who fly into windows. At home, paste black-silhouetted bird shapes to your window which will alert birds to danger and make them swerve away from the window.&nbsp; In order for this to work, you must paste many of these.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>While travelling, don&rsquo;t buy endangered animal products such as ivory or other body parts. Don't eat the meat of endangered animals, such as gorillas and chimpanzees in Africa.&nbsp; Further to that, let the vendors know that you don't approve!</li>
</ul>

44 Companions Though humans use most animals for food, clothing, work and entertainment, there are a select few, the chosen ones, enlisted and bred to be our companions.  Many of us have been fortunate enough to share our lives with these intelligent and emotive creatures; they become part of our families.  They are cherished in life and mourned in death, much like our human loved ones.  

It is these relationships that teach us that animals are indeed sentient beings, that they can play and love as we can.  

My hope is that we humans will eventually expand our circles of compassion to include all animals, all sentient beings, not just those we invite into our homes. Some of these photos show that we can indeed share space, love and friendships with those we use for food. B ospca 358.jpg
34 Discarded Property Under most international laws, animals are regarded as human property and not seen as their own entities, worthy of rights and protection.  Such property is purchased and used for whatever means to an end that it is designated to provide: cows for milking, veal for its tender meat, sheep for wool, "pets" for companionship and entertainment, fish to look nice in aquariums, "starter pets" such as rabbits and hamsters for kids to play with, look after and eventually neglect.
These photographs represent our discarded property: animals with no rights of their own, little protection from the law, and who have outlived their usefulness to humans. A 8-santiagodog.jpg
33 Food Animals The numbers are staggering; impossible to understand or feel.  An estimated ten billion food animals such as cows, goats, chickens and pigs are killed every year in North America alone.  This number doesn't even include fish and other marine life.  Animals once raised on family farms are now mass produced in factory farms where they live out short lives in confinement, deprived of sunlight, proper food and even the ability to turn around.  
I could elaborate on the facts but my job is to document and let the photographs speak for themselves.  These are the faces of the meat industry. foodanimals.jpg
27 For Our Amusement Elephants are broken and forced to perform at circuses. Tigers are taught to jump through burning hoops for cheering audiences.  Bears are taught to dance in India.  Yaks are forced to endure tourists on their backs in the Himalayas.  Exotic animals live banal existences behind bars for our viewing pleasure. Deer are killed and stuffed so that we may hang their heads on our walls.  Fish are kept alone in bowls so that we might glance at them as we walk through our living rooms.  Every human act in support of animal slavery and confinement perpetuates the belief that they exist for our amusement. E DSC_0262.jpg
32 Research and Vivisection "Ask the experimenters why they experiment on animals, and the answer is: 'Because the animals are like us.' Ask the experimenters why it is morally OK to experiment on animals, and the answer is: 'Because the animals are not like us.' Animal experimentation rests on a logical contradiction."
-Professor Charles R. Magel 01280001.jpg
29 Bear Bile Farming and Sanctuary In Asia, tens of thousands of bears are kept in tiny cages their entire lives so that their gall bladders can be tapped for bile and then used in certain Chinese medicines.  Most of these bears live out their lives, anywhere 5 to 30 years, at bear bile farms, barely able to turn around in their confined spaces.  Many of these beautiful Asiatic black bears also have their paws severed for "bear paw soup" or have lost limbs in the wild from being wild trapped. At these farms, they exist in a state of living death. 

In the past few decades, NGOs have been taking up the cause of these bears, providing education to the public as well as sanctuary for these abused animals.  Spearheading the movement to end bear bile farming are the Animals Asia Foundation, as well as Free the Bears.  They work tirelessly to educate people about the abuse inflicted on the bears and about cruelty-free alternatives to this product. Bear bile can be and is reproduced synthetically, but bear bile has been used in Chinese medicine for over 3000 years and traditionalists are slow to change their ways.  

The following photos were taken at a bear bile farm and at bear sanctuaries in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.

30 Good Intentions This section of "We Animals" pertains more so to the issue of "good intentions gone wrong" than to the successful rescue efforts of many sanctuaries. My best examples are the Home for Crippled Dogs in Bangkok and the SPCA in Calcutta.  Run by strict Buddhists and Hindus, they believe that euthanasia is not God's way.  I was told that Westerners like myself do not truly love or care for animals because we euthanize them. At the SPCA, I pointed out a dog that was crippled and rotting alive with a flesh-eating disease.  This dog belonged to no one and would live out its days in suffering until its body quit of its own accord. In Bangkok, their holy work involved keeping hundreds of crippled, sick and unwanted dogs alive, only to live out their days in tiny cribs. The Bangkok facility barely had enough resources to give each dog a blanket to lie on. I honour the staff's intentions but question their actions in the face of such intense day to day suffering.
Religion aside, I also question the motives of many animal "rescuers". Elephants are removed from hard labour in the Thai logging industry only to be reenslaved as tourist entertainers and as income for its owner.  Tigers are rescued from euthanasia after years of service to a circus, only to be put in a too-small cage for another twenty years. Foreign animals are born in captivity and brought to schools so that children can have the opportunity to see and touch them. It would be easier if we all spoke a common language and they could voice their choices. A CD2_0647.jpg
35 Portraits I meet so many beautiful faces while working on "We Animals".  Here are a select few.

Thanks to all the wonderful organizations featured in these photographs - it's a joy to document the beautiful individuals you've rescued. portraits.jpg
36 Rescues Mercifully, there are thousands of animal rescue groups and millions of people around the globe dedicated to helping animals.  

You'll find here a few images from rescues in action and of the rescued animals themselves. Many more photos to come!

There is also a list of wonderful local and international rescue groups in the "links and resources" section of the We Animals site. Please check them out and lend them a hand! OB2_0293cr.jpg
37 Rodeos There are few events as blatantly cruel as rodeos.  I am amazed and ashamed that millions of people still attend these events each year in Canada and the Unites States.  Horses are routinely injured and killed in chuck wagon racing. Bulls and horses are beaten, choked and maimed.  The calf roping is the most horrific event of all: men exercise their juvenile brutality by roping and tackling calves, some as young as eight weeks old. Out of view of the spectators, electric prods are used on all the animals.
All of this occurs under the guise of preserving North American culture; in fact, cowboy culture was a blip in time, glamourized by Hollywood movies. Do not be fooled, this is nothing but romanticized cruelty to animals for the sole purpose of profit and entertainment. 
Reconsider visiting any rodeos, and better yet, speak up against them.
These photos were taken across Canada between 2002 and 2010. F DSC_0205.jpg

11 2010-11-10 The Rhythm This is a film about rabbits, but it is also not a film about rabbits; really, this is a film about the cold, mechanical rationale of the kill line. though it might be tempting to focus on the particular species of animal being killed, or to look for the face of the one doing the killing, try to keep in mind: it doesn't matter whether the animals are cute or not, or who does the cutting.

and no matter what music plays in the slaughterhouse, the rhythm is always the same.

25 2016-11-09 Family Dairy The following was taken at a small dairy farm just outside Barcelona, Spain. We Animals teamed up with Igualdad Animal (Animal Equality) to launch an investigation into what are widely considered the most humane practices in farming dairy cows. The footage you see here was taken over the course of a single day. Animal rights activist and lawyer and mother of two, Anna Pippus, tells us their story.

26 2017-08-01 Undercover: Stories from a Former Investigator Narrated by former undercover investigator Geoff Regier, we are invited into his world of work at chicken slaughterhouses, to hear his personal account of what it's like to take part in the kill line as an outlier over the course of weeks and, eventually, years. 

Footage is from filmmaker and We Animals team member Kelly Guerin, who was granted rare full access to film in a chicken slaughterhouse. Guerin's forensic lens reveals the stark, mechanized workings of the slaughterhouse, and offers an unflinching and intimate look at the birds caught in this system. https://vimeo.com/219891801 Screen Shot 2017-08-01 at 10.56.32 AM.png 1
27 2017-08-01 Activism in Australia In March of this year, Jo-Anne spent three weeks documenting the work of animal rights activists in Australia. From sanctuaries to slaughterhouses, what she saw was a movement thriving, driven by tireless compassion and dedication to making the world a kinder place. Take a few minutes to meet some of the people taking part and speaking up, and watch the inspiring progress happening for animals in Australia! https://vimeo.com/222227028 Screen Shot 2017-08-01 at 10.58.23 AM.png 0
13 2010-12-06 Open Rescue: Hens RELEASE FROM IGUALDAD ANIMAL | igualdadanimal.org

Animal Equality activists have rescued five hens from a farm containing 160,000 animals on Monday 16 September.

After entering one of the sheds via an unlocked door and without having to use any type of force, the activists removed five hens, who were later examined by a vet. One of them had to be operated on to remove a huge mass from her head resulting from an old eye infection. Another hen is currently receiving veterinary treatment but is out of danger.

These animals were being subjected to a process called a forced molt, in which through severe food restriction - including going for days without eating - and in total darkness, their bodies are shocked into a new cycle of egg-laying.

These one-and-a-half-year-old animals have spent the last eleven months trapped behind bars without being able to see the sun. They are suffering from various nutritional deficiencies and some of them also have liver damage due to the high protein content of their food which is given in order to increase the weight of their eggs.

The Animal Equality Open Rescue Team has recorded these images because we believe it is essential that society has access to what happens inside places like these so they have the ability to think about how the animals must feel.

This rescue was carried out on a farm with battery cages similar to the 'enriched cages' which will obligatory from 2012 onwards throughout the European Union. Nevertheless, on 'free-range' farms, hens are still deprived of their freedom and used as mere resources for human benefit, and finally all of them are sent to the slaughterhouse at a fraction of their natural lifespan.

In Spain, more than 47 million hens are victims of this system which exists to satisfy the demand for eggs. Eggs that we do not even need. In the UK the figure is 32 million. The same number of male chicks - their brothers - are also victims of this consumption. Often forgotten they do not even register in official statistics. On every type of farm, male chicks are killed, either ground up alive or gassed, because they do not lay eggs and they are not profitable for any other purpose.

Animal Equality rescues animals not only to help these particular individuals, but also to get society to reflect and stop seeing the other animals with which we share the planet as being at our disposal, as resources we can make a profit from. 

As in all open rescues we carry out, we always come away filled with a sensation of sadness and impotence when we have to close the door and leave behind the thousands of other animals who will suffer their whole lives only to end up with their throats slit in a slaughterhouse.

We are simply unable to rescue all the animals on farms, in slaughterhouses, or laboratories. Ending this ongoing animal holocaust depends on each one of us, it depends on removing our financial support from all of it, in all its forms.

Living as vegans means we free those animals who were going to be forced to suffer and die for our demands, and builds a base of support for a world that is more equal for all, regardless of the species we belong to.

Towards the abolition of animal slavery.
