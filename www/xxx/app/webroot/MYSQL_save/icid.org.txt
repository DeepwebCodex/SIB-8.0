Of the total area some 4 to 5 million km2 comprise arid and semi arid land. 33 per 
cent of the total area is still public land. A third of this public land consists of various kinds of Crown land, with few exceptions, is useless for crops or livestock because of aridity or ruggedness. About 63 per cent of the total area is devoted to farms and pastoral activities. Crop lands are about 150,000 km2 and permanent or rotational pastorals account for about 252,000 km2. Area irrigated for crops is about 5 per cent of the cropped land, i.e. 740,000 ha; there are also about 764,500 ha of irrigated pastures.</font></p><p> </p><p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background Information </font></strong></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While irrigation applies only to 0.4 per cent of Australia~s agricultural land, it accounts for $A7.3 billion — or 25 per cent — of Australia~s gross value of agricultural production. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It supports significant value-added industries based on producing rice, dairy products, wine, fruit, vegetables, sugar and cotton — much of which are exported. It provides jobs and wealth for Australia~s rural communities. And it uses more than $A9 billion of water industry assets.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While Australia accounts for 0.3% of the world~s population it accounts for around 1% of global water resources. This would seem to make Australia relatively water-rich, 
and indeed, much of water is used for irrigation that goes into products  that are exported. However, Australia accounts for around 5% of the world~s landmass, and on this basis, is a relatively dry continent compared to the rest of the world – only Antarctica is drier. It also experiences extreme variability in both rainfall and streamflow across the continent and from season to season. This means Australia has been at the forefront of irrigation water management and has adapted its management systems to cope with this variability. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Murray-Darling Basin is Australia~s most important region for irrigated agriculture.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Basin, which lies across four states and one territory, contains almost three-quarters of the nation~s irrigated land in Australia. It covers 1.06 million square kilometres. It is also the most regulated catchment in the world and is facing issues related to increasing dryland salinity, over-allocated 
water resources and declining water quality. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Murray-Darling Basin Initiative is a partnership between the Australian Government, each of the relevant state/territory governments and the community. It has led to significant achievements in tackling water resource and other natural resource issues including :</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Implementation of an upper limit on water diversions in the Basin </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Development and implementation of the Salinity Management Strategy </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A program of actions to improve the environmental outcomes for the Murray River and key surrounding wetlands to ensure the river‘s ongoing health.</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Challenges being addressed by Australian irrigation industries</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Managing rapid change (eg through implementation of water reforms)</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Responding to market signals, including for water management and use</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Improving efficiency

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1994, the Australian, state and territory governments made a historic agreement about the future management of water resources. The agreement was about new government policy and regulatory approaches to encourage efficient and sustainable management and use of resources.<br /><br />This meant encouraging effective responses to market signals from those directly involved in water resource management and from users. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The water reform framework encompassed urban and rural water and wastewater industries and includes economic, environmental and social objectives. The reform program was aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the provision of water services and instituting water management planning to take into account the effects of all water use by agriculture, industry, households and the environment.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The water reform framework explicitly linked economic and environmental issues within a coherent and integrated package of reform measures. These measures included :</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> pricing water for cost recovery and removing cross subsidies</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> comprehensive systems of water allocations and entitlements, separated from land, and backed by secure access rights to water </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> providing for 
trading in water entitlements</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> specific provision of water for ecosystems</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> water service providers to operate on a commercial basis</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> improved institutional arrangements, including separation of service provision from regulation and devolution of responsibility to the lowest possible level</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> public consultation and education.</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Measures did not preclude new development but required that investment in new infrastructure is both environmentally sustainable and economically viable. This includes full cost recovery of the construction and ongoing costs from beneficiaries of the new infrastructure.</font></p>
<p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All states and territories have actively implemented the reforms and have made significant progress. Water trading, for example, has increased. Local irrigators have taken 
on responsibility for irrigation management. And the environment has been recognised as a legitimate water user. </font></p><p> </p><p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">National Water Initiative</font></strong></p>
<p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In August 2003, the 
Council of Australian Governments agreed to refresh its 1994 water reform agenda to increase the productivity and efficiency of water use, sustain rural and urban communities, and ensure the health of river and groundwater systems.</font></p>
<p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The National Water 
Initiative is the next phase in improving management of water in Australia. The National Water Initiative provides an opportunity for a win-win outcome for both production and the environment and builds on the fundamental water reforms of the past ten years.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The National Water Initiative focuses on six key elements :</font></p>
<ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> a framework for nationally compatible water access entitlements, maximising economic value while maintaining healthy rivers and aquifers;</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> an efficient water market;</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> best practice water pricing;</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> integrated management of environmental water;</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> accurate measurement, monitoring and reporting; and</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> urban water reform.</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The National Water Initiative is about encouraging investment in the water industry and water-using industries while making explicit provisions to ensure sustainable management of the resource base. The focus is on resource allocation and investment based on market responses rather than top-down government policy.</font></p><p> </p><p class="style70"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Complementary programs/on-ground initiatives</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Australian Government is also addressing reform of the water industry and improved natural resource management through integrated action at the regional scale. Regions vary biophysically, socially and culturally engendering a range of possible responses to the social, economic and environmental values and threats they face. In developing regional solutions and actions it is also important to involve those closest to the problems and opportunities — landholders, industries and regional communities.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regional approaches complement and build on the progress achieved through the water reform framework, and other developments in natural resource management. Major regionally-based programs include the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. Information on these two programs can be obtained at <a href="http://www.nht.gov.au/index.html">http://www.nht.gov.au/index.html</a> and <a href="http://www.napswq.gov.au/">http://www.napswq.gov.au/</a> respectively.</font></p><p> </p><p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Research # Development</font></strong></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Australian Government has made substantial commitments to research and development that support sustainable use and management of our surface and ground water resources through a range of government funded research institutions. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The States and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission also undertake research and development supporting sustainable use and management of our water resources.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Irrigators contribute to commodity related research and development corporations through a levy system which raises funds that are then matched by the Australian Government. Research by these corporations address production and productivity issues as well as natural resource management issues relating to their particular commodity industry. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A number of Australia~s larger irrigation water service providers contribute to research and development supporting sustainable irrigation, as does ANCID.<br /><br /><strong>The Future </strong></font></p>

<p class="bodyText"> </p><p class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Irrigation</i></font></p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A system of water control and use has existed in the Gangetic delta for centuries. It consisted of broad shallow canals, which carried the top waters of the river floods, rich in fine silt, to the lands. They were so spaced that water could be distributed with reasonable facility to the rice fields, by means of cuts in the banks called ‘Kunwas~, which were closed when the flood season had passed. During the monsoons, much of the land is covered with water. To avoid inundation, villages are located on the higher ground 
generally made up by earth obtained from the excavation of tanks, which has the double advantage of retaining the monsoon water for use during 
the dry season.</font></p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The system of water control and use was managed and maintained by the Zamindars (landlords) and the tenants, on a more or less forced co-operative basis, known as ‘Pulbandi~. The long-drawn campaign of the Mahrattas and the Afghans, marking the decline of the Moghal Empire, brought about disorganisation and neglect in the proper maintenance of the system. Nonetheless, ‘Pulbandi~ persisted up to 1947 although in a less positive and effective manner. After 1947 reforms in land tenure were initiated and Government assumed the responsibility for maintenance of the works.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No major organized 
irrigation development was, however, carried out. The farmers have employed irrigation on a very small scale for many years. Water is lifted from wells and streams by primitive methods to irrigate vegetables, chillies, boro rice and betel leaf. More recently, small pumps have been employed for irrigating larger areas of boro rice and sugar cane. Irrigation projects to serve large areas have been unknown until the first half of the present century. Since 1955 a number of irrigation, drainage and flood control projects have been initiated.</font></p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To boost agricultural production a programme for development of irrigation by the use of small 
portable pumps was taken up in the 1960s. These pumps are put to use on purely temporary and seasonal locations along the smaller streams and 
waterlogged depressions to irrigate small areas upto 40.5 ha.</font></p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Bangladesh, hoping for some major surface water development, the expansion of minor irrigation 
(small-scale irrigation) has formed a vital component of the Government~s strategy in agriculture. Irrigation through major canals (large scale-irrigation) 
covered only 4% of the total irrigated area in 1996-97, the remainder was covered by minor irrigation consisting of low lift pumps (LLP~s: 
power operated centrifugal pumps drawing water from rivers, creeks and ponds), shallow tubewells (STW~s: with a motorised suction mode pumping 
unit), deep tubewells (DTW~s: with power operated force mode pumping unit), manually operated shallow tubewells for irrigation (MOSTI~s 
: extracting water from a shallow tubewell) and traditional systems. At the end of the dry season, the water level can fall beyond the suction 
limit of the centrifugal pump. In these situations, it is possible to draw water by placing the STW in a pit. Lowering of a STW in a pit is 
called a deep-set shallow tubewell (DSSTW) or a very deep-set shallow tubewell (VDSSTW). When the static water levels fall further (over 10.7 
m), submersible or vertical turbine pumps (FMTW~s : force mode tubewells) are needed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Between 1950 and 1987, 
public tubewells, regulations of private installations and public monopolies in the supply of pumps, motors and other equipment were a constraint to 
the development of irrigation. Since 1972, emphasis has been placed on minor irrigation through low lift pumps and mainly by tubewells (Shallow 
tubewells (STWs), Deep tubewells (DTWs) and Force mode tubewells (FMTWs)).</font></p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p>
<p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 1979 to 1984, there was a liberalised expansion of minor irrigation with STWs in the private sector. In 1981-82, about 0.20 million ha of land was under irrigation with 43,000 operating STW~s. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Currently, the potential 
for irrigation is estimated at 7,550,000 ha, of which about 3,690,000 ha had been brought under irrigation by 1996-97. Irrigation through major 
canals covers about 4% of the total area, the remainder being classified under minor irrigation consisting of surface water (low lift pumps and 
traditional systems) and groundwater (shallow tubewells and deep tubewells).<br /></font></p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p>
<p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At present, irrigation is practiced for boro rice (71%) and wheat (9%), which occupy together 80% of the irrigated land. Irrigation is mainly used in the dry season, although supplementary irrigation could appreciably increase transplanted aman rice production. The total harvested irrigated area is estimated at 3,690,000 ha, which does not account for wet season crops on area equipped with full or partial control irrigation. The national average irrigated paddy yield in 1996-97 for HYV boro was moderately high at 4.0 t/ha. In 1996-97, the total HYV boro rice production amounted to 7.10 million tones, which represents about 38% of the total grain production.</font></p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keeping in view the target of raising the cereal production level to 25 million tons by the year 2002 the fifth five-year plan seeks an overall accelerated growth in agricultural production and productivity.

<p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Bangladesh, the strategy of water resources development has so far pivoted around flood control and irrigation expansion to promote food grain production. Not denying the importance of food production and food security, it is now 
widely recognized that conflicts among, alternative and competitive uses of water are becoming sharper as population and demand for limited supplies 
of water are increasing. It is, therefore, necessary to formulate a long-term vision for integrated water resource management (IVA” to address 
the demands of all water-using sectors and maintain a sustainable environment. Hence, the water vision should reflect, in a holistic manner, a clear 
perspective of the management of the water ecosystem in the country by taking into account seasonal variations in availability, alternative uses 
and demands, mechanisms of water supply and demand management strategies, and the guidelines of the National Water Policy. A National Water Management Plan (NWNV) is underway in the light of the policy. <br />It is assumed that, by 2025, most of the actions/schemes under the NWW 
would have been implemented or is in the process of implementation. Based on this premise and the need to balance population growth, water demand 
for food, rural development, the strategic components of a long-term vision are briefly presented below. </font></p><p class="bodyText"> </p>

<p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because of its low-lying topography, at least 20% of the area of the country is flooded in a normal year. Flood control and drainage is used to reduce the depth of flooding or eliminate, through “controlled flooding”, untimely floods so as to provide greater security for the crop production.</font></p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1964, a master plan for water resource development was developed which envisaged the

with gravity drainage, tidal sluice drainage and pump drainage.</font></p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flood control and drainage projects have accounted for about half of the total funds spent

The approach should consist of a combination of structural and non-structural methods to mitigate flood damages and at the same time, retain the beneficial effects of inundation. However, flood mitigation measures must not be considered in isolation of other components of water resource development. These should be part of an integrated water management plan, along with food production, environment, fisheries, drainage, navigation and household supply. <br /></font></p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flood mitigation measures should also be addressed in the regional context. Bangladesh, being the- lowest riparian in the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna systems, face the fury of floods - although all other countries in the region also suffer from flooding of different levels of severity. Hence, there is a need for active cooperation amongst the countries of the GBM region for flood management. A comprehensive scheme of collection, transmission and exchange of real time relevant data among the GBM countries will promote efficiency in flood forecasting and disaster preparedness in Bangladesh. </font></p><p class="bodyText"> </p><p class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bangladesh and   ICID</b></font></p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"> </p><p align="justify" class="bodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bangladesh

The People~s Republic of Bangladesh lies in the north eastern part of South Asia between latitudes 20° 34? N and 26° 38? N and between longitudes 88° 01? E and 92° 41? E having a gross area of about 147,570 km<sup>2</sup> and is bounded on its west, north and north-east by India, on its south-east by Myanmar , and on its south by the Bay of Bengal.
The landmass of Bangladesh is extremely flat built by the delta-building activities of the three major rivers - the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna with some upland in the north-east and the south-east. The great plain lies almost at sea level along the southern part of the country and rises gradually towards north. Land elevation in the plain varies from 1 to 90 metres above sea level from south to north. The maximum elevation is 1230 metres above sea level at Keocradang hill in Rangamati hill district. The geo-morphology of the country comprises of a large portion of flood plains (79.1%), some terraces (8.3%) and hilly areas (12.6%)<br/><br/> Dhaka 164.4 14.4 23.7771760000 90.3994520000 5.22 1.5 8.53

Among the large national rivers, only the Amazon and the Paraguay are predominantly plain rivers and largely used for navigation. The Sao Francisco and Parana are the main plateau rivers. There are several important lakes, estuaries, coastal lagoons and wetlands. The country has also the largest wetlands – the Pantanal. The total volume of available water is estimated between 5327 and 5610 cubic km per year which is equivalent to 32870 - 35730 cu m per capita. It is estimated that 200,000 - 258000 cu m per second of water flows in the rivers representing about 18% of the world total. Of this total, about 90% is in the Amazonia region (North and Central-West regions) where only 15% of the population lives. The other 10% of the volume of water is found in the other three regions (North-East, South and South-East) that concentrate 85% of the population and represent 91% of the demand for water. Agriculture (and livestock) consumes 61% of the water, whereas industries use 18%, while municipal and domestic use accounts for 21%. Brazil also has 6 of the 54 largest dams built in the world having highest storage capacities. The scarcity of water is, however, increasing with more and more competition for its uses.</font></p>

Presently, a vast majority of irrigated areas is private, with only 4.2% of public irrigation schemes comprising about 120,000 ha. The potential for irrigated agriculture is estimated to be 49 million ha of which 33 million ha are low flat lands for flood irrigation (“varzeas”) and 16 million ha in upper lands.

The Swiss Confederation is a federal republic in the center of Western Europe, surrounded by Germany, France, Italy, Liechtenstein and Austria. Switzerland is a landlocked country with approximately 8 million people. The highest peak is 4,634 meters above sea level and the lowest point is 193 meters. The area of this small country is 41,285 square kilometers and most people live in the Plateau (30% of the country) while the mountains of the Alps and the Jura occupy the greater part of Switzerland. The Swiss Confederation has 4 official languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh.</p>
       <p class="bodyText">#nbsp;</p>
       <p class="bodyText">Switzerland had the highest average wealth per adult in 2013 and the nineteenth largest economy by nominal GDP although there are no natural resources like oil or metals. The success is due to specialized manufacturing. Additionally, another important sector is the service sector, especially banking, insurance and tourism. 3.3% of the working people are involved in the agriculture sector.</p>
       <p class="bodyText">#nbsp;</p>
       <p class="bodyText">The climate in Switzerland is largely affected by the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The prevailing winds from the west bring humid air from the sea to the land. In summer this has a cooling effect, in winter it is warming. In most areas, there is adequate rainfall during the whole year. In the alpine valleys, it is mostly dry because of the surrounding mountains. This is the case in Valais and Engadin. There, the average rainfall is 500 to 600 millimeters per year. In the most southern part of Switzerland, the Canton Ticino, the annual average is 2,000 millimeters. In the Plateau, north of the Alps, the annual rainfall is about 1,000 to 1,500 millimeters.</p>
       <p class="bodyText">#nbsp;</p>
       <p class="bodyText">The temperature in January is around 1 degree Celsius and in July about 17 degrees Celsius in the Plateau. In the Alps, the coldest temperature has an annual average of -7.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
       <p class="bodyText">#nbsp;</p>
       <p class="bodyText"><strong>Agriculture</strong><br />
         <br />
         Agricultural production is important in Switzerland with 23.4% of farmland and 12.4% of alpine agricultural land being farmed with 3.3% of the population working in agriculture. Nevertheless, the self-sufficiency rate with agricultural products is about 60%. Switzerland has a total of 1,050 square kilometers of farmland and about 4,385 square kilometers of high quality farmland. The farmland is under pressure of the construction of housing due to the growth of the population. Every second, there is one square meter of land lost to the construction of new buildings or infrastructure. </p>
       <p class="bodyText">#nbsp;</p>
       <p class="bodyText">Policies protect the traditional farming families by restricting the purchase of agricultural land to only skilled farmers and preferring those with a farming heritage. Also, the maximum price for the land is restricted to allow farmers to buy land without investors. Law protects the best farmland, therefore, its total area should not decrease.</p>
       <p class="bodyText">#nbsp;</p>
       <p class="bodyText">The number of farms declined from 79,500 in 1996 to 55,200 in 2013. About 11% are organic farms. In 2013, the average utilized agricultural area per farm was 19 hectares. The majority, 60% of farms, specialize in grazing livestock, mostly cattle, pigs and poultry. Dairy is still a major sector but is declining due to the low prices of milk. 71% of the agricultural area is used as grassland, the rest is used for specialized crops such as; cereals, potatoes, sugar and oilseeds.<br />
         <br />
         <strong>Irrigation and Drainage</strong><br />
         <br />
         Traditionally, irrigation was used in the early days in the very dry areas of de Valais, the dry valley surrounded by mountains. There, the farmers built a large system of wooden canals from the well around the mountains down to the valley. At present, these systems, “suonen”, are still in use but there are also modern systems in use to bring the water to the fruit trees, crops and vineyards. Due to the climate change, irrigation is now necessary in more places. It is also necessary when farmers grow vegetables or other products with high water needs.</p>
       <p class="bodyText">#nbsp;</p>
       <p class="bodyText">Drainage has been managed early on in Switzerland. With earthenware pipes and branches of fir trees, the farmers were very successful. Today, a great part of the best farmland in the Plateau has huge systems of drainage pipes, mostly made of plastic. This system of pipes has to be maintained regularly. </p>
       <p class="bodyText"><br />
       </p>
       <p class="bodyText"><strong>Drainage</strong><br />
         <br />
         In Switzerland, a third of the best farmland has a drainage system to ameliorate the soaked areas, this equals 18% of the total 1,050,000 hectares of farmland. For 11% of these systems, the water has to be pumped. </p>
       <p class="bodyText">#nbsp;</p>
       <p class="bodyText">62% of the drainage systems were built before 1960. Only 12% were built during the past 30 years. One-third of the pipes is in a bad state, almost half of the system is in a good state. The replacement value of the whole drainage systems is estimated at roughly US$5 billion. The documentation on the systems is not complete. In the years before 1960, the maps were drawn by hand and they were often not very accurate. It is sometimes difficult to find the old pipes again. At present, in most areas there are projects to digitalize the old maps and to put them in a GIS.</p>
       <p class="bodyText">#nbsp;</p>
       <p class="bodyText">To maintain the drainage systems, it~s important to invest in the annual maintenance and renewal. Each year, Switzerland invests an average of US$5 million for this maintenance. There are presently almost no new systems planned, because of the influence to biodiversity. There is some consideration to close systems in the marshlands to increase the biodiversity and decrease the output of carbon dioxide.</p>
       <p class="bodyText">#nbsp;</p>
       <p class="bodyText">In the years before 1960, the pipes were built in earthenware. Then, the plastic pipes were available. Today, it depends on the soil, which material is preferred. <br />
         <br />
         <strong>Irrigation</strong><br />
         <br />
         In Switzerland, irrigation had only local relevance in the past, because most of the farmland had enough rainfall. As mentioned, irrigation in the inner alpine valleys was important because of the dry climate. Because of this, there was no data available until 2006 when research was initialized by the Federal Office of Agriculture. </p>
       <p class="bodyText">#nbsp;</p>
       <p class="bodyText">In 2006, 43,000 hectares were regularly irrigated and another 12,000 hectares in dry years. The annual water demand in dry years is estimated at 144 million cubic meters. Over 40% of the area is grassland, 12% grapes and 10% vegetables. Approximately two-thirds of the water used is brought by the traditional wooden canals called “suonen” to the irrigation systems. The rest comes from rivers, creeks, lakes, canals or from the groundwater.</p>
       <p class="bodyText">#nbsp;</p>
       <p class="bodyText">Due to the change of climate, the demand for irrigation will rise. To build new systems, the federal law rules that the irrigation must be efficient and ecological. </p>

<p class="bodyText">Turkey occupies a total area of about 783&nbsp;560 km<sup>2</sup> of which approximately 10&nbsp;400 km<sup>2</sup> are inland lakes. It forms the bridge between Europe and Asia, with about 3 percent of its land in Europe (Thrace) and the rest in Asia (Anatolia). It is bordered by Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and the Islamic Republic of Iran in the east, by the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic in the southeast, by the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea in the south and west, by Bulgaria and Greece in the northwest, and finally by the Black Sea in the north. The total coastline is over 10&nbsp;000 km, compared to a total land border with other countries of about 2&nbsp;950 km in length. </p>
<p class="bodyText">The cultivated area of 26.6 million ha covers one-third of the total area of the country, of which about 10 percent is occupied by permanent crops, mainly vineyards, fruit trees and olives. </p><br/>
<p class="bodyText"><h3 class="bodyText"><b>Climate</h3></b></p><br/>
<p class="bodyText">Turkey has four seasons, but the climate varies widely across the country. Turkey experiences both maritime and continental weather patterns which, combined with its highly varied topography, cause extreme geoclimatic diversity. The Black Sea region in the north receives rain throughout the year and has both mild summers and mild winters. The southern coastal Mediterranean region is regarded as subtropical, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The Aegean region (Western Anatolia) has mountains which run roughly east to west (i.e. perpendicular to the coast) and which are interspersed with grassy floodplains. This region also has a Mediterranean type of climate with hot, dry summers and mild winters. Central Anatolia is a vast high plateau with an average altitude of 1&nbsp;132 meters above sea level and a semi-arid continental climate with hot and dry summers and cold winters.</p>

<p class="bodyText">The average annual temperature is 18-20 °C on the south coast, falling to 14-15 °C on the west coast, and fluctuates between 4 and 19 °C in the interior regions, depending on the distance from the sea and the altitude.</p>

<p class="bodyText">The average annual rainfall in Turkey is about 643 mm, with significant spatial and temporal fluctuations. Rainfall is scarce during the growing season in normal years in most parts of Turkey. Overall, the western and southern coastal regions receive 800-1&nbsp;000 mm of rainfall per year. The northern coastal zone (the Black Sea region) receives the highest annual rainfall (1&nbsp;260–2&nbsp;500 mm). Central Anatolia receives the lowest rainfall (200-600 mm) which, combined with high temperatures and high evaporation rates, causes drought during the summer months. Evaporation and/or evapotranspiration rates are high particularly in the southeast region, which receives almost no rainfall during the summer, and can reach more than 2&nbsp;000 mm/year. The southeast region records very low humidity levels, while the coastal regions have quite high levels, in line with precipitation rates.</p>

<p class="bodyText">Snow can be seen almost everywhere in Turkey, but the number of snowy days and the period covered by snow differ from region to region. There is one or less snowy day in the Mediterranean and Aegean regions, whereas in parts of eastern Anatolia there can be up to 120 days of snow. On the high mountains, snow cover can be seen throughout the year, which melts slowly.</p><br/>
<p class="bodyText"><h3 class="bodyText"><b>Population</b></h3></p><br/>

<p class="bodyText">The population of Turkey is 73.2 million (2005) with an average annual population growth rate of 1.4 percent whereas it was almost 2 percent per year in the previous decade. Population density is 93.4 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>. The rural population declined from 41 percent in 1990 to 33 percent in 2005. In 2006, about 98 and 96 percent of the urban and 95 and 72 percent of the rural population have access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation respectively.</p><br/>
<p class="bodyText"><h2 class="bodyText"><b>Economy, agriculture and food security</h2></b></p><br/>
<p class="bodyText">In 2006 the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was US$402.7 billion, and agriculture contributed almost 10 percent of GDP. The economically active population is about 35.2 million (2005) of which 61 percent is male and 39 percent female. In agriculture, 15 million inhabitants are economically active of which 35 percent is male and 65 percent female. The unemployment rate in 2005 was around 9 percent. In 2002 an estimated 1&nbsp;515 adults in Turkey were infected by HIV, but data on its impact on the labour force are not available.</p>

<p class="bodyText">Turkey is a major agricultural producer. Wheat is the staple food crop with a share of 67 percent in total grain production. The principal agricultural exports are field crops, industrial crops, fruit, vegetables, and small livestock. The share of crop production in total agricultural production is 73.5 percent. </p>

1 Dongfeng Weir Dongfeng weir is located in the Jiajiang county of Sichuan Province in south-west China in the lower reaches of Qingyijiang River, a tier 3 tributary of Yangtze River, where the river enters this county. Dongfeng Weir, built during the early time of Qing Dynasty in 1662 is a masterpiece of historic irrigation development and the greatest work of diversion irrigation without storage. It is an outstanding example of sustainable operation and management, great contribution to ecological conservation and development in its command for a period of more than 350 years.<br>The design and construction of the weir exemplifies the Chinese ancient philosophy of harmony with the nature. Dongfeng weir, as the water inlet, at that time was made of local material bamboo baskets filled with cobbles and earth-rock available from local mountains. The project consists of a group of the 12km main diversion canal, two secondary canals diverting into 4 by-canals, one tunnel, 11 aqueducts, 21 water-gates and other supporting facilities. The main diversion canal is connecting 10 previous micro canal systems the net of canals goes through Jiajiang county.<br>Before the construction of Dongfeng Weir and Canal system, Jiajiang County was drought prone. The Dongfeng weir and canal substantially promote the development of irrigation and economic along Qingyijiang River. Since the completion of works in 1662, sufficient irrigation water supply has ensured the agriculture stabilization and the social development with irrigated area has expanding by more than 10 times from 467 hectares to 5113 hectares, covering over 4 towns and 48 villages. The local multiple cropping index has increased to 2.68, and the cultivated area to 13367 hectares. The project has remained in use continuously for more than 350 years and underwent reconditioning twice to achieve increased and sufficient water supply. In 2006, when the once-in-a-century drought attacked Sichuan Province and led to severe water shortage in many places, thanks to Dongfeng Weir, Jiajiang County was not affected by this disaster and achieved a bumper harvest. The water reserve of Dongfeng Weir apart from playing a critical role in the fight against drought also replenishes groundwater sources and improves the ecological environment.<br>Two sub-canals through the county create a scenic and comfortable living environment for the residents. The sufficient water supply takes a chance in reducing the county pollution. The several changes of the site of the water intake ensured that not only the surface water of Qingyijiang River got diverted with reduced sediment load, but also helped maintain the ecological and water-soil conservation as well. Overall, the weir and canal system has made great contribution to irrigation farming, ecological conservation, and economy.<br>As a public infrastructure, the Dongfeng Weir with its water distribution system was originally built by local government of Qing Dynasty in 1662. The local people took charge of annual repair outlay, labor expenditure, and construction supervision the management mechanism which continued until 1949. Nowadays, Dongfeng Weir is managed by the local government and the residents. The local government take charge of the maintenance of the general canals and branch canals, meanwhile the water user association, in the village as a unit, is responsible for the sub-lateral canals. The project is providing sufficient, reliable and sustainable irrigation water supply, is now discharging combined function of irrigation, drainage, urban flood control, and catering to environmental needs.<br>Nowadays, Dongfeng Weir is managed jointly by the local government as well as the beneficiaries. The local administration is in charge of the maintenance of the general canals and branch canals, while the water user association is responsible for the sub-lateral canals.

2 Mulanbei Water Conservancy Project Mulanbei Water Conservation Project, which has served for nearly 1000 years, adopted unique planning, design and construction techniques well ahead of its contemporaries to retain fresh water and resist saline water intrusion. The project is situated on Mulan river, 4 km southwest to Putian city of Fujian province in southeast of China. The structure, completed in 1083, during the northern Song Dynasty, continues to be in operation to this day, irrigating over 9133 ha of farmland in the Putian Xinghua plains takes an important place in the world civil engineering.<br>It was scientifically designed as a structure that served the purpose of water retention, tide prevention, flood discharge, sand removal and water diversion. The site of this weir was selected based on early experiences perfectly balancing the shock from the upstream flood and the downstream sea tide. Located on the weak riverbeds near the ocean, the head works structures of Mulanbei water conservancy project included overflow weir, gravity dam, diversion dike, and sluice gate and diversion mouths at both banks. The adopted raft foundation effectively alleviated pier pressure on unit area. The sluice foundation and the weir were made of local granite.<br>Gate walls or piers were built on the weir while stone pillars inserted through the walls or piers into the river-bed base rock, pig iron was melted to fill the gaps, the pier stones of the weir and the gates were linked with shoe-shaped iron ingots. As such, the weir/gate formed an integrated whole. Iron ingot was used among the masonry to effectively maintain more than 930 years operation of Mulanbei project. Till this day, the project keeps its basic form of engineering construction in historical period.<br>Before the construction of Mulanbei project, no crops except cattail could grow in south and north plains. The project has ensured water supply for agriculture, industry and domestic life in the command area. It irrigates a farmland area of 10867 ha and benefits more than 500,000 people. Mulanbei project had completely changed the plain to a main production area of grain and sugarcane in Putian city.Mulanbei water conservancy project is a middle scale multi- purpose irrigation project for water diversion, water storage, water drainage and water retaining. It has contributed to the development of Xinghua plain. Not only does it supply water to industrial production, agricultural production and domestic life, it also plays a part in shipping transportation, aquaculture, especially in defending flood disaster. The project witnessed the increase in population and the fast development of agriculture in south China during Tang and Song dynasties.<br>Architects and builders of Mulanbei project are considered as guardians of the area and are fondly remembered to this day.Construction of Mulanbei project has been supervised under the government since Song dynasty. Special personnel took charge of annual repair outlay, labor expenditure, and construction supervision and so on. This kind of management mechanism continues til today. Currently, Mulan river administrative office and the local administrative office of the south and north canals are responsible for flood wall management in the area.

3 Tongjiyan Irrigation Structure Tongjiyan irrigation system located in Bihu plains in the southwest of Zhejiang Province comprises of a dam, canal system with gates and an aqueduct, etc.Tongjiyan dam initially constructed in 505 AD across Songyinxi River, 1.2 km upstream of its confluence with Oujiang River.<br>According to historical records, the Tongjiyan irrigation systems constructed before the Tang Dynasty (618-907), and then improved gradually and become a bamboo-irrigation system with gates, main canal, branch canals, sub lateral canals, and ponds in the Song Dynasties (960-1279). The Tongjiyan dam,constructed as rock-filled timber crib with 270 m long is the earliest arch-dam in the world. The dam construction technology was the most advanced technological levels in the world in early 6th-century. <br>
The dam used to get destroyed often during floods in Songyinxi River, necessitating it to be rebuilt in the next winter and spring seasons to meet irrigation needs.  This practice continued for about 700 years when the weir was replaced by a stone masonry dam in 1205. A sand-flushing sluice and a ship lock were built subsequently on the dam. Since then the Tongjiyan dam project has become a multi-functional project for water storage, water diversion,with overflowing, sand flushing, shipping facilities etc. Although it has under gone repairs subsequently, the location, structure, and construction materials of the dam have remained unchanged to this day while undergoing minor repairs periodically.<br>
The canal aqueduct is the earliest across-flows divided system in three dimensions in China. It was constructed in 1111. The existing Tongjiyan dam forms a low arch upstream of 120 degree. The length of dam is 275m. Its crest width and base width are 2,5m and 25m respectively.<br>
The main canal feeds three canals. The middle canal is the longest and irrigates largest area among the three. It runs through the irrigation area of Tongjiyan and finally flows into the Oujiang River. It is called the secondary main canal with 18.12 km long. The secondary main canal feeds branch canals and its distribution system.There are altogether hundreds of branch canals and sub-lateral canals including the south and north branch canals, with more than 70 gates located along the canals.<br>
According to historical records the irrigation area of Tongjiyan irrigation system had reached 2,000 ha by the thirteenth century. The scope of irrigation has not changed much since then. There are a number of ponds in the Tongjiyan irrigation system;some of them natural low lying areas, others dug manually. These ponds connect with the end of branch canals and sub-lateral canals and store the surplus water and serve to meet water demands in drought seasons.<br>
The Tongjiyan irrigation structure was jointly managed by officials and people -local government taking the responsibility of maintenance and repair of the irrigation structure while the non-government organization taking the responsibility for water allocation among users which have been recorded in the management regulation of the Tongjiyan irrigation structure inscribed on a stone now standing in the Zhan-Nan Sima temple beside the Tongjiyan dam. <br>
History records that the earliest Tongjiyan management regulation was made in 1092 and were further amended in 1169. The joint management system has lasted in the Tongjiyan irrigation area to this day.The management regulations had been framed in detail in respect of size of water gates, water allocation methods for irrigation, labors and materials of annual repairs, and maintenance of irrigation structures etc. With the development of society and irrigation technology, some new additions to the management regulations have been made.

4 Inaoigawa Irrigation Canal Inaoigawa Irrigation Canal located on the left bank of Osaka River in Japan is recognized for its organized operation and maintenance by local people thereby helping transform the Sanbongi area in Japan from a barren plain to one leading in rice production and serving as a source of spiritual home. Inaogawa irrigation canal is loved by people in the community and handed down to the present generation as a structure which recalls achievement of ancestors.<br>Inaogawa irrigation canal serves as the lifeblood of agriculture for Towada City, the fourth largest city and one of leading rice producers in Aomori Prefecture. Sanbongihara which is the former name of the area including Towada City was an alluvial fan covered with volcanic ash generated from the eruption of Mt. Towada. The volcanic ash impaired the soils ability to retain water resulting in immediate seepage of rainwater into the ground. The project faced many difficult hurdles requiring high technical capabilities to overcome, such as, construction of two tunnel weirs and a land weir.<br>The project was taken up more than 160 years ago when the planning design and construction of most civil engineering works in Japan depended heavily on foreign engineers. This reclamation project was carried out primarily by Nanbu tsuchikatasyu, a group of construction technicians and completed by Japanese techniques only. This group of tunneling workers, having the most excellent special techniques in the domain, carried out construction in an extremely organized manner with the level, the Azimuth instrument and the rope measure used at that time. It is considered that the technician group used traverse calculation using Hassen table; a Japanese style of trigonometric function table. The project was constructed using man power only. Inaogawa irrigation canal has helped transformation of Sanbongi from a barren plain 160 years ago to one of leading rice producers in Aomori Prefecture and has contributed to development not only in agriculture but also of other sectors of the entire region.<br>In 1855, the rulers launched a
large-scale reclamation project in Sanbongihara with the construction of
Kuradeyama weir and Tenguyama weir and a canal through which water was passed
on a trial basis on April 24, 1858. After repair work, on May 4, 1859, about
four years after the start of the project, water was successfully taken to
Sanbongihara and in 1860, the canal was named Inaogawa irrigation canal.<br>Though the Irrigation system of Sanbongihara was successfully completed, but it did not have sufficient supplies of water to reach up to the Pacific coast. Accordingly, another plan was developed to build an intake further upstream which comprised of three tunnel weirs and an additional canal meeting Inaogawa irrigation canal. Tunneling work was started from the north side of Kuradeyama tunnel weir, but could not be completed. Subsequently the second water diversion plan was undertaken as a national reclamation project and finally completed in 1866.<br>The project has undergone several changes over the years. Modernization and development projects have been implemented since then, converting
Sanbongigahara into one of the most productive areas of rice production in
Aomori Prefecture, which now covers approximately 5,300 hectares of field. The
canal reaching to the Pacific Ocean was completed during the period 1937 to
1966. Then, from 1978 to 2006, the national farm irrigation project 
on the left bank of Osaka River was implemented to solve constant water shortage
and poor drainage and to ensure stable supply of water and reduce the workload
for operation and maintenance. Farmers, local residents and relevant
organizations such as National Federation of Land Improvement Associations are
working together to take new operation and maintenance measures for the
canal.

5 Ogawazeki Irrigation Canal The Ogawazeki irrigation canal is a precious historical heritage which has been handed down to the present generations since the pre-clan times. It is estimated that a masonry irrigation structure of the Ogawazeki irrigation canal (the main canal) was constructed over 400 years ago, which was followed by branch canal system, but the exact year of construction is not known. A monument of renovation of Ogawazeki irrigation canal water intake (built in 1943) bears the inscription saying it was told Ogawazeki irrigation canal was constructed by the ancients‚ and this suggests that there had been an old Ogawazeki irrigation canal since the pre-clan times. There are no historical materials left which tell the objectives of the canal system at the time of construction. But, it is true that the canal system has offered water for household use, emergency use and irrigation in downriver paddy fields through the ages.<br>The water to the Ogawazeki irrigation canal is diverted through 7 meters high barrage on Ogawa River running from <b>Mt. Inafukumi</b> and located below Ohgi Bridge 3 km away to the south from Obata, an area in Kanra Town. The water intake called "large gate" regulates the amount of water flowing into the canal according to the amount of rainfall. The total length of Ogawazeki irrigation canal is approximately 20 km. Both the main and branch canals are lined using lining material which was a mixture of clay and lime applied on the inside. After the hardening of the core, rocks were piled up on the surface to prevent the washing away of the barrage.<br>Obata area which is located in the upper reaches of the river takes water from the canal for household use while the downstream areas of Fukushima and Niiya draw water for irrigation.In 1957, Obata private water supply system was completed. Since then, Ogawazeki irrigation canal had been used as a drainage canal, not as a household water canal, resulting in water pollution. Since the late 1960s, the increased use of synthetic detergent had brought exacerbation of pollution and Ogawazeki irrigation canal was heavily contaminated. However after considerable efforts of local residents in the mid-1970s and carrying out of improvement work of public sewage system by the local administration the irrigation canal has been restored to its original status of clean canal.<br>Although the canal system has undergone some renovations such as a replacement of the masonry structure with a concrete embankment, expansion of a road and reinforcement by working concrete grout into joints, it has maintained the appearance since the old days as a whole. Water quality has also been maintained by the efforts of local residents.<br>Ogawazekin Irrigation Canal taking off from Ogawa River in Japan is recognized for the active participation of farmers in maintaining the canal system in its designed conditions by regularly removing sand and earth accumulated on the intakes, and sweeping waste accumulated on the barrage to ensure free and smooth flow in the canal. Operation and maintenance of the canal facilities is performed by the local government body. Renovation programmes are implemented every year with the cooperation from national and prefectural governments to ensure that the canal functions as an irrigation canal. The Town has pledged to make continued efforts to maintain and restore the functions of the canal system and hand it down to the future generations.<br> Japan 36.23266 138.91926 36.23266 138.91926 images/his/ogawazeki_1.jpg images/his/ogawazeki_2.jpg images/his/ogawazeki_3.jpg images/his/ogawazeki_4.jpg images/his/ogawazeki_5.jpg images/his/ogawazeki_6.jpg images/his/ogawazeki_7.jpg images/his/ogawazeki_8.jpg images/his/ogawazeki_9.jpg images/his/ogawazeki_10.jpg images/his/ogawazeki_11.jpg Unknown -- About 400 years ago.

6 Sayamaike Reservoir Sayamaike Reservoir on Nishiyoke River serving the large-scale irrigation area of Osaka Plains is the oldest artificial agricultural reservoir in Japan dating back to 1,400 years and continues to be in use to this day.<br>When the reservoir was constructed, artificial twig-mattresses (shikisoda) were used to reinforce the banks. This technology, used widely in the East Asian region, was introduced to Japan through the Korean Peninsula. The 60 meter-long gutters, which drained the water from the pond, were made by hollowing out Japanese umbrella pines, and the gutter connections were designed to prevent the water from leaking. In addition, for the repairs made 800 years ago, it is thought that technologies for processing stone and constructing large structures were introduced from China. Thus it is an important heritage that proves the technological exchanges made with East Asia during those days.<br>During the repairs carried out 800 years ago, the size of the reservoir was not changed except for the banks, which were raised to approximately 10.2 meters. The gutters beneath the banks, however, formerly made of wood, were now made of stone to stabilize the water supply. The irrigated area now is double that of 1,400 years ago, increasing downstream crop production.<br>The current size of the Sayamaike Reservoir was attained during the repairs carried out about 400 years ago, when the water supply was increased to approximately 2.50 million m3. It was also decided to make provision for supplying water to the 80 or so downstream villages. The water supply system, management and organization established during these repairs are still in use today.<br>Repairs carried out within the past 100 years used concrete and heavy machinery to create a more stable supply of water. During the recent repairs, disaster prevention functions and measures were taken to make sure that the reservoir can be used in urban conditions.<br>With the rapid economic growth after the Second World War, large landslides flowed into the Sayamaike Reservoir due to the development of dormitory towns in the upstream areas of Osaka, now a metropolis. The surrounding areas have continued to be developed after the dam was constructed, and the Sayamaike Reservoir is now used as a recreational area for the citizens. The reservoir is cleaned every month by a civic organization and festivals are also held in the area.<br>The structure is an outstanding example of Operation and Management over a long period of time. The rotational irrigation water delivery system that began in the 1600s is still used today.

7 Fukarayousui Irrigation Canal Fukarayousui Irrigation Canal in Japan has the engineering excellence in construction of tunnel dug using hand and chisels and thereby blessing the command area with abundant paddy production and bringing affluence.<br>The
Fukarayousui Irrigation Canal, located in the Kano River Basin, is an irrigation
structure completed in the 17th century, brings water from Lake Ashinoko
(located in Hakone, Ashigarashimo-gun, Kanagawa Prefecture, through a tunnel to
the Fukara district (in Susono City, Shizuoka Prefecture). From there onwards it
flows through the Fukara River to the Kise River, thereby delivering water for
irrigation. The Fukara district, where the structure was made, is located in
the western foothills of Mt. Hakone, to the southeast of the Mt. Fuji
foothills. Fukara villagers were unable to grow rice, the main crop in Japan at
that time, and were forced to rely on grains that could withstand drought such
as barley and soybeans. They led lives of hardship for many years.<br>To
simultaneously resolve chronic water shortages and facilitate the planting of
new rice fields, the village headman, Ohba Gennojo, laid out plans for
diverting water from Lake Ashinoko in Hakone to the village of Fukara through a
tunnel. As the work was done manually, it was not possible to dig straight through some cliffs, because of the problem of ground collapses due to the soft and fragile ground of Mt. Hakone. The work was completed in three and a half by February 1670, and water began flowing through in April of that year. The tunnel has a total length of 1,280 m with a height differential of 9.8 m between the sluice gate of the Lake and the tunnel exit, and an average gradient of 1/130 over the length of the tunnel.<br> Over 340 years have passed since the Fukarayousui Irrigation Canal was completed, but it still plays a vital role as an irrigation structure, providing water for the agriculture of the region and in recent years also for household use and hydropower generation. The tunnel is also characterized by breathing holes above it large enough for an adult person to enter. These were dug for ventilation. There are also two vertical shafts connected via side holes, each about 30m in length and connecting the tunnel to the surface of the ground.<br> The water flow capacity of the tunnel is the same as when it was first dug. The canal is still used for agricultural irrigation (of rice paddies). When the structure was first built, it was used solely as an irrigation canal, but since the Taisho Period (1912-1926) it has also been used for hydropower generation.<br>A water management committee, established in 1688, is in charge of managing the Fukarayousui Irrigation Canal which remains unchanged to this day.

8 Ziquejie Terraces Located in Hunan Province of South Central China Ziquejie Terraces are built on hills with altitude ranging from 460m-1540m and surface slope varying between 25<sup>o</sup>-40<sup>o</sup>. Enjoying an average annual precipitation of 1700 mm, the area is rich in water resources.The lack of plains at Ziquejie has forced the ancient people to reclaim terraces which were chiselled into shapeby the 10thcentury AD.<br>Covering a total area of 6416 hectares, Ziquejie Terraces are the fruit of Ziquejie people~s wisdom and hard work and an excellent example of overall planning and sustainable exploitation of water and land resources. As a full-fledged gravity irrigation project built with simple technology and natural materials, Ziquejie Terraces are perfectly adapted to local conditions and have provided local farming system with water guaranteed for more than 1000 years and serve as tool for water and soil conservation and artificial wetlands.<br>The irrigation and drainage system of Ziquejie Terraces is made up of three parts: water storages, irrigation and drainage canal system, and control devices. In the valleys of Ziquejie, there are many streams that do not dry up throughout the year. These streams are damned up with small weirs. In normal times, these weirs ensure diversion of water to the terraces; during torrential rains, the flood water overflows from the top of the weirs. Water inlets are located a few meters upstream of the weirs. The angle between the mouth and the stream is larger than 60<sup>o</sup> so as to ensure safety. The weirs are equipped with grit chambers and flushing sluices to reduce silting of canals. Ridges with 0.2-0.3m height convert the terrace fields in to major water retaining structures with a capacity of 10 million m<sup>3</sup>. Coupled with the abundant water retained within the soil, the water-retaining terrace fields provide adequate water supply for the terrace agriculture. For delivering water to the platform fields on independent hills, local people set up bamboo tubes as aqueducts. Bamboo tubes are also employed for trans-altitude water delivery to avoid erosion of the ridges.<br>Ziquejie Terraces fully utilize natural valleys and streams as the main drainage canals. Besides, drainage outlets are built in the proper place of the terrace fields and canals to ensure the discharge of water logging and tail water. Perpendicular to the contours, these valleys and streams can either be dammed up to be water sources or serve as main drainage canals.<br>The expansion of farmland has facilitated the development and integration of different ethnic groups. Today, Ziquejie Terraces still support more than 17000 people of 16 villages, and the traditional way of life and cultural diversity have been retained. The unique but scientific water-land development method and the simple but developed irrigation and drainage system have helped Ziquejie break the rules that hills with slope greater than 25<sup>o</sup> are not suitable for terraces.<br>As the result of rice farming expanding from plains to mountainous regions, Ziquejie Terraces have witnessed the spread of irrigation methods and the integration and development of ethnic groups. The local village organizations in charge of water distribution and project maintenance are still subject to unwritten village rules and conventions that have been in effect for thousands of years. According to these rules and conventions, water from canals of higher altitude irrigates terrace fields of higher altitude, while water from canals of lower altitude irrigates terrace fields of lower altitude, thereby fully employing the gravity. Thanks to local people~s careful maintenance, the 6416 hectares of Ziquejie Terraces are still in good shape and functioning well.

37 Balloki Barrage Balloki Barrage, constructed on River Ravi, is located about 60 km D/S of Lahore, the capital of Punjab, Pakistan,. The Barrage feeds two canal systems viz. Lower Bari Doab Canal and Balloki Sulemanki Link Canals.<br>This structure was constructed in 1913 in the form of a level crossing where supply from the Upper Chenab was dropped into the river Ravi on the right bank, crosses it at bed level and was taken off on the right bank at Balloki in 1913. The group of works consists of an inlet, a barrage, a regulator, and training works. <br/>
The barrage consists of a weir 1646.5 feet extreme length divided into 35 bays each 40 feet clear by piers 7.25 feet wide. In this locality where fine sand forms the river bed the floor is especially wide to reduce the danger from blowing up. The flank walls and piers are 22.34 feet high and are surrounded by steel trestles, which carry the operating platform. The gates are counterbalanced on the Stony principle and the machinery is geared to lift the gates at short notice and lower them according to the requirements of the regulation. A road way crosses the barrage, on the downstream side of the gates.<br/>
The Head regulator has 15 bays each 20 feet clear divided by piers of 3.8 feet wide. There is a permanent sill 6.41 feet high and a further temporary sill of 2.5 feet height obtained by rising gate 2.75 feet high, making it possible to exclude heavy silt from the canal channel. The gates are in two parts, the upper falling and lower rising to shut the vents. There is a road way over the regulator and upstream of this is the platform carrying the operating machinery, which has been geared to close the vents quickly and open at leisure.<br/>
The training works consist of a number of bunds and groynes and are intended to bring the stream true to the barrage and convey it to a safe distance downstream.

29 Yamadazeki Barrage System located on Chikugo River Basin in Japan is recognized for using various
innovative techniques in project formulation, engineering design and
construction, ahead of its time.<br>Yamadazeki Barrage was constructed in 1790, Horikawayousui Irrigation Canal in 1663, and Horikawayousui Waterwheels (the
completion of the Tripler wheels) in 1789. The Barrage, 320 meters in length and
3 meters in height, was built as a sloping floor-type stone barrage,
when no other weir of this type existed in Japan. It is the only
sloping floor-type stone weir in Japan and is characterized by its
elaborate and strong enough structure to endure great water pressure and
rushing torrents of the Chikugo River, the longest river of the Kyushu Region.<br>In the Asakura Region, the farming industry is supported by the irrigation
facilities made possible due to construction of Yamadazeki Barrage on
Chikugo River, the Horikawayousui Irrigation Canal taking off from the barrage
and a system of Waterwheels consisting of one unit of triple wheels and two units of double wheels are all set up on Horikawayousui Irrigation Canal to carry
water to rice paddies located above the Canal level The water wheels, composed of wooden wheels four to five meters in diameter and several buckets, are driven automatically by the water flow of Horikawayousui Irrigation Canal. The system is
capable of delivering 553,000 m3 per day from the Chikugo River to irrigate an area of 652 ha.<br>A variety of innovative mechanisms seen in its design demonstrate that the weir was built with engineering techniques which are
comparable to the present day techniques The weir was constructed adopting the "Karaishi-zumi", a stone masonry technique of piling up field stones in an elaborate manner. Nonetheless, the weir maintains the original form of the days it was constructed. The weir has an environment-friendly design which ensures sand free inflows to the canal and the waterwheels and allows fish to move freely and avoids interfering with shipping transport a prosperous industry of the days when it was constructed.

9 23rd ICID Congress and 68th IEC Invitation from the President of ICID&lt;br/&gt;
It is widely acknowledged that in order to ensure food security for a burgeoning global population, there is a need to usher in second Green Revolution in many developing countries. Under the new post-2015 sustainable development regime to be adopted shortly by the UN General Assembly, the second green revolution will have to follow a different trajectory of food production, avoiding the pitfalls of the first green revolution such as intensive use of chemicals and water in food production. The second green revolution will have to be based on frugal use of water and zero tolerance on environmental degradation. It will have to depend on higher per unit of water productivity, principles of better irrigation and drainage services, and appropriate harnessing of the new technologies.&lt;br/&gt;
With the above background, it gives me great pleasure to invite you to the 23rd International Congress on Irrigation and Drainage to deliberate on the theme &lt;b&gt;?Modernizing Irrigation and Drainage for a new Green Revolution?.&lt;/b&gt; The 23rd Congress together with the 68th International Executive Council (IEC) will be hosted by our Mexican National Committee MXCID from 8-14 October 2017 at Mexico City, Mexico. 2017-10-08 2017-10-14 World Trade Center, Mexico City 62 http://www.icid2017.org/ info@icid2017.org +52 (555) 550.48.93

Keep Your Skin Moist and Youthful With Hyaluronic Acid! 
 
Hyaluronic Acid is a Safe and Natural Anti-Aging and Moisturizing Substance! 
 
Instead of trying odd artificial products with little to no science behind them, using Hyaluronic acid is certainly the better choice. It is a natural ingredient of human skin, which helps it look plumper and prevent wrinkles. Look Younger the Natural Way! Babies have a lot of Hyaluronic acid in their skin, making it so deliciously soft and smooth. By rubbing hyaluronic acid twice a day into your skin, you can regain some of that smoothness in time, giving you a younger look and healthier skin. 
 
It works on ALL skin types and of course it works just as well on men as it does on women! No matter if you have oily, dry or mixed skin; Hyaluronic acid will work just as deeply and thoroughly. Take Control of Your Skin's Health! Our skin needs a lot of care to retain its youthful elasticity and looks. As we age, our skin loses a lot of its Hyaluronic acid and collagen. 
 
This causes wrinkles to appear, especially after the age of 40. By replenishing some of that Hyaluronic acid, we can delay aging and retain youthful looks for a lot longer. 
 
Get rid of Sagging and Minimize the Appearance of Pores! 
 
Hyaluronic Acid: 
- Makes Pores Less Visible 
- Diminishes Redness 
- Lifts and Firms Sagging Skin 
- Gives You Softer and Smoother Skin Texture

1) Venturi Injectors for efficient, uniform, low energy, maintenance free addition of liquid fertilizers/chemicals into pressurized irrigation systems; 
2) AirJection®  Irrigation which lets growers “Plow without a Plow” by getting the right amount of air (O2/N2) into the root zone—delivering higher crop yields, early maturation, improved water efficiency and soil health; and the 
3) New Tru-Blend™ Proportional Chemigation System with monitoring and reporting features to assure growers are feeding what is needed, when it is needed, and to where it is needed. 

In addition to products developed specifically for the agricultural market, Mazzei is a leader in mixing and contacting technologies for various markets, providing chemical, aeration and ozone treatment. Mazzei patented technologies make these processes easier, more efficient, less expensive and more reliable. 
For wastewater problems, Mazzei~s AirJection® Wastewater Aeration technology recirculates wastewater from basins through Mazzei® Injectors to draw in air or concentrated oxygen and dissolve it into the wastewater.  The resulting gas-water mixture is returned to the basin through MTM Mixing Nozzles for greater oxygen transfer and basin mixing— and no maximum depth limitations.
To solve water quality issues ranging from disinfection to purification to aesthetics, Mazzei GDT™ Ozone Contacting System can do the trick.  Mazzei Injectors aspirate ozone gas from a generator providing dynamic mixing and mass transfer. Dissolution is enhanced in a Flash Reactor™, and then the contacted two-phase flow travels to the degas separator for additional mixing and entrained gas removal to appropriate off gas processing. No other system transfers ozone into solution faster than GDT Process.

T-L~s headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in Hastings, Nebraska .

TL Irrigation Systems: T-L~s exclusive hydrostatic drive design offers substantial advantages not available on electrically driven systems. Each tower of a T-L system moves continuously delivering uniform water application especially important for chemical distribution. Continuous movement reduces the chances of getting stuck and reduces wear on drive components significantly.
T-L~s hydrostatic drive design provides maximum torque while automatically adjusting for the varying tower flow requirements determined by the rotation speed. A pressure compensating, variable flow hydraulic pump supplies only the power required, not the maximum 100% of the time.
T-L~s specially formulated hydraulic fluid, Hydroclear(TM), is non-toxic, environmentally friendly, superior in lubricating performance, and extends component service life. Hydroclear (TM), will last the lifetime of the system if the recommended filter changes and service intervals are performed.
