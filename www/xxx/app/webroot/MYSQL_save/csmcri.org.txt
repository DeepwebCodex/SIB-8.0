1 1 Cost-effective process for production of ultrapure solar salt on large scale Patented,Field Tested,Demonstrated Salt and Marine Chemicals
2 1 Cost-effective process for recovery of low sodium salt from bittern R.N. Vohra US Patent No:  6,890,509 A new process for recovery of Low Sodium Salt from bittern has been described in the present invention, the said process comprising desulphatation of bittern (by-product of salt industry), evaporation of bittern in solar pans and processing of solid mixture with water to produce a mixture of sodium and potassium chlorides and optionally preparing "free flowing" and iodized, by known techniques. <h2>Advantages of the invention:</h2></br>
(i)	The ratio of KCl and NaCl can be adjusted in the range from 20% KCl to 70% KCl according to customer requirements by varying the baume density at which the carnallite crystallizer pan is charged. Ms/ Archean Group of Chemical Industries , Chennai Patented,Licensed Salt and Marine Chemicals
3 1 Device for remote monitoring of brine density in salt works P K Ghosh US Patent No:  6,865,942 The present invention relates to a novel device that enables a person to gauge the brine density in solar salt works from afar without recourse to sampling of the brine. The device--which can be considered as an improvisation over the conventional laboratory type Baume meter can be placed directly in the salt pan. The device remains sunk, and therefore invisible, until the desired density of brine is approached. Thereafter it gradually floats up and becomes visible from afar. From appropriate markings on the rod connected to the top end of the device, it can be gauged whether the brine is yet to attain the desired density, or has attained the desired density range, or has exceeded the desired density range. The device is resistant to corrosion and able to combat extreme weather conditions prevailing in solar salt works. The control of brine density from afar helps eliminate the need for frequent sampling of brine for density measurement that would make adherence to the optimum process of salt production easier. The methodology can be extended to production of other marine chemicals such as carnallite and kainite. <h2>Advantages of the invention:</h2></br>
The material of construction of the device is compatible with any brine of any concentration, and is tolerant to the corrosive property of brine and the large temperature variations in the solar salt works that are typically set up in semi-arid regions. The materials used for construction of the device are fiber reinforced plastic and stainless steel. The configuration of the device is so made as to minimize accumulation of salts that might alter the precision of the device. Units given to Gujarat Heavy Chemicals Ltd., for testing.  Units helped to
improve the quality of salt. Patented Salt and Marine Chemicals
4 1 (a) Preparation of highly stable iodizing agent; </br>
(b) cost-effective iodizing agents and their preparation P K Ghosh US Patent Application No: 12/086 542 The present invention is directed to provide a novel iodized salt that is iodized by- the mixture of iodide and iodate in 5:1 molar ratio is used for iodization of salt and is shown to be a source of latent elemental iodine that can be liberated from the salt under acidic conditions such as that which prevails in the stomach.  The iodizing agent is stabilized in the salt by adjusting pH to be in the range of 7.5-8.0.  The said iodizing agent may be prepared cost-effectively through the reaction of pure iodine crystals with a suitable alkali. <h2>Advantages of the invention:</h2>/br>
i.	Iodine in the form of more potent elemental iodine can be delivered in the stomach through the vehicle of salt. </br>
ii.	The iodizing agent of the present invention would be both easier and cheaper to produce than either of the conventional iodizing agents used hitherto for salt iodization, namely pure iodide or iodate salts.</br>
iii.	Delivery of iodine in the form of elemental iodine via the iodide-iodate system may lead to greater efficacy of treatment of iodine deficiency disorders. </br> Yet to be licensed Patented Salt and Marine Chemicals
5 1 Integrated process for the recovery of sulphate of potash and refractory grade magnesia from sea bittern P K Ghosh US Patent No:  7,041,268 The present invention is directed to a novel integrated process for the recovery of sulphate of potash (SOP) from sulphate rich bittern. The process requires bittern and lime as raw materials. Kainite type mixed salt is obtained by fractional crystallization of the bittern, and is converted to schoenite which is subsequently reacted with muriate of potash (MOP) for its conversion to SOP. End liquor from kainite to schoenite conversion (SEL) is desulphated and supplemented with MgCl<sub>2</sub>using end bittern generated in the process of making carnallite. Decomposed carnallite liquor produced is reacted with hydrated lime for preparing CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution and high purity Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> having low boron content. It is shown that the liquid streams containing potash are recycled in the process, and the recovery of potash in the form of SOP is quantitative. <h2>Advantages of the invention:</h2></br>
	(i)	SOP is a dual fertilizer containing 50% K<sub>2</sub>O and 18% sulfur.</br>
	(ii)	SOP is virtually free of chloride and hence ideal for saline soils and chloride sensitive crops.</br>
	(iii)	SOP has lower salt index i.e low osmostic effect</br>
      Salt index of sodium nitrate  =  100</br>
      Muriate of potash (MOP)       =  116.3</br>
      Nitrate of potash (KNO<sub>3</sub>)       =  73.6</br>
      Sulphate of potash (SOP)       =  46.1</br> Ms/ Archean Group of Chemical Industries , Chennai Patented,Licensed Salt and Marine Chemicals
6 1 Process for the preparation of refractory grade magnesia of >97% purity and requiring less water in the process 12/400512 and 11/376707 The present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of MgO of high purity >99% from salt bitterns via intermediate formation of Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> obtained from the reaction of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and lime, albeit indirectly, i.e., MgCl2 is first reacted with NH3 in aqueous medium and the slurry is then filtered with ease. The resultant NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-containing filtrate is then treated with any lime, to regenerate NH<sub>3</sub> while the lime itself gets transformed into CaCl<sub>2</sub> that is used for desulphatation of bittern so as to recover carnallite and thereafter MgCl<sub>2</sub>of desired quality required in the present invention. The crude Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>is dried and calcined directly to produce pure MgO, taking advantage of the fact that adhering impurities in the Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> either volatilize away or get transformed into the desired product, i.e., MgO. <h2>Advantages of the invention:</h2></br>
The main advantage invention is that Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> obtained from the reaction of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and ammonia in aqueous medium, which is very easy to filter, requires no further purification and can directly yield MgO of high purity, thereby largely eliminating the tedious nature of work up encountered in the conventional process of preparation of MgO from purified Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>.

Such uncertainties will remain in feature as well. Over exploitation of ground water for different uses, the water quality has deteriorated considerably and becoming increasingly more brakish. All of this has made it imperative to study crops with greater degree of salt tolerance. The plants are generally not tolerant to salt but there are certain plants occurring in nature that grows under high saline conditions. One such plant that has a great economic potential is <i>Salicornia brachiata</i>. Tender tips of <i>Salicornia</i> which are salty is taste have become popular as a salad is west. Seeds from the plant contain 25 – 35% oil which is rich in linolenic acid and closely resembles safflower oil. CSMCRI has developed agrotechnology for cultivations of the species and in the process germplasm was also improved for higher yield with recurrent selections. To make it <i>salicornia</i> cultivations economically more attractive besides oil and vegetable tips a process to produce vegetable salt from the waste biomass after removing the seeds for oil was developed.

2 Preparation of Synthetic hydrotalcite - Halogen scavenger grade and Pharmaceutical grade <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Synthetic hydrotalcites (SHT), also known as anionic clays or layered double hydroxides are rarely found in nature. They are functionally akin to zeolites. The structure of SHT is very similar to brucite, Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Magnesium is octahedrally surrounded by six oxygens in the form of hydroxides; the octahedral units then, through edge sharing, form infinite sheets. The sheets are stacked on top of each other through hydrogen bonding. When some of the magnesium in the lattice is isomorphously replaced by higher charged cation, e.g. Al<sup>3+</sup>, then the resulting overall single Mg<sup>2+</sup> - Al<sup>3+</sup> -OH layers gains a positive charge. Sorption of an equivalent amount of hydrated anions render the structure electrically neutral. The anion is frequently found to be carbonate. A typical hydrotalcite may be represented by formula such as Mg<sub>4.5</sub> Al<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>13</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.3H<sub>2</sub>O. Many modification of this structure can be made by changing the Al to Mg ratio.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span>SHT finds application in pharmaceutical industry as an antacid. SHT has also replaced heavy metal based heat stabilizers for PVC. SHT like compounds are imported under the trade name like DHT-4A, L-55R-II and Alcamizer. They are used as halogen scavenger in plastic processes such as the production of polypropylene. It deactivates the residual quantities of acidic substances associated with acid catalysts used in producing polymers. CSMCRI has developed processes to prepare pharmaceutical grade and halogen scavenger grade SHT.</span></p> <P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify" align=justify>Bittern and soda ash are reacted to make magnesium precursor.

3 Electrodialysis Domestic Desalination System <p align="justify"><span>CSMCRI has developed electrodialysis desalination system for domestic uses, which can provide drinking water of WHO specifications from brackish or ground-water with TDS about 3000 ppm. Indigenous ion-exchange membranes and electrodialysis unit used in this system was developed by this institute. Inbuilt ozonator ensures complete destruction of pathogens.</span></p> <P class=hridltrivedi style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify" align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Electrodialysis (ED) is a membrane process by which ions are separated from making brackish water free from salts. CSMCRI has been in the forefront in developing membranes for ED. Two types of membranes, anion and cation exchange membrane are arranged in an ED stack alternately between two electrodes, kept in electrode chambers. Brackish water is passed between the membranes while a DC electric field is applied across the electrodes. Anions pass through anion exchange membrane and cations through the cation exchange membrane, making the water depleted of salt. Cations cannot pass through the anion exchange membrane and anions do not pass through cation exchange membrane which they encounter in the adjacent compartment and therefore one stream will turn diluate and adjacent stream into the concentrate waste. Both the streams are collected separately. Diluate stream is drinking water and the concentrate stream is discharged.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>

4 Preparation of novel iodizing agent. <p align="justify"><span>Iodine is a very important trace element necessary in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. Iodine is required for developing and maintaining healthy body. There are well known Iodine Deficiency Disorder like Goiter and Cretinism. The edible salt is chosen as vehicle in the provision of iodine because of its uniform consumption and availability to all segments of population independent of social or economic status. During the past twenty years ,there has been strong effort, lead by the United Nationals, to iodize all the salt for human consumption.Potsssium iodate and potassium iodide are most often used in iodizing the edible salt. The Food and Nutrition Board of National Research council of the <country-region w:st="on"></country-region><place w:st="on"></place>USA placed<span>&nbsp; </span>the optimum requirement of iodine at 150-300 ug per day, and considering 10 gm of salt consumption per day, the iodization level of salt could be around 15-30 mg per kg of salt. The impurities present in edible salt, moisture and temperature are some of the main factors that induce loss of iodine from iodized salt. In order of to deliver adequate amount of iodine to the consumer while avoiding the unnecessary excess addition of iodizing agent in salt that is normally done to compensate for losses, it is paramount importance that an ultrastable iodizing agent should be developed. This would allow a simultaneous benefit in as much as it may not be necessary to purify salt excessively as is the practice at present to minimize iodine loss apart from imparting a superior aesthetic effect such as free flow nature. The latter is especially important, as it is well known that impurities such as magnesium are required as micronutrient and can also enhance the saltiness of salt.</span></p> <P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify" align=justify>Bittern and soda ash are reacted to make magnesium precursor.

5 “CleanWrite” WRITING CHALK <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Chalk has been a traditional teaching aid in school, colleges and institutions. It is likely to continue to play critical role in education in our country, notwithstanding developments around information technology and erasable inks for white boards. It is typically manufactured by small-scale industries with little quality control or formal product specifications. Its requirement is estimated to exceed 100,000 ton per annum in the country, assuming 300 million people using chalk one way or the other.</p> <P class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify>We have developed calcium carbonate based superior quality extruded writing chalk having high bulk density, smooth finish, dust-free nature, ability to withstand easy breakage, negligible sensitivity towards moisture, good visibility of writing, and easy wiping. One such chalk piece can write as much as 3-4 regular chalk pieces.</P>

RO is a membrane separation process in which the sea-water/brackish-water permeates through a membrane by applying a pressure larger than the osmotic pressure of sea-water/brackish-water. The membrane is permeable for water, but not for the dissolved salts. In this way, a separation between a pure water fraction (the permeate) and a concentrated fraction (concentrate) is obtained. Pressures needed for the separation are in the range of 50 bars for sea-water, 20 bars for brackish-water. Most RO membranes are polymeric thin film composite(TFC) membranes, consisting of a very thin separating layer and a number of supporting layers with much lower resistance against mass transport. The membranes are usually configured in spiral-wound modules, where the sea-water/brackish-water flows between two flat membrane sheets wrapped around a central tube. The advantage of RO is the low cost of the product water which can be Rs. 22.5- 31.5/m<SUP>3</SUP>, compared to Rs.45.0 – 63.0/m<SUP>3</SUP> for MSF and MED, depending on energy cost. Energy consumption in RO is low compared to distillation processes, although pumping costs are still considerable.

8 Simultaneous production of liquid seaweed fertilizer and seaweed granules containing kappa carrageenan from Kappaphycus alvarezii <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In <place w:st="on"><country-region w:st="on">India</country-region></place>, brown seaweeds are represented mainly by <i>Sargassum spp</i>., which are found to be a good source of fertilizer because of the mineral and growth hormone content and can be used as compost also. Seaweed extracts are being sold in the international market under different trade names as foliar spray such as Sea sol, Maxi crop cytozyme, Sea spray, SM3, Cylex, Sea crop, Algit super, Algifert, Marinure, Geomore, Kelpak, Sea more, Algal Spray, etc. These extracts are produced from a variety of brown seaweeds like <i>Ascophyllum, Macrocytis, Laminaria, Ecklonia, Durvellea, Carpophyllum, </i>and<i> Sargassum</i>. Major bulk producers are USA Cytozyme, Maxicrop, Chase Organics, Marinure, Algistin and Glenorganic. In India SPIC Cytozyme, Chennai and a few companies in <place w:st="on">Gujarat</place> are producers of liquid seaweed fertilizer.</p>

<p align="justify"><span>The value of seaweed extract is not judged from its NPK value, but it is decided from the trace elements and growth promoting substances like cytokinins, auxins, gibberllins and other sugar compounds present in it. Seaweed extracts have been proved to have good effect on vegetables, fruits, cereals, and pulses with considerable increase in the quality and quantity of the product. Besides this, it acts as a frost and pest resistant and reduces flower and fruit dropout.</span></p> <P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify" align=justify>Seaweed, <I>Sargassum</I>, is collected from seacoast and thoroughly cleaned with fresh seawater to remove extraneous matter, sun dried before shifted to process house.

Next day morning mixture, it is filtered out and solid mass is cooked in hot water. Later on hot slurry is filtered out. The solid mass is once again cooked in alkaline medium and slurry is filtered. Filtrate in all the three steps is the product known as liquid seaweed fertilizer. Filtrate received after cooking is concentrated in the evaporator to reduce the volume. Later on it is mixed with the cold filtrate collected in the first step. The liquid product is stored in the storage vessel and then packed in the containers. To avoid bacterial and fungus growth in the liquid suitable preservatives are added in the final product.</SPAN></P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"></SPAN>

9 Integrated Process For The Recovery Of Salt & Marine Chemicals <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">India ranks third among the salt producing countries of the world with an annual production of 17.0 million tons per annum. The institute has developed and patented an innovative process for the recovery of high purity salt integrated with the recovery of marine chemicals. In the field of chemical technology, this invention relates to integrated recovery of salt and marine chemicals and to a method of preparing them. More particularly this invention relates to recovery of salt and marine chemicals from sub soil brine of <place w:st="on"></place>Gujarat and Rajasthan.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The preparation of inorganic salts and marine chemicals from sea brine has been known for sometimes. A naturally occurring sub-soil brine/sea brine<span>&nbsp; </span>containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na+, Cl<sup>-</sup> , SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> can be treated to produce common salt, calcium sulphate, potassium chloride, bromine, high purity magnesium chloride and magnesia in an integrated manner. The common salt apart from being an essential dietary component, it is a basic raw material for the manufacture of a wide variety of industrial chemicals viz. Sodium Carbonate (Soda ash), Sodium hydroxide (Caustic soda), and chlorine. Besides, salt is used in textile, dairy, dyeing, food, fertilizer, paper, and pharmaceutical industries. Marine gypsum is used in cement industries and in the preparation of high strength Plaster of Paris. It can also be used as a source of calcium in the preparation of calcium based siliceous chemicals. Magnesium compounds find applications in agriculture, refractories, pharmaceuticals, rubber, polymer additives and fire retardant. Potash is an essential plant nutrient and chemical grade KCl is used for making other important potash chemicals. </p> <P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify>A new process for recovery of common salt, potassium chloride, concentrated magnesium chloride with enriched bromide, and high purity magnesia from brine in an integrated manner.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The process comprises, desulphatation of brine with calcium chloride solution either produced in situ or distiller waste liquor containing calcium chloride, solar evaporation of desulphated brine, production of sodium chloride of superior quality in solar pans, solar evaporation of bittern thereby producing carnallite and end bittern, processing carnallite through established processes to produce Low sodium salt /Potassium chloride, producing end bittern containing highly concentrated magnesium chloride and enriched bromide and calcinations of such end bittern after solidification to produce high purity magnesia and hydrochloric acid utilizable. </P> Please contact: Director, CSMCRI, Bhavnagar, India A process for the recovery of common salt and marine chemicals from brine in integrated manner, US Patent No: 6,776,972 dated 17 August 2004 integ salt-1_1.jpg integ salt-1.jpg
10 Potassium Sulphate From Sulphate Rich Bittern <p align="justify"><span>SOP is a dual fertilizer containing 50% K<sub>2</sub>O and 18% S.<span>&nbsp; </span>It has the lowest salt index and is virtually free of chloride, which makes it a superior fertilizer to muriate of potash (MOP).<span>&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, MOP is easy to produce especially when brine/bittern is low in sulphate content such as in the <place w:st="on">Dead Sea</place> and this accounts for its lower price compared to SOP.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Countries such as <country-region w:st="on"><place w:st="on">India</place></country-region>, which do not have low sulphate bittern, but which have adequate bittern of sea and sub-soil origin, would be greatly benefited if SOP can be produced economically from such bittern sources. Besides its application as a fertilizer, potassium sulphate has numerous industrial applications as well.</span></p> <P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The invention relates to a novel integrated process for the recovery of sulphate of potash (SOP) from sulphate rich bittern. The process requires only bittern and lime as raw materials. Kainite mixed salt is obtained by fractional crystallization of the bittern. Kainite is converted into schoenite with simultaneous removal of NaCl in a single step and the filtrate (SEL) is used for production of muriate of potash (MOP).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The schoenite is reacted with MOP in presence of water to yield SOP and the filtrate (KEL) is recycled in the kainite to schoenite conversion step.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The production of MOP from SEL is carried out by desulphating the latter, which promotes carnallite formation.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Desulphatation is carried out with CaCl<SUB>2</SUB> generated from the reaction of carnallite decomposed liquor with hydrated lime. The by-product magnesium hydroxide can be converted into caustic calcined magnesia with &gt;95% purity and B<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> impurity content less than 0.03%.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>Gypsum and NaCl are the other products obtained in the process.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Utilisation of all effluent and intermediate streams allow for an overall SOP yield &gt;90% w.r.t. the potash content in the mixed salt.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>These together with the production of valuable co-products make the process economically viable.</SPAN></P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">

0000000001 Office Memorandum 2005-12-09 No. EPABX/2005 telephone facilitiees <div id="Text_Dyanmic">
<P>All the staff members are aware that a new Telephone Exchange has been installed in CSMCRI a couple of months ago. Since then although the system has been working quite satisfactorily, a need has been felt that there should be improved facilities for communicating outside the Institute for official purposes.&nbsp; Director after considering all issues had decided as follows so as to enable staff to make official calls as and when needed.</P>
<P>(1) Private Secretaries of all the Discipline Coordinators have been provided with a phone with STD facility. Staff members working in the discipline can make external calls for official purposes from this phone after making necessary entries in the register kept for this purpose.<br />
(2) Second in command i.e. next to DC in the discipline will also be provided a telephone with STD facility. Staff in the discipline can also call from this phone after following the above procedure<br />
(3) Staff members can also avail the services of Receptionist (Mrs. Meena Mehta) to make any external calls for official purposes. Mrs. Mehta will connect the desired number and then forward the call to the concerned Scientist and she will maintain a register of STD calls made. The caller will be required to sign the Register in token of having made the call.<br />
(4) ISD calls can only be made from Director's office.<br />
(5) In addition to the above local dialing facilities will be provided at select locations, which may be accessed by all staff who need to make official calls.(list enclosed)<br />
The above facilities are being introduced on experimental basis. Their continuance are otherwise will be reviewed after four months depending upon the quantum of expenditure burden on the Institute on account of increased facilities.<br />
