1 Tax Seminar Over the last few years and particularly since the advent of the 50% tax rate, interest in utilising legal methods to reduce personal tax liabilities has grown significantly.

For instance a Company Director earning in excess of &pound;50,000 per year could retain up to 80&percent; of their earnings, whilst the company could reduce payroll costs by in excess of 13% and receive full tax relief on the expenditure!

So how can it be done?

If you earn (by salary and/or dividends) &pound;50,000 or more per annum and/or
You have individual employees earning &pound;50,000 or more per annum

If you would like to learn how to achieve these savings you should attend the "Keeping What You Earn!" breakfast event being hosted by Crombies on Wednesday 2nd February at The Mount Hotel & Conference Centre, Mount Road, Tettenhall Wood, Wolverhampton, WV6 8HL. 

Registration for this FREE event will be from 8.00am for the seminar which will run from 8.30am until 10.30am. 

This presentation will introduce you to the development and registration of the tax strategies, how their implementation is handled and how any H M Revenue & Customs queries are dealt with.

Then once you have an understanding of this type of planning you will be introduced to the strategies to be taken advantage of immediately to significantly mitigate your tax liability.
You will benefit from this presentation if you can answer yes to any of the following:
&middot; You're a company director with income of &pound;50,000 or more 
&middot; You have employees or external contractors with income in excess of &pound;50,000 
&middot; Your company profits are in excess of &pound;100,000 per annum 
&middot; You utilise contractors or are a contractor with earnings in excess of &pound;50,000 
&middot; You have employee groups earning &pound;40,000 or more per annum each 
Key members of our tax support team will be available directly after the seminar for one to one discussions on your own personal circumstances giving you the chance to maximise your time by tailoring what you've learnt to your circumstances.

7 Iron Butt Rally <p>On Thursday 16th June 2011 our very own John Young (Director), will be taking part in The Iron Butt Rally held in the United States. The rally consists of five checkpoints located around the perimeter of the United States, in order to be considered a finisher the riders must be present at each of these checkpoints within a two hour window. No consideration is given for bad weather, riders can expect to ride through severe thunderstorms, hurricanes and the occasional tornado. Temperature extremes routinely run 125 degrees or more in the desert Southwest, in living up to the name &#39;Worlds Toughest Motorcycle Competition&#39;, event organizers intentionally route the rally through such places as Death Valley or the Mojave Desert during the hottest part of the day, to extreme cold at the top of mountains like Pike&#39;s Peak in Colorado. We will be posting updates on John&#39;s progression through his gruelling journey on the Crombies Blog, so please show your support and follow his success.</p> live <p>On Thursday 16th June 2011 our very own John Young (Director), will be taking part in The Iron Butt Rally held in the United States.</p> images/ironbuttrally.jpg <p>On Thursday 16th June 2011 our very own John Young (Director), will be taking part in The Iron Butt Rally held in the United States.</p> 16th June 2011 2011-08-01 15:50:26

<h3 style="color:#990000;">Capital Gains Tax Planning </h3>
          <p>Capital Gains Tax is payable to the Inland Revenue when an individual or company sells or transfers an asset to someone else. You only have to pay Capital Gains Tax on disposing of an asset if you have made a chargeable gain. Typically, you make a gain if the asset is worth more than it was when you acquired it.<br />
            <br />
            The rate of Capital Gains Tax depends on your circumstances. In general terms, you pay tax at whatever your highest rate of tax is. Crombies will assist in the complicated and detailed calculations required in order to conclude how much Capital Gains Tax is payable on a disposal. If you are shortly due to make a disposal of an asset which you think may attract capital gains tax, please speak with us about how this tax may be mitigated.<br />

<p>I believe that by not graduating from a multi-national practice like many other practice leaders in other accountancy firms, I can relate to the ambitions and frustrations of entrepreneurial owner-managers having successfully tackled the same challenges in my own business over the last decade.</p>

<p>My areas of specialism are tax planning for owner managed businesses including profit extraction planning, share valuations and profit improvement using One Page Plans.</p>

<p><strong>When I&rsquo;m not at work</strong>: I am a keen sportsman, regularly playing tennis as a member of Wolverhampton Lawn Tennis &amp; Squash Club, golf at wherever they will allow me and football, (which tends to be more as a spectator these days) with my wife Karen and sons Ross &amp; Alex in the family enclosure at Molineux.&nbsp; I am also a member of Shifnal Round Table.</p> partner 15 2015-08-04 00:00:00

You only have to pay Capital Gains Tax on disposing of an asset if you have made a chargeable gain. Typically, you make a gain if the asset is worth more than it was when you acquired it.</span><br style="color: rgb(113, 113, 113); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" />

<span style="color: rgb(113, 113, 113); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The rate of Capital Gains Tax depends on your circumstances. In general terms, you pay tax at whatever your highest rate of tax is. Crombies will assist in the complicated and detailed calculations required in order to conclude how much Capital Gains Tax is payable on a disposal. If you are shortly due to make a disposal of an asset which you think may attract capital gains&nbsp;</span><a href="http://orologivip.com/Categorie/patek-philippe/">patek philippe replica</a><span style="color: rgb(113, 113, 113); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;"> tax, please speak with us about how this tax may be mitigated.</span></p>
