1 Welcome to Barnstaple Swimming Club FALSE Barnstaple swimming club was formed 74 years ago and celebrates its 75th year next year.  As the first swim 21 accredited club at teaching and Skill Development levels in N.Devon. We provide a whole range of Aquatic pursuits open to children and Adults from the North Devon area and beyond, if you are prepared to travel.
<br><Br>
We currently have approximately 550 members who all tap into the various water based activities that are the basis of Barnstaple ASC.  We are non-profit-making club run by volunteers, all the fees and sponsorship we take in are ploughed back to the club.
<br><br>
Barnstaple Swimming Club aims to provide an opportunity to swim and through competitions and regular training help swimmers to achieve their personal goals.
<br><br>
Come along to one of our training sessions - click the button on the right to view our session schedule.
<br><br>
If you have any queries or questions regarding the club please click on the contact us menu option and either call us or complete the enquiry/comment form.
2 Learn to Swim FALSE Youngsters who want to learn to swim can join our learn to swim programme which is held on Thursday Nights at Barnstaple Leisure centre. 
<br><br>
We follow the Amateur Swimming Associations national Plan for Teaching Swimming which is a modular programme that teaches children to achieve a range of swimming and water based skills across a number of levels.
Each level has 10 skills that need to be learned, once the swimmer is assessed as competent with these skills they are able to move onto the next level, our learn to swim programme covers levels 1--8 of the national plan for teaching swimming.
<br><br>
So that you are able to see what your child is meant to achieve in each section I have attached links to each stage below.
<br><br>
Once the swimming teacher for each level feels that the swimmer is competent across all skills in a level, they will request an assessment from a second level 2 teacher to verify whether the swimmer is ready to move to the next section.<br><br>
A Certificate of competency will be awarded at the end of the level also ASA sew on patches with official ASA certificates will be available for purchase once the standard is achieved.
<br><br>

3 Squads FALSE <b>Pre-Squad Seals, Sharks and Marlins</b><br><br>
Once your child has reached Level 8 of the National Plan for teaching swimming they will be ready to enter Pre squad sessions which are held in the lanes at the deep end of the pool on Tues, Thurs and Sunday Evenings.<br><Br>
The pre squad is divided into 3 groups known as Seals, Sharks and Marlins, within these groups the emphasis is on completing levels 9-12 of the national plan for teaching swimming and is an introduction to training and competition, swimmers at this level will be encouraged to compete in the Annual Club Championships and may be selected to represent the club at mini league and inter club galas.
<Br><br>  
      
<b>Junior Squad</b><br><Br>
Designed for junior swimmers within the club who wish to learn how to train for competition and would be expected to represent the club when selected at County, District and National level.
Junior squad members would be expected to commit to a training program that would involve training 3 times per week minimum. Emphasis would be on learning to train and building of base aerobic fitness and improvement on skills base. Introduction of principles such as warming up, stretching, swimming down, nutrition and dietary requirements of a swimmer would also be included
<br><Br> 
<b>The County Development Squad</b><br><br>

Designed for swimmers who wish to train, but are not willing to commit to the criteria or are ineligible for consideration for the District National Squad. Senior Squad members are expected to complete a minimum of 3 sessions per week, will follow a competition based program for the year and would be expected to represent the club at all times when selected. Swimmers would also be expected to compete at County, District and National competitions if qualifying times were achieved. This squad has 5 sessions available to it Sun, Tues and Thursday evenings and Tues or Thursday mornings

<br><Br>  
  
<b>District National Squad</b><br><Br>
4 Competitions FALSE The program at Barnstaple for the competitive swim squads is built around certain competitions throughout the year. <ul><li>The Age group swimmers will train over 2 main cycles each year ending in a competition at County, District or National level.</li><li> The Youth / Senior swimmers train over 3 cycles, again ending in competitions, a level 1 designated meet, District youth champs and the National Youth championships.</li></ul>
<p>
To compete at these events swimmers must achieve qualifying times as shown below.
<br><br>
    
<b>Speedo League</b><br><br>

The Speedo league is a national competition that is run over 3 weekends in October, November and December each year. The country is split into 7 regions and each region has a number of divisions dependent on the amount of swimming clubs in the area,  In The west we have the premier league and divisions 1-3.<br><br>
The top eight teams in each division go through to the final gala in December, winners of this competition become divisional champs for that year and if not in the premier league then would be promoted to the next division along with the second paled club, the bottom 2 clubs are relegated to the division below.<br><br>

Premier league winners go through to a national final held in April normally at Ponds Forge International Pool in Sheffield.<br><br>

Barnstaple, after having many years in the lower divisions, finally joined the elite of the West this year when they gained promotion to the Western premier league which will enable them next year to compete against the likes of Plymouth Leander, Millfield School, Exeter City and Kelly College.
<br><br>
<b>Devon Interclub </b><br><br>
This gala is usually held at the end of January at Plymouths Central Park pool and comprises of a number of individual events but has mixed relays with 2 boys and 2 girls from each age group.
It is an opportunity for the club to pitch itself against all of the other swimming clubs in Devon and is always an exciting gala with lots of noise and a fantastic atmosphere.

your swimming as well as variety. Famously Matt Biondi played water 
polo and swam for the USA being the first swimmer to break 49 sec for 
100m, winning 1 gold medal at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984, five at 
the Seoul Olympics in 1988 and two at Barcelona in 1992.<br><Br>

3 Speedo Success for Barnstaple FALSE 1 Barnstaple swimming club capped a tremendous year in the Speedo League as their talented young squad secured promotion in the Premier Division for 2007.<br><br>
Next year Barnstaple will be among the top 18 swimming clubs in the South West and South Wales for the first time in their history after a gallant team effort at Bath cemented runners-up spot in Division 1.<br><Br>
There was an electric atmosphere at the University Olympic pool where the North Devon club battled for the two promotion places with rivals Pembrokeshire Aces and City of Newport.
And after a two horse race for top spot, Newport eventually took Barnstaple who finished a commending 63 points in front of third placed Pembrokeshire.<br><br>
The Barnstaple squad may have been feeling the effects of a tough series of club championships in the past three weeks, but they pulled out all the stops to claim 12 first places.<br><br>
Spurred on by their travelling support the team recorded a clutch of personal bests and the relay teams were in fine form, winning seven of the 16 races.
Congratulations to everyone who competed in the Speedo League this year, and we look forward to our new challenges in the Premier League next year.

57 WHINFELL DESIREE This mare joined the herd at the beginning of 2006. I do not usually buy horses over the phone, however she is the only filly out of our old favorite LONGBRIDGE DEBUTANTE and when she came on the market right in the middle of foaling I did not have time to go to Cumbria to see her.

 Known as FLOPSY at home she stands 16hh and has been shown under saddle in Riding Horse classes and this year produced a stunning liver chesnut colt by KILVINGTON SCOUNDREL which we are retaining.

'Aggie' has been with us for a number of years now and produced some high class young horses including Astonish and Streetwise - both County Champions by Daws Firebird.This year ASTONISH commenced his ridden career and has already qualified for Burghley in the Young Event Horse Final

Aggie is a beautifully made, small hunter mare who has been a prolific winner herself in the showring with many, many county championships to her credit.

We have retained a 2004 filly out of her by the high class 14.2hh sire KILVINGTON SCOUNDREL. She did not breed in 2005 and is not in foal for 2006.

Lucky produced a filly by Bandmaster in 2004 and fillies by Lord Of The Dance in 2005 and 2006 (see For Sale page). She is due to the exciting young Jumbo son Brief Encounter in 07

59 MASTER BALLINGLEN I am delighted to offer for sale a very special 2 year old - bred in the purple to event and with the looks, limbs and movement to succeed in a number of disciplines.

JAMES was originally purchased from GORESBRIDGE as a foal and has been in the UK ever since. He is by the Irish TB MASTER IMP who has made his mark aS one of the leading sires of event and show horses in England and Ireland. From Dublin/HOYS Champions to high class Advanced Event Horses - there are literally dozens of top class horses by MASTER IMP - some of the leading eventers in England alone include THE MASTER'S LADY, MASTER EXCHANGE, IMPERIAL MASTER and KING GEORGE to name just a few.

His dam BALLINGLEN SUSIE has been approved as one of Southern Ireland's PREMIER mares. She is by KILDALTON KING who is a son of the world famous KING OF DIAMONDS.

JAMES currently stands just over 16hh and should mature between 16.2 and 16.3hh, he couples super limbs with straight,free movement and a lovely temperament.

Whilst he has enormous potential in many disciplines my preferance would be to sell JAMES to a serious eventing home where he will be prepared for the BYEH series. SOLD SOLD jamesright.jpg jamestrotting.jpg default.jpg default.jpg default.jpg default.jpg default.jpg default.jpg FALSE FOR SALE

18 2004-08-09 Nancy had been busy all winter with the 4yr old <b>Broadstone After Hours</b>, preparing her for the SEIB Young Horse Evaluation and she contested her 1st qualifier in the showjumping section at Tall Trees. The mare performed brilliantly, her loose jumping was spectacular and she went very well under saddle, jumping everything despite having never seen such big fences. She won the section and scoring the highest marks of the day and indeed the series and was awarded an Elite Mare Diploma. We decided then to aim for the final at The Royal Show before turning her away for a well earned summer holiday.
 
The show season has been, expensive, tiring and very rewarding with some decent results. Nancy did a star turn at The Royal to finish 2nd in the show jumping final with <b>After Hours</b> and Viv an equally brilliant job with Astonish to take the Hunter Championship, Queens Cup and Cuddy Reserve at Royal Cornwall. <b>Barbie</b> then justified our faith in her by taking the Mare Championship at Royal Welsh - her second show - in some very strong company.
 
Numbers seem to have swelled over the last couple of years and as the broodmarees are part of the family we have decided to sell a a coiuple of youngsters. byhe.jpg
35 2007-03-28 Well for me 2006 was the year of bruises! the season started really well when all 3 youngsters won their respective classes at Devon County and the yearling Rubie Tuesday (ex Lucky Harvest) was Reserve Champion.

Bath & West proved successful too. Ramona won the 3 yr old fillies, Ilena was 2nd in a strong Hack/Riding Horse Mixed mare class and Malarki was Champion Sport Horse for Penny

Unfortunately a few days before Royal Cornwall Turbo knocked me over (by accident) and then cantered over the top of me to get to her friends at the top of the field. Four hospital visits later they finally decided my leg was not broken. However - stubborn as always - I ignored all sensible advice to stay at home with it elevated and continued to go to work. Consequently my leg (already black from toes to the knee) swelled and ulcerated. Still I did not listen and we took horses to Royal Cornwall where Rubie and Ilena both won their classes and Irish was 2nd in her class. 

This success was all due to friends who rallied round, drove the lorry and showed the horses-thank you.

By the time we got to 3 counties I had decided in my wisdom that I was fit to show! Halfway through the 3 yr old class I ended up handing Ramona over to a friend - who duly won the class and then took Reserve Champion. 

Still not prepared to give up I took Ilena in to her class which she duly won, as did her foal. However that really was a bridge too far and that was me knackered and home for the last of the county shows inc The Royal and Great Yorkshire

One final fling was to take Irish (Grafton Street) to The National Hunter Show where she won a good class shown beautifully by Lesley Wilmington.Unbelievably I had been kicked in the arm just a couple of weeks before and was completely useless!

So once again - a fairly low key season for us but a pleasing set of results. Hi-light for me was not the show but Gizmo-our black and tan terrier-producing 6 bonnie pups in July. Predictably one has remained.....the runt...Daisy! The rest have all gone to horsey homes and I must say parting with them was worse than selling any horse! default.jpg
21 2004-08-17 It has been great to see horses we have sold out flying the flag for us this season.
 
Sue & Graham Phillips have been going great guns with the 2 yr old filly <b>SHOW ME HEAVEN</b> - Champion at Cheltenham, R Champion in both hunters and sport horses at Kent County and a class winner at New Forest.
 
Another LORD OF THE DANCE offspring <b>ILLUSION</b> has been very consistent all season in Sport Horse classes at conty level and won his class at New Forest and has been in the top three on almost every outing.
 
His half brother out of the same mare <b>AQUILAS BLACK EAGLE</b> has won 4 of his 5 classes, already taking Championships, no mean feat for a yearling. His half brother - the black colt foal <b>ELUSIVE</b> is on this site for sale and we think he is a top class Riding Horse prospect.
 
<b>TEXAS TWOSTEP</b> - sold to Nicki Elstow last year carrying a Matinee foal was Champion at Wincanton and R Champion at Kent County and her foal was Supreme Champion foal at Midlands. Yet again <b>AGINCOURT's</b> siblings continue to make their mark.
 
Finally <b>STORMHILL MICHAEL</b> sold to Mary Gordon-Watson has just qualified at Gatcombe for the Burghley Young Event horse final - Good Luck to them. default.jpg
26 2004-09-29 The British Show, Hack, Cob & Riding Horse National Championships rounded off our 2004 show season.

The long journey seemed very worthwhile when our Small Riding Horse mare won a strong broodmare class and her foal then followed suit. Lorraine Ahmet had done a beautiful job of producing the Bandmaster yearling out of her (and sold to her as a foal)he duly won his class too. We felt very proud when Ilena then went Champion, her yearling Reserve and her foal Reserve Reserve.

Ilena then went on to take a hotly contested Supreme and the yearling was adjudjed overall Youngstock Champion and her foal reserve Champion Owner bred.

It was a lovely end to another lovely season. default.jpg
30 2004-11-11 The 2004 crop of foals have all left us now to start their new lives and we would like to take this opportunity to wish the purchasers EVERY success with them.

Numbers seemed much reduced (for 5 minutes) until some Irish 4 legged visitors joined us temporarily. Needless to say one has remained. Emma, Marg & I have bought a ches filly (Yes thats right) to run with the Kilvington Scoundrel filly we are keeping.

Last weekend Anne Ratcliffe from Stormhill Stud arrived with equine friends en masse from Spain with some super ones to sell inc a showjumping schoolmistress, a smart young event mare and a smart 4 yr old 1/2 sister to Stormhill Michael.
No doubt we will get some info on the site asap meanwhile have a look at www.stormhillstud.co.uk
...the sale horses are now in Barnstaple ...its a lot closer than Seville. default.jpg
34 2006-02-11 2005 was a pretty low key year for us with far fewer shows than usual. That said MALARKI flew the flag well, taking Championships at both Royal Cornwall and Three Counties. He has now been sold to Penny Unwin and we wish them every success in 2006 - we look forward to seeing you at the shows.

Broadstone After Hours won the Performance class at Malvern in September-having just won four British Novices and a Discovery - one after another, she was subsequently sold to a competition home. default.jpg

20 "Every full double-decker school bus at the end of the day is likely to be taking home around 7 seriously unhappy children. Most of the lower deck would at some time during their childhood have been going home to serious worries. Approximately 10 children may be going home to a 'double-shift' of cleaning, laundry, shopping and preparing meals, and 2 or 3 will be in fear of violence between their parents another two or three will be returning to a life of regular beatings or denigration."

(Cawson et al. (2000) Child maltreatment in the United Kingdom: a study of the prevalence of child abuse and neglect..)


The frequency of child abuse in a country is usually derived from prevalence or incidence studies:

Prevalence of child abuse refers to the proportion of the defined population who have been abused during a specified time period - usually childhood (i.e. 0-18)


Incidence refers to the number of new cases occurring in a defined child population over a year.
There are four key types of maltreatment: physical, sexual and emotional abuse, and neglect.

The NSPCC's Child Maltreatment study (Cawson et al, 2000) of the prevalence of maltreatment and harm that children experience provides an essential starting point in defining the scale of maltreatment. It is the first such study of the general population, involving nearly 3,000 young adults (aged 18-24), to be carried out in the UK. It found that:


7% of children experienced serious physical abuse at the hands of their parents or carers during childhood.

1% of children aged under 16 experienced sexual abuse by a parent or carer and a further 

3% by another relative during childhood.

11% of children experienced sexual abuse by people known but unrelated to them.

5% of children experienced sexual abuse by an adult stranger or someone they had just met

6% of children experienced serious absence of care at home during childhood

5% of children experienced serious absence of supervision during childhood

6% of children experienced frequent and severe emotional maltreatment  during childhood.

<i>(Cawson et al. (2000) Child maltreatment in the United Kingdom: a study of the prevalence of child abuse and neglect. London: NSPCC. p.70)</i>

16% of children (1 in 6) experienced serious maltreatment by parents, of whom one third experienced more than one type of maltreatment . The study found that 'both parents were equally likely to be involved in maltreatment [physical abuse, emotional abuse and neglect], with the exception of sexual abuse'. 

<i>(Cawson (2002) Child maltreatment in the family: the experience of a national sample of young people. London: NSPCC. p.5 and 26)</i> Current Abuse Statistics FALSE MVC-010F.JPG.jpg Understanding abuse
21 <b>1. Child abuse is a rare occurrence.</b>

At least one child in ten is at some point in childhood, judged to be at risk of significant harm, and likely to be suffering from physical, emotional, sexual, or other forms of abuse and neglect

<b>2. Abuse and neglect almost always occurs in poor, minority, and/or inner-city families.</b>

Child abuse is relentlessly democratic. It occurs within every neighbourhood and school community across the country.

<b>3. Sexual assault only happens to girls.</b>

Boys tend not to report such events. Current research estimates that one of four girls and one of four to seven boys will experience some form of sexual assault before their eighteenth birthday.

<b>4.  Most assaults on children are perpetrated by a stranger.</b>

90% of child sexual assaults are perpetrated by an adult who is known and trusted by the child.

<b>5. Child abusers are easy to identify.</b>

Child abusers cannot be easily distinguished from other people. They are not usually people with mental illness or disabilities. In fact, many offenders are upstanding community citizens.

<b>6. Most abused children do something to cause the abuse.</b>

The child is always the victim. The responsibility for the abuse lies solely with the adult. Over half of the adult survivors say they told no-one because they were too frightened, guilty, or felt they wouldn't be believed.

<b>7. Child abuse is the problem of organizations such as the police, government and social services.</b>

Safegurading children and young people is the responsibility of every individual. We need courage unity to tackle this problem together. The Myths of Child Abuse FALSE devoncap-workshop.jpg Understanding abuse
22 <i>Most abuse is committed by people that children know and trust</i>
Childhood Matters: report of the National Inquiry into the Prevention of Child Abuse (1996)

Statistics help us understand the incidence and potential of abuse. But statistics provide an indication of the occurrence of abuse, they are not definitive, statistics are always going to be the tip of the iceberg. So much happens that we dont see, that isnt reported, so much is left unspoken.  

We must recognize the myths and stereotypes of abuse and realize that abuse happens across all social stratas, all races, and is not gender dependant. 

We must face up to the fact that abuse is happening. Lets not turn away, lets not be scared, we can work together to tackle this issue.

The newspaper and television are full of stories of terrible things that happen to children.  It can be very difficult for parents to get a balanced view on how they protect their children.  Historically the messages we have been given are about protecting our children from strangers, yet the risk of our children being hurt by strangers is very small.  Our children are at greater risk at home, from people in their family and wider circle.

There is very little information out there for parents on how to discuss these issues with their children. Parents are rightly concerned with protecting their childrens innocence and not making them fearful.  The CAP project is committed to helping communities to give children positive messages and provide the information and tools they need to keep themselves safe.

Look in our Resources and Links page for more information on how you can contribute to the safety of children and young people. Working together to prevent abuse FALSE MVC-010F.JPG.jpg Understanding abuse
23 Our aim is to ensure that every child has the chance to fulfil their potential by reducing levels of educational failure, ill health, substance misuse, teenage pregnancy, abuse and neglect, crime and anti-social behaviour among children and young people. Every Child Matters, Green Paper, 2003

The Every Child Matters green paper came as a response to Lord Lamings Inquiry into the tragic death of Victoria Climbié which exposed shameful failings in our ability to protect the most vulnerable children.  The Green Paper identified five outcomes which matter most to children and young people:

	being healthy;
	staying safe;
	enjoying and achieving;
	making a positive contribution;
	economic well-being.

It highlighted better information sharing as key to successful early intervention to help children who require additional support to achieve those outcomes.

CAP is committed to helping the government achieve these targets, by helping children stay safe, to enjoy their childhood and achieve their potential.

3 <B>Welcome to CAP, the Child Assault Prevention Project. 

Our aim is to reduce all childrens vulnerability to abuse.</b>

CAPs school based assault prevention programmes offer education, guidance and support by giving children positive messages on how they can protect themselves. We work with the whole school community - children, parents/carers and staff, to build on childrens strengths and empower them.

Our workshops provide children with the ability to recognize unsafe situations and the confidence to act on them, so that they can <b>stay safe, strong and free.</b>

In the last ten years CAP has worked with over 70% of schools in South Devon and 14 schools within South Somerset. We've reached over 55,000 children, young people, their parents/carers and schools staff giving them the skills and strategies to prevent abuse.

It has been an exciting time for CAP, in 2005 we launched three new projects:

17 <i>"I wish I'd had this when I was young. I might not have suffered so much."</i>

CAP takes a fresh approach  to assault prevention,  aiming to reduce fear by focusing on what children can do, rather than on what they cant.

When we teach a child how to cross a road, we focus on how they should cross a road safely, not on the graphic details of a road accident. When we teach children how to swim, we do not focus on drowning.   In the same way, the CAP project takes a fresh approach to actual or potential assault situations by focusing on a childs rights and the postive action they can take in unsafe situations. 

Our workshops are designed to build childrens confidence and self esteem, and are lively and fun. Children learn through drama and discussion with trained facilitators, about their rights to safety, strength and freedom.  We encourage them to be proud of these rights and to respect the rights of others. Through the workshops they learn that they have the ability to protect themselves in unsafe situations. They learn they have a right to say no, and are encouraged to talk to somebody they trust.  The issues we tackle are: childrens safety with peers, strangers and familiar adults. 

The workshops are delivered in a curriculum appropriate way, according to the age and understanding of the children . Very young children use puppets with more repetition and music; the older children have a chance to explore the concepts in greater depth and problem solve the enacted situations. 

CAP is unique because of our community approach. We believe the whole community can take responsibility for the protection of its children and young people, but this cannot be done without the involvement of the children themselves. This is not to say that children and young people are responsible for protecting themselves, that is adults responsibility.  However, as abuse is surrounded by secrecy and threats, a way in has to be through the children.

Before we work with the children, we work with parents/carers and school staff, to help them understand our approach and inform them of ways that they can contribute to the prevention of abuse.

6 As a registered charity, CAP is entirely dependent on grants from public and statutory bodies as well as donations from the general public. CAP does not have a fundraising or advertising budget - all our funds go directly towards helping children.

In the past people have climbed Ben Nevis, run the London Marathon and motorcycled from Jon O Groats to Lands End; Schools have held Mufty Days (non-uniform) and raised vital money for our work. 

Please get in touch if you would like to run a event, donate regulary to the project or if a business have resources to give. 

A regular donation of £10 a month will help the project reach children and young people and reduce their vulnerability to abuse. Give us a call.

5 A specially designed game for young children as a first experience of tennis, it uses a small court, special low bounce, larger balls and appropriate sized rackets.  This allows emphasis on movement and co-ordination and lets children learn the basic strokes and rules whilst having lots of fun.   Some clubs are LTA accredited Mini Tennis Centres.  This simply means that they fulfil certain criteria so that there is a standard of provision across the Country.

1 Playing Competitively The competitive structure can seem to be very complicated.  In terms of which events to enter, your coach should be able to advise you.  Local tournament information and entry forms are posted on the Devon website usually in September and March (<a href ="http://www.devon.totaltennis.net" target="_blank">www.devon.totaltennis.net</a>) and all sanctioned tournaments can be found on the LTA website <a href="http://www.lta.org.uk/GetOnCourt/Tournaments/" target="_blank">www.lta.org.uk/GetOnCourt/Tournaments</a> 

<b>Mini Tennis Circuits</b>

These are designed for the young novice player just starting to play competitively.  Players do not need to have a rating or be LTA members.  The circuits vary slightly each season as we attempt to cater for demand.  In general there is a green ball circuit and a yellow ball circuit, entries limited by age with a Masters final at the end of each season.  We also run a 13 & Under circuit for the older novice player.

<b>Matchplays and Tournaments</b>

There is a programme of matchplay events in both the winter and summer throughout Cornwall, Devon and Somerset .  These are co-ordinated by the County but run locally by clubs.  Though these are for rated players they are designed to give competitive opportunities to the first 3 ratings divisions (10s 9s and 8s), those first starting out, club players or improvers.

Running alongside these are the Ariel Winter Indoor County Matchplays.  These are age group events and in some cases act as qualifiers for the next level of competition, the Ariel Winter Indoor Series.

Some of the Club Matchplays now act as qualifiers for selected Ariel Winter County Indoor events and some of those are qualifiers for the next level, the Ariel Indoor Series.  

<b>Venues</b> 

There are no real rules regarding choosing venues except that certain LTA events require a performance surface such as indoor acrylic.  On a County level events are held where there is court space and/or an organiser/referee.  

<b>Officials</b> 

Referees at LTA sanctioned events are qualified and members of ABTO (Association of British Tennis Officials). 

<b>Umpires</b> 

Though it would be preferable to have umpires at finals unfortunately it is not really practicable.  Not only is there a cost implication, but there quite simply are not enough qualified umpires out  there.  Any one want to volunteer? default.jpg FALSE 1
2 Representing the County - Inter County Cups / County Training <b>Cups</b>

There are annual Inter County Cups in the following age categories:
	 
Event	Composition of Teams	Duration	Located	Time of Year
10 & Under	3 boys / 3 girls	2 days	South West area	May /June
12 & Under	3 boys / 3 girls	2 days	South West area	May /June
14 & Under	4 boys / 4 girls	3 days	Anywhere in GB	1st w/e May
18 & Under	6 boys /6 girls	3 days	Anywhere in GB	February

At 14 & Under and 18 & Under, counties are organised in ranked groups of 4 or 5.  The winners of each group are promoted to the next, the losers are demoted.  

<b>County Training</b>

The County has always felt that County Training should not have any impact or influence on a players individual programme with their own coach, rather, it should be seen as an additional benefit in that it gives players the opportunity to train with others of a similar standard. HIstorically then, County Training was designed to prepare teams for the County Cups working on tactics and doubles pairings/play.  In the period leading up to a Cup a squad of players attended 3 to 4 training sessions from which the eventual team was selected.  

Obviously, as the Inter County Cup teams are so small, only a handful of players could be offered the opportunity to be involved at County level.

From September 2006 the County will be implementing a new strategy, the Devon Junior County Player Plan.  The plan is quite straightforward and has been designed to meet the following goals:
Open the door to more players
Create a county player pathway
Simplify the selection process
Better prepare our County Cup teams

In order to offer far more opportunities for juniors to become part of County Tennis, we will be looking to invite up to a maximum of 48 10/U players into a special one2watch programme.  This forms the first tier of our new structure and will enable us to identify and encourage budding new talent.  Then at 12/U, 14/U and 18/U we will select up to 32 players (ideally 16 boys and 16 girls) in each age group to form County Squads.  The emphasis in these squads will be on doubles competitive play rather than training which should be provided by players individual programmes.   

The County Player Plan for these players will be made up of the following elements:

·	4 x County Squad Doubles Ranking events
·	1 x County Squad Friendly Match
·	2  3 County Cup Teambuilding Sessions
·	1 x per age group National Inter County Cup Competition
·	Devon Junior County Closed Championships

The Doubles Ranking events will focus on doubles matchplay in preparation for the Inter County Cup Competitions where doubles plays a crucial part.  From these competitive sessions we will be looking to give each player a County doubles ranking which will form part of our County Cup team selection process.  

The selection process for squads and teams is as follows:

1.	Winter County squads selected on LTA Rating/Rankings directly after the Junior County Closed Championships
2.	County squad doubles ranking sessions  players results correlated to give Devon County doubles ranking
3.	County Cup Teams selected based on LTA singles rating/Rankings & Devon County doubles rankings


<b>Selection for County Cup Teams</b>

Historically players were nominated by coaches and brought together to play off in front of County Coaches, much like football or hockey trials.  A do or die situation which for an individual sport like tennis, may not necessarily be a true reflection of a players ability.   

We hope our Devon Junior County Player Plan as explained under 'County Training'  will make the whole process more open and accessble. 

However, the advice to parents would still be to get out there competing at whatever level your child is comfortable with.  Remember, there are opportunities to compete at club level in the National Junior Club League and the Road to Wimbledon as well as at school in the Nestlé Schools Tennis leagues (year 8 and10) and in Mini Tennis events at primary schools. The NJCL and Nestlé are team competitions.  So if your club or school does not take part, maybe some encouragement from you could persuade them!

<b>Venues</b>

County Training and County events are normally held at the indoor County Centres  East Devon Tennis Centre, South Devon Tennis Centre, Tarka Tennis Centre and Exeter Tennis Centre.  This ensures that sessions are not at the mercy of the weather and also these are centres at which the County has been able to negotiate favourable court hire rates.  The County has to pay for courts and coaches.

<b>Tennis Camps in the holidays</b>

Most of the venues above as well as many clubs put on tennis camps and courses during the holidays.  However as the summer is the prime competition period with many local events to choose from, the County would encourage players to gain valuable experience through competing. default.jpg FALSE 2
3 Ratings Ratings need to be viewed as a tool which allows a player to get an idea of their ability compared to other players.  It is a means to an end and not the end in itself.  Players under 10 cannot be rated however this rule is being amended and at the moment, players who turn 10 in 2006 can apply for an LTA membership and from October 2005 and will be given a 10.2 rating to enable them to enter events prior to Christmas.  It currently costs £3 to get an LTA player membership and thereby a rating.  In order to enter most events you need to be a member of the LTA and have a rating.  To improve a rating for those rated 10.1 or 10.2 a player needs to record 4 singles wins against a player with any rating at all.  Simply record your 4 wins on a result card and send it in to the LTA Ratings Department (address on the card).  Once you reach a rating of 9.2 you need to be consistently beating players of the same or higher rating in order for your rating to go up.  Junior ratings cannot go down.

The organisers of official LTA tournaments (the ones published on the LTA website tournament page) automatically send in results.  Outside of this you can submit results on a national ratings score card.

The change in the LTAs philosophy towards Long Term Player Development and the recently revised rating system has not yet completely been reflected in the competition structure where acceptance into events is still in many cases determined by rating.  The whole situation is under review at the moment.

For more information <a href="http://www.lta.org.uk/playandcompete/competitiveplay/ratingsandrankings/aboutratings/" target="_blank">click here</a>. default.jpg FALSE 3
4 Rankings Players progressing through the competitive structure will now also be ranked and will earn ranking points through their results in certain events. Rankings operate in the 18U, 16U, 14U and 12U age groups. The LTA decided to introduce a Ranking System so that players can measure their success on a tournament by tournament basis.  The Ranking system is based on tournament performance irrespective of opponent. Rankings also allow equally rated players to see who ' s performing best within their band. LTA Ranking is based on a players best 6 tournament performances over a rolling 12 month period. Competitions are graded with grade 1 being the highest.

5 Coaching / Training The Player Development leaflet (download link) can be used as a general guideline to training but ultimately how much and how often is down to what can be fitted in and what the child is happy to do.  The Parents are important too (download link) leaflet also has useful advice in terms of avoiding injury and how to help your child cope psychologically. default.jpg TRUE 5
6 Lack of Girls in Tennis This is a national problem and is very hard to solve.  Many strategies have been tried in the past and are being tried currently.  It has been the subject of many a students thesis but no-one has come up with the magic solution.  Suffice to say it is always on the agenda and we are still trying. default.jpg FALSE 6
7 The Countys Role The Countys role is to create a good environment and provide opportunities outside those that can be provided at club level. For example:

 Grants to clubs to assist with facility development 
 Over £2.25 million LTA investment in covered courts secured by Devon LTA in the last 3 years
 Grants to clubs and coaches to assist with coaching programmes
 County team of Performance Coaches providing County trips, clay court camps, County Cup training, age group tennis camps etc. default.jpg FALSE 7

3 tournament dos & don'ts (advice for players, parents and coaches) The following dos and don'ts are useful tips for players, parents and coaches.


<b>When applying for a tournament / competition</b>

<b>DO</b> apply early. All competitions have published closing deadlines and some popular tournaments accept players on a first-come basis. Many tournaments will insist on receiving an application and payment prior to the closing deadline. Some tournaments do not accept applications by telephone.  Bear in mind that the number of players that can be accepted is limited by, for example, the type of draw, the number of courts available, the time span of the competition etc.

<b>DO</b> read tournament literature, including entry forms and information sheets.  These set out all the conditions and rules of the event and should answer most questions you may have.  

<b>DO</b> check with the tournament organizer or referee if there is anything at all that you are not sure about. They are there to help you.

<b>DO</b> check cancellation and withdrawal deadlines.  Organizing draws is a very complicated, time consuming exercise.  Players pulling out at the last minute can throw out a whole competition requiring a new draw to be made therefore you should not expect a refund if you are unable to play after the draw has been made and in some circumstances you may also be penalized by the LTA.

<b>DO</b> make sure you are available for the whole period of the competition.   If a tournament is a week long you may be required to play on any of the days.  An event cannot be organized around an individual players requirements. 

<b>DO</b> keep a record of the competitions you have entered. Remember, it is your responsibility to check whether you have been accepted and the date and time you are needed to report for play.

<b>DON'T</b> enter more than one competition which could require you to play on the same day. You are likely to be penalized if you do this. Check with the organizers BEFORE the cancellation/withdrawal deadlines, if you are in doubt.


<hr>

<b>Preparing for the tournament</b>

<b>DO</b> allow enough time for your journey including allowances for delays.

<b>DO</b> arrive by the time you have been asked to report, normally 15 minutes before your first match.  You will probably be expected to sign in with the referee on arrival and you must do this in person.

<b>DO</b> remember that tennis matches vary in length, so be prepared for a possible wait, particularly if a tournament has been affected by bad weather.

<b>DO</b> remember to check in advance if there are any rules about what you should wear.  Indoor venues may have strict rules about the sort of tennis shoes you need to wear and some may have an all white rule.  You may not be allowed to play if you dont comply.

<b>DO</b> contact the referee if you are running late. If the referee knows then it may be possible to delay your match. Tournaments wont just wait for you to turn up. 


<hr>

<b>If you are unable to play</b>

<b>DO</b> make sure that you contact the referee or organizer as soon as you know you wont be able to play and that they acknowledge your withdrawal.  Late withdrawals can cause great problems for organizers and let down other players.

<b>DON'T</b> forget that once the draw has been made, you are expected to play unless ill or injured. It is possible for players who withdraw to be penalized by the LTA so you may be asked to provide some form of evidence. In some cases, you may need to complete a withdrawal form - the tournament referee will advise you what you need to do.


<hr>

<b>Before your match</b>

<b>DO</b> remember to take everything you need with you on court. You should not leave the court for any reason during a match other than to ask for the referee. A toilet break should only be taken at the end of a set.

<b>DO</b> make sure you know which match format is being used. Even within a tournament there are sometimes several different formats e.g. short-sets, third sets being replaced with a match tiebreak, final sets being played without tiebreaks. If in doubt, always ask the referee, they are there to help.

<b>DON'T</b> walk across the back of other courts whilst play is in progress. Wait until a suitable break in play.

<b>DO</b> make sure you warm up properly before you go on court for your match, remember you usually only get 5 minutes before play actually starts.


<hr>

<b>During your match</b>

<b>DO</b> call the score, after every point, if you are serving. You are also responsible for calling all out-balls on your side of the net. Make sure your calls are loud, clear and prompt. (If your match is umpired then they will take care of all calls and scoring).

<b>DO</b> treat your opponent, officials and spectators with courtesy and respect.

<b>DO</b> remember that if you have a problem during the match which you cannot resolve yourself, the referee (or assistant) is there to help you.

<b>DON'T</b> swear, throw rackets/balls in temper or behave in an unsportsmanlike manner. This is discourteous and can result in you being penalized.

<b>DON'T</b> talk with parents, coaches or friends during a match. It is against the rules.


<hr>

<b>After your match</b>

<b>DO</b> remember to shake your opponents hand, even if you have had a difficult match.

<b>DO</b> leave the court quickly and report your result to the referee, even if you lost the match.

<b>DO</b> remember to find out when you are playing next. Even if you have lost you might be able to take part in bonus, plate or consolation rounds.  This is sometimes compulsory.

<b>DO</b> remember to thank the tournament officials. They are generally hard working and dedicated people  many are volunteers. FALSE tournament default.jpg

10 2007-09-19 We are instructed by the buyers of this prominent building and site to offer it to let in various sized Lots to suit tenant demand.  On a site of just over 7 acres with tremenduous vehicle flow past and located opposite Sainsburys the property was purpose built for C H Brannam (Pottery) and comprises an existing pottery with ancilliary warehouse and office accomodation, together with factory shop, cafe/restaurant and small visitors centre.  Original buildings date from circa 1988 with a warehouse extension having been added in 1995.  Two additonal open fronted warehouses were built around 1998.  The main factory building is of steel framed construction with external elevations being finished with a combination of facing brick and profile metal cladding.  The roof is of pitch design with profile metal cladding over.  The accommodation has a minimum eaves height of approximately 16'9 (5.1m).

The warehouse extension is also steel portal framed construction with a combination of facing brick and profile metal cladding elevations beneath a pitched roof with profile metal cladding over.  

The two open fronted warehouses within the yard area are of steel framed construction with profile metal cladding elevations and roofs.  In all close to 73,000 sq ft of space is available (6781msq) and will be refurbished and remodelled by our clients to comprise various sized units, subject to tenant requirement.  As the site is in excess of 7 acres there are considerable parking and loading facilities.  We are anticipating receiving rental offers at around £7 per sq ft and would therefore invite "expressions of interest" in the availability, irrespective of size that you require.  The premises benefit B1, B2 and B8 uses (industrial and warehousing).  Contact to register your early interest now!

22 2008-01-25 We have been instructed to sell centrally located commercial premises in Braunton, namely 2 Caen Street, which is prominently positioned just off the Square which is regarded as the retail core of the village.  The property is positioned literally at the traffic lights and thus can enjoy vehicular visibility.  The accommodation is arranged over two floors and provides just short of 1,000 space.  Rarely do freehold properties become available in this thriving village.  Presently the building trades as a retail shop for the sale of Board Sports equipment but in the recent past has been used as a jewellers and around 2000 a Tea Rooms.  The first floor accommodation is at presently arranged as a showroom but may hold potential for conversion to a small flat for the owners (subject to obtaining necessary planning consent).  At the rear is a small courtyard with WC and storage facility and the entire building benefits gas fired central heating.  Clearly the availability of this property will provide an opportunity for an owner/occupier who may wish to run their business (and/or live) at the property or to investors who may wish to create a return by letting the property as a whole or in parts.  We do see the availability of these premises as an excellent opportunity for the market and will be pleased to make viewing arrangements for you.

AGENTS NOTE:  If required our client is prepared to consider a sale of the existing business as a going concern.

97 As you may be aware the Government has introduced new legislation as part of the European Union Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EUEPBD England & Wales) Regulation 2007 whereby any commercial property be marketed for sale or lease from 1st October 2008 (whether offered through an Agent or independently by the seller/landlord) will require an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) the landlord or owner of the building is responsible to provide such Certificate and could be fined 12.5% of the rateable value if one is not prepared.

Clearly therefore in order that your business/property can continue to be offered to the market beyond this date arrangements will need to be made with a suitably qualified assessor who is able to provide such a report.  The report itself identifies 3 key figures for the building. 

1.	The actual rating for that building based upon the inspection carried out by the Energy Assessor.

2.	The stock average rating for buildings of similar type and

3.	A rating for that building if it was built in accordance with 2006 Building Regulations.

The report also identifies the rating in form of a Band A to G.  This banding assessment must be reproduced in a table format on sales particulars and be available for inspection by interested parties.

Whilst clearly this legislation will create additional administration and costs at a time when the market could least do with it, there is no choice in the matter if you wish to sell or let your commercial property.  

I have had several meetings with duly qualified assessors (both locally and nationally based) and have decided to recommend a local company  and will naturally be pleased to put them in touch with you.  This Company will charge on a rate based on the property involved rather than on a square metre basis which I believe may well end up considerably cheaper in the case of larger commercial buildings.  As a guide, the Company have indicated that costings for providing a report will be in the order of £350-£550 ( depending on the size of the building and the amount of information which may be held on it's construction. Clearly though this new legislation will effect the timing of marketing with commercial properties and we will be unable to offer properties to rent of for sale beyond this 1st October deadline with such certificate or at where one has been commissioned to be prepared.
Please call us to discuss further.

It lies at the end of the North Devon Link Road, which provides a fast link to the M5 motorway at junction 27 and Main Line Rail services to Paddington from Tiverton Parkway.  There is also a direct rail link to Exeter on the picturesque Tarka Line.  

DESCRIPTION - Having just acquired the site which comprises close on 73,000 sq ft (6,782m²) on some 7 acres it is our clients intention to offer the premises To Let in various Lot sizes which will be lead by tenant requirement.  At this early stage therefore we are inviting expressions of interest based on size requirement in order that a development plan can be co-ordinated.  It is our clients intention to refurbish and re-arrange the units as required. ACCOMMODATION - Basically there are 3 main buildings.  These may be described as follows:

Building A - This is the existing modern purpose built pottery with ancillary warehouse and office accommodation together with factory shop, café/restaurant and small visitors centre.  It is of steel framed construction with external elevations finished with a combination of facing brick and profile metal cladding.  The accommodation is a minimum eaves height of approximately 169 (5.1m²).  The main building dates from 1988 with an adjoining warehouse extension added in 1995 of similar construction.  This building provides circa 52,000 sq ft (4,867m²) over ground and first floor.  

Building B - This comprises an open fronted warehouse with yard area.  It is of steel framed construction with profiled metal clad elevations and roofs.

Ilfracombe is a pretty coastal town in North Devon set between the National Park of Exmoor to the East and golden coasts with surfing beaches to the West.  The destination has been a significant holiday attraction for many years as well as supporting a local population of around 10,000.  Both Ilfracombe and this section of magnificent coastline is a remarkable place in which to live, work and holiday.

The Café is prominently located on the High Street in an excellent trading position for both footfall and traffic flow past.  Opening hours are currently quite limited which has been the choice of our clients although clearly these can be extended, if desired.  Winter opening  closed Monday, Tuesday 12.00 noon  2.00pm, Wednesday through to Saturday 10.00am  3.00pm, Sunday 12.00 noon  2.00pm.  
Summer opening  10.00am  4.00pm and opening Thursday through to Saturday evenings 6.00pm  9.00pm last order.   A full restaurant alcohol license is held. Generally
Combe Cottage originates from the pre Victorian era (late 18th century) and retains much charm and original features, (fireplaces and oak beams in the restaurant area) and yet combines modern facilities and comfortable living standards.  Indeed the property was the subject of major refurbishment (by former owners) around 5 years ago and this becomes immediately evident.  We consider that the owners apartment ranks as one of the best we have seen for a long time.

Our clients operate a traditional English Café and Restaurant though we consider that the business is capable of being themed on the desires and experience of any new owners.  The atmosphere of the property would, we believe allow the customers to be relaxed were the business to be traded as tea rooms, café, restaurant, bistro, or any particular individual catering style. FREEHOLD Agents remarks:  We believe that this catering business would be an ideal opportunity for a husband and wife partnership that is looking for a business which they can run comfortably themselves with the need of little staff employment and enjoy the benefits of living in the West Country.

LYNTON
DEVON £195,000 REDUCED EX31 1BD TRADITIONAL FISH & CHIP TAKEAWAY ENTERPRISE WITH 2 BEDROOMED PRIVATE ACCOMMODATION AND SITUATED IN ONE OF DEVON'S MOST PICTURESQUE COASTAL RESORTS 

The business represents an ideal home with income for a couple and is ideally suited as a first venture proposition.  The owner runs the concern virtually single handed and achieves a turnover (we are advised) of £45,000 - £46,000 opening on limited hours (through choice) over 9 months.  The industry norm would indicate net profit levels to be around 50% of this figure.  Trading accounts will be made available to bona fide purchasers after they have viewed the business although we would stress that as stated below the opening hours have been extensively restricted as the current owner has other business interests in the area and does not live at the property.    

OPENING HOURS
Winter Friday & Saturday night opening only 5.00pm  9.00pm.
Summer 12.00 noon  9.00pm, closed Sunday, Monday and Wednesday.

TRADING STYLE
The Fish and Chip establishment has been situated on this site for many years and owned and operated by the current family for 15 years.  The business provides a conventional take away menu, retailing predominantly fish and chips.  The business may well be situated to additional lines to drive up turnover. lyntonfishbarone.jpg lyntonfishbartwo.jpg default.jpg default.jpg default.jpg default.jpg AVAILABLE FALSE BUSINESS 0000-00-00 530 FISH & CHIP TAKEAWAY LYNTON FISH BAR LOCATION
Barnstaple 18 miles.  Bristol 80 miles.  Tiverton (M5 motorway) 50 miles.

SITUATION
This business is centrally located in the lovely seaside town of Lynton which nestles on the hilltop overlooking its sister village Lynmouth and magnificent coastal backdrop.  The Victorians affectionately named this area Englands little Switzerland  where Exmoor meets the sea and without any question it is one of the most picturesque and tranquil parts of the magnificent North Devon coastline.  Not surprisingly the area is visited by tens of thousands of tourists year round.  Lynton Fish Bar also benefits from year round local community trade and the business trades unopposed in the village.  Whilst opening hours are rather limited at present (through the choice of the current owner) there is obvious potential to increase turnover considerably. The building enjoys a central situation in the village being arranged on 5 floors with the lower ground floor providing kitchen, preparation and storage areas.  The ground floor provides a traditional take away area which is fully and well equipped with stainless steel commercial equipment.  The first, second and third floors provide a proprietors apartment with 2 bedrooms, (both en suite) and a large lounge dining kitchen.  The building is a rather handsome villa of dressed natural stone beneath a slate roof and features an attractive balcony at first floor leading from the lounge.  Planning permission has just been obtained to enable the upper floor living accommodation to be self-contained from the take away and thus potentially this could be let separately.  Surrounding properties in this part of Lynton, the old town are characterful and provide a pleasurable atmosphere. 
Ground Floor
Double fronted shop unit (360sq ft) being light and airy with non slip floor.  Florigo two pan electric range with scuttle and warming cupboard (regularly serviced) Florigo steel customer service, electronic cash register, refrigerator, upright chiller in stainless steel casing.
Basement

Owners Accommodation
Agents Note:  Currently the owners flat is accessed direct from the take away.  Planning permission has been obtained to create a separate entrance from the front of the property thus enabling the owners accommodation to be self contained.

SITUATION - Ilfracombe, on the lovely North Devon coastline is a small, peaceful town made famous by the Victorians at the turn of last century and being a popular destination for family holidays for generations.  These days, the town and indeed the area generally has become very popular for those wishing to retire, semi-retire or simply enjoy an enviable lifestyle out of the rat race.  That is not to say that the town is not developing.  In fact far from it.  The Harbour area (shown over) is expected to be developed and indeed there are plans to introduce new residential development and possibly attempts to create an all water harbour.  The well known artist Damian Hurst is opening a restaurant in the next few weeks.  

The town serves a resident population of around 10,000 persons although this is thought to increase 6 or 7 fold during the summer months.  A multi million pound theatre and conference centre built a few years ago and sited on the Seafront has improved the attraction of the town and lengthened the tourist season.

Ilfracombe has been a popular holiday resort since Victorian times nestling amongst the rugged Atlantic cliffs it has a lovely old natural harbour and elegant Victorian architecture.  From Capstone and Lantern Hills there are wonderful views across the Channel to Wales.  The Torrs Walk is one of the finest cliff walks in England.  Families flock from all over the country to enjoy its beaches, harbour and award winning attractions.  It is planned to re-introduce a passenger ferry from Swansea this summer.  

Situation 
Fore Street is Ilfracombes oldest street linking the Harbour to the High Street and its origins can be tracked to the 13th century.  The substantial business premises enjoy a bold corner site with strong visibility and good footfall during the holiday season. 

PHOTOGRAPHS SHOW THE HARBOUR NEARBY AND COAST. The Property
A solid Victorian building with restaurant and bar, cloakrooms, commercial kitchens and hot food takeaway at ground level and 4 to 5 bedroom living accommodation above, gas central heating.

























Internal details 
Main café area (232 x 181) covers 20, bar servery, corner frontage.  WC facilities.  Main kitchen (168 x 130) L shaped, wash up space off.  Comprehensive inventory.  Former Take Away (1310 x 92) leading off main street, not utilised.  

Owners accommodation 
Separate side access leading to upper floors.  Private kitchen 139 x 88 with usual fitments, work surfaces etc.  Study/Bedroom (911 x 99), Sitting Room (185 x 140) stained glass window.

External details
There is a roof top patio garden accessed from the first floor. FREEHOLD Potential
Quite clearly Take Thyme is operated on a significantly restricted opening basis due to the personal circumstances of the existing proprietor.  We see no reason at all why trade could not be increased considerably particularly during the holiday season.  There are opportunities to open throughout the day and evening and as the town has become well known in the region as a venue for good restaurants out of season opening could also be undertaken. UK

6 Why the South West Needs Sustainable Tourism

The South West has more visitors than any other region. Tourism is a growing part of the economy with over 20,000 businesses providing 1 in 10 of our jobs. The industry is worth an estimated £5 billion per year!

The challenge is to maximise the benefits and reduce the negative impacts. This is the aim of sustainable tourism - to maintain successful long term tourism by ensuring our region continues to be attractive and welcoming for the future. 

<b>The Benefits </b>

· Improving our environmental assets 
· Minimising waste

25 2005-10-21 THE SHOW SEASON- 2005!
Well - it would be safe to say that 2005 exceeded all our hopes, dreams and expectations. The season kicked off for us - as always - with our local show DEVON COUNTY. Euphoria, the lightweight mare was Champion of her section and then her foal followed suit by winning a good class.

BATH & WEST followed and it was the turn of EVE'S WISH to fly the Langaller Flag. She duly won a good class and then stood Reserve Champion to her 3yr old son EVE n' MORE.

IRISH BREEZE represented Langaller at ROYAL CORNWALL and took the Small Hunter class in very good company. One of LOSTOCK HUNTSMAN'S children,  who lives with us then took the Reserve Championship in the Coloured section - a pleasing result allround in Stephen's home county.

MIDLANS IN-HAND is always a popular show and we were understandably delighted when EUPHORIA swept the board and was Champion Hunter and Mare Supreme. Her foal by CATHERSTON DAZZLER won its class and the overall foal championship.

EVE'S WISH was the mare chosen to make the long journey to GREAT YORKSHIRE. This show has long been a target for Langaller and our first foray there was certainly memorable. She won the Lightweight mares, the Mare Championship and then the CUDDY SUPREME IN-HAND, finally qualifying for the elusive HORSE OF THE YEAR SHOW. Her lovely grey, filly foal was 2nd in its class-one of the only times she was beaten all season! Strangely enough the journey home to Devon seemed much shorter!

Having qualified, her final outing prior to HOYS was to one of our favorite shows - NEW FOREST & HAMPSHIRE. yet again she won and was Champion - her foal won too!

EUPHORIA  contested three One Day Agricultural Shows - taking all before her and standing SUPREME OF SHOW on 2 occassions and Reserve Supreme on the third.

THE NATIONAL HUNTER SHOW at Addington is always a target for us and after an amazing show last year we wondered if this year would be an anti-climax. FAR FROM IT!!! IRISH BREEZE was 2nd, her foal won and was Reserve Champion and EUPHORIA swept all before her to take the Overall in-Hand Championship and the coveted Cuddy ticket. Incredibly this meant we had 2 mares through to HOYS. This incredible achievement was tinged with a touch of regret - EVE N MORE - the prolific winning son of EVE'S WISH by PRINCE OF DARKNESS stood RESERVE in The Cuddy - having also achieved the same result the previous week at Bucks County. This lovely 3 yr old has had a fantastic season and it would have been a unique achievement to have mother and son through to Birmingham!

The penultimate show for the Langaller team was The BSHC&RH Champs - again at Addington. Here Stephen's Small riding Horse mare OPHICHUS was 2nd and her DAZZLER foal won its class!

So that was it - the outdoor season finished! It came and went in a flash! The horses did us proud. Their results were due in no small part to Stephen's production and hard work. Without his dedication and enthusiasm it would not have been possible!

Then began the task of getting organised for HOYS. Stephen worked incredibly hard on the mares to keep their coats looking good and put a bit more flesh on. It's difficult to keep the mares looking really well when their huge, greedy foals are still on them - with thirst more akin to the England Cricket Team!

Nigel & Lesley Wilmington kindly agreed to help us at Birmingham and did a fantastic job throughout. Another huge thank you must go to Wendy Gibson who took on the task of that all important, final preparation and had the mares absolutely gleaming!

EUPHORIA went like a dream and won a strong horse section and stood Reserve Supreme with EVE'S WISH
finishing in the ribbons too. default.jpg Show Season 2005
26 2007-01-21 March the 8th.   . I see in the diary that that was also the day that the blind man came. That is the man to fit the blinds not a blind man ! Then on the 12th the first of my Kuwait Beach mares foaled a grey filly by Dazzler, definitely one bred in the purple for the Eventer market. Foals seemed to come thick and fast from then on, a total of nearly 30 in fact. Not all ours I hasten to add, we foal an increasing number of visiting mares year on year. It takes the worry out of foaling for those who are either inexperienced or who have their stables away from the house. Most mares foal very quickly and easily but when they dont you have to act quickly. No season goes entirely without incident and 2006 was no different. On the night of 31st of March a visiting mare started to foal and unfortunately the foal was presented wrongly and despite the combined efforts of ourselves and two veterinary surgeons we lost both the mare and the foal. That same night one of my own mares, possibly my favourite mare, Loughbeg Marie, started to show signs of discomfort. To me it looked more like colic than foaling. Thankfully the vets. were still on site and an internal examination proved that it was more than foaling contractions and it was decided to take her straight to the clinic. It was now about half past two in the morning and I was speeding up the motorway with a second major catastrophe looming. When I arrived there were 4 vets. and a nurse all scrubbed up and ready.  Marie underwent a caesarian delivery because the foal had flipped the uterus over and twisted it. Mercifully both the mare and the foal survived. The foal is a colt by Kuwait Beach and was conceived using frozen semen. Marie is by Im A Star so we have great hopes for this colt with that pedigree. I cant speak too highly of the entire team at Western Counties Equine Clinic and am pleased to take this opportunity to thank them. Simon Joiner is one of the partners and was involved in both traumas that night and the colt is known at home as Simon and has been registered as Join The Q. 
	We are occasionally asked to help with fostering orphaned foals onto mares that have lost their own foals and this year we successfully fostered two foals. Its very rewarding to see these foals out in the fields with the others playing and careering around when you think of what might have been.
	Most of you will know that showing is very much an integral part of our business and 2005 was an incredible year for us, culminating in winning at Horse Of  The Year show with our Hunter Broodmare Euphoria. Our season in 2006 kicked of as usual with our local Devon County Show. We had hoped to show some of our youngstock but we simply didnt have enough time to produce them and so we set off with our seasoned broodmare campaigners, Euphoria in the open classes and Irish Breeze in the small hunters. I plaited Euphoria first on the lorry and then Breeze second. I moved under Breezes head and noticed blood on the wall and looking up saw that she had sliced her head above her eye badly enough that it needed stitching. Strangely I was more cross that Id wasted time plaiting her than I was concerned about the cut. Thankfully the duty vet. was very good with a needle and in no time the scar disappeared. Needless to say she didnt make her class, in fact she never came off the lorry, although according to the Horse and Hound report she was 3rd !!! Euphoria triumphed for the second year running, winning her class and the broodmare Championship. Returning on the Saturday to compete for the Cuddy qualifier is always a nerve racking time as it would mean so much to qualify on home ground. Euphoria, as always rose to the occasion and stood a very creditable Reserve. That was the start of her bridesmaid year as far as Cuddy qualifiers were concerned . She stood reseve no less than 3 times from 4 opportunities. The Royal will stand out in this years showing season for us. Euphoria won the lightweight broodmare class, the Broodmare Championship, The overall Led Hunter Championship, The Supreme In Hand Light Horse Championship and stood reserve for The Cuddy. Fantastic. This mare is amazingly consistent. She is carrying to Weld for 2007.
A new show for us this year was Cheshire County. It has a very good reputation for both quantity and quality in the led hunter section and as we now have friends living very close to the show ground it was a good chance to combine business and pleasure. Our friends are Jamie Nicklin and his fiancée Faye.  Jamie whipped in to our local foxhounds before taking the Huntsman position with The Cheshire Forest. Viv Booth has been a tremendous help with showing the foals as it is now impossible for Stephen and myself to both be away. She has given up a lot of her time to travel with us around the country. Thanks Viv.  The led classes at Cheshire dont start until 12 noon and so at half past six Viv and I whipped in to Jamie on hound exercise. It was a fantastic morning and a lovely way to start the day.  Viv and I were soaked up to our knees in dew and we stood at the midway point on the edge of the lake at Peover Hall watching the hounds wading and swimming around Jamie who was standing at the end of a very rickety jetty. It was one of those mornings that will long be remembered and has certainly cemented Cheshire County in our showing diary. Bad luck Jamie ! Euphoria and her son, Euphoric aka Eric by Dazzler , both won their classes and the mare stood Reserve Champion. As I mentioned before, we had tried and failed to show any of our own youngsters but others by our stallions represented us very well. Ridden winners included last years Hunter Show Champion, Even More by Prince Of Darkness out of Eves Wish who won his four year old class at Royal Cornwall. At the same show another POD offspring won the HOYS qualifier Open Working Hunter and jumped one of the few clear rounds in the final at the NEC in October. Another ridden winner and HOYS qualifier was Shipton Charisma by Shipton Teasel. She went on to be 3rd in the M and M working hunter pony final at HOYS. Led Champions include Figaro II, bred by Di Sexon by Lostock Huntsman and out of her young Bandmaster mare, Opera. He is now owned by Michelle Larkin and produced by Moggy Hennesy. His season culminated in being the overall led Champion  at The Hunter Show in September and qualifying for the Cuddy. The overall foal Championship was won by Miranda Skinners foal Hudson Bay by No Submission out of her novice and middle weight winner Tiger Bay II. These results mean that Langaller either bred or owns the sire of: the Res Champ foal {2005} Champion foal {2006}, The Champion led {2005/2006}. We also won the Broodmare Championship in 2005/2006. Lostock Huntsman now has his first Graded son in Jane Thrupps Rocombe Stan The Man; lovely horse, shame about the name ! He was Champion at the BSPA grading in October. Weld continues producing numerous winners on the race track, probably his best in 06 was Hot Weld who won the four mile chase at Cheltenham and we believe Weld was the only British based stallion to produce a winner during the festival.   
	On the stud front 2006 has been incredibly busy with over 260 mares either visiting us or being AId with semen from our stallions. All those of you who have dealt with us throughout 2006 will have met our newest recruit. Rose Miners joined the team in February and is the person who has helped so much by taking on the day to day running of the office. She has a wealth of stud knowledge gained from running an Arabian stud with her parents for many years. I am told she is much nicer to talk to than I am. Rubbish!
	As I said before we started foaling in March and the last foal was born in July and I would guess that neither Stephen nor I slept in a bed for more than about 7 or 8 nights throughout preferring, to sleep either in the chair or on the floor watching the camera monitor. Sarah and Emma both worked extremely hard throughout the summer often doing 12 hour days and again I want to say a very public thank you to them. 
Our summer wouldnt be complete without our hound puppies. Last years couple were Hectic { bitch} and Moral {dog}. Both did well at the puppy show, both being placed 5th. This year we have walked Girdle and Giveaway, litter sisters out of Willow whom we walked 2 years ago and by Gideon. They have inherited their mothers affable disposition and their fathers looks. Sadly! They stayed with us until August when Ian asked to have them back. No huntsman asks for puppies to be returned early unless.he wants you to have more ! There was a single dog puppy at kennels drafted in from The Old Berks. By South Devon Roscoe, Rumpus duly arrived and very quickly became very much part of the family, sleeping in the chair in the kitchen and far too quickly learnt to open the door which now means the house is like Fort Knox, locked at all times. When hounds met here last week he hunted, within the law of course, until 2 O clock !!
	In June we were very honoured to be asked by H.R.H.The Prince Of Wales if we would take care of a stallion for him. He and The Duchess Of Cornwall had been given an Arabian stallion during their visit to Saudi Arabia. Goudah arrived in late June and stayed with us until earlier this month when he was moved to an Arabian stud in Herefordshire where he will stand for 2006. Regretfully Stafford Twilight has returned to his owners in Hampshire following a quiet season. I am very glad to say that I have 3 mares of my own in foal to him. I think he was very under-rated by mare owners and I am really looking forward to seeing my foals next spring.
	NEW for 2007. Yes we do have a NEW stallion for next season. We have always felt that standing top quality stallions is vital and we were very excited to be offered Catherston Dazzler back in 2003. We are very privileged to have a second Catherston stallion now on the yard with the arrival of Catherston Liberator. He is in fact Dazzlers great nephew, Liberators grandam Dutch Sika is Dazzlers full sister. Liberator is by the Thoroughbred Liboi and out of the Jashin mare Catherston Jetstream. He is himself an Advanced Eventer and a Prix St George dressage horse. He has fantastic stature and limbs and the athleticism you would expect from his pedigree with a temperament which is second to none. Come and see him, you wont be disappointed.

	May I wish you all a very Happy Christmas and we look forward to seeing you in the New Year.

27 2008-01-14 You may remember last year we started having stallion viewings before Christmas ? Today is the 26th of October and we have already had three prospective viewings...so far !
	As the last of the seasons mares go home and the clocks change the timing seems right to put pen to paper and review the year.
	Our first foal was born on March 16th, a beautiful bay filly by Weld out of the multiple NH winning mare Broughton Manor by Dubasoff. As always, once we start we seem to go headlong into the foaling season. This year we have foaled nearly 40 mares, not all ours I hasten to add ! With one exception all of the foalings went well and in no time at all the fields were filling with gangly babies learning to balance, then to chase and play. The weather was very kind and the early spring was very much appreciated. For the first time that I can remember we had turned out the youngstock and the later foaling mares by the last week of March, fully expecting to have to bring them back inside but mercifully April was dry and very warm, even hot in fact. Not long until June! Thankfully Devon County Show just managed to stay dry and then it started to rain. And rain, and rain, and rain. By now the majority of the mares had foaled and a lot of visiting mares had arrived with their respected offspring too. By the end of the second week of June things were getting serious and the foals were struggling against the cold and the wet and so we bedded up the covered yards, filled the feeders and opened the gates and then stood back as 30+ mares and foals stampeded across the home paddock and into the yard. A very expensive exercise as by now we were having to buy in haylage but there was no other option. As with lambs, foals can survive the cold if its dry but not incessant rain. Within just a few minutes the mares were lined up along the hay troughs and the foals were spread out in the straw sleeping, dry at last for the first time in days. The workload on the yard was incredible with 20 or so mares and young foals already stabled and over 100 mares at grass, Stephen and the girls deserve medals, at least. The gates were left open but the mares preferred to stay inside for the best part of a fortnight. Sadly there is simply not enough room to have the youngsters and the maiden/barren mares inside at this time of year. Drier weather settled in and things returned to somewhere close to normal. Surprisingly with such an upset in the weather most of the mares seemed to cycle throughout the summer and on the whole conception rates were good. I am convinced that the dry and warm spring had got the mares into a regular oestrus pattern which they maintained throughout.
	Our tally of mares covered, either AI or natural, by the end of the summer was nudging 300. The stable stalwart Catherston Dazzler, now nearing his 24th birthday, leads the fertility prize with 36 mares visiting and 34 conceiving. Lostock Huntsman remains as popular as ever and it is exciting now to see his early Devonian offspring making their mark as ridden horses this year. Jane Thrupps Rowcombe Stan The Man, was Champion at the B.S.P.A. stallion grading and has spent his first ridden year concentrating on his B.S.J.A. career. Mandy Pitts Freya has sailed through her first year British Eventing at Novice level and our own colt Langaller Bisto finished his first season finishing 2nd beaten by 1 point at Aldon Pre-Novice. Daws Firebird has a very loyal following and belies his 21 years. No Submission is on a roll ! He has been very busy and is becoming increasingly popular within the showing sphere with progeny winning up and down the country from foals to 3 year olds in Hack, Riding Horse and Hunter Breeding classes. Prince Of Darkness, the apple of my eye, has been quieter this term although he has had some lovely mares and again is really producing some super horses. Weld, of course, wins the crown for the most mares drawing them from all equestrian circles. Primarily from racing but an increasing number of event and show breeders are using him.  For Weld this season will stand alone. When standing stallions it is always so exciting to watch their offspring go on and succeed. We were so thrilled to watch Hot Weld win The Scottish Grand National and were hoarse from screaming at the television when we saw him go on and win the Betfred {formerly The Whitbread}, within a week putting him into the record books! In 2006 Weld was the only British based sire to have a winner at the Cheltenham Festival and in 2007 became the sire of the first horse ever to win Scottish National and the Betfred. According to 2007 statistics Weld is ranked 41st in the leading National Hunt sires list above such notable stallions as Classic Cliché {42nd}, Karinga Bay {48th} and  Phardante {62nd}. In the Sire of Chasers list he is ranked 21st above the likes of Alflora {32nd}, Overbury {36th} and Fourstars Allstar {40th}. I suggest you book him early for 2008! 
	The new boy, Catherston Liberator has been a very popular addition to the team and Im glad to say he will be staying for 2008. Shipton Teasel again has been busy covering 28 mares. Does this make him the busiest Connemara in the country? Quite probably.
	Our showing season traditionally starts with our local County show, Devon County. 2007 was a quiet start for us as Euphoria didnt foal until May and Eves Wish wasnt in foal for 07 and so we didnt have a hunter Broodmare to take. Stephens small hunter mare however had foaled in early April and so she had to fly the flag which she did admirably by winning her class with her foal by No Submission, winning his class too. My three year old filly { Even Tide by Kuwait Beach out of Eves Wish} was duly third in a strong three year old class. Bath and West is never a good show for us, I dont know why. Moving quickly on to Royal Cornwall and again Breeze showed herself well to be 2nd in the Small Hunter mare class and again her foal won his class. Evie { Even Tide} was again third and I must say I think hard done by. The Royal Show in July has always been an important date in our showing diary, possibly because we used to show cattle there many years ago. This year it provided Euphoria with her first outing. She followed her 2006 form by winning the Lightweight Broodmare Class and subsequently the Broodmare Championship. The following week we made what is now somewhat of a pilgrimage to The Great Yorkshire show in Harrogate. Sisters Breeze and Euphoria excelled themselves in the very best of company. Both won their respective classes and Euphoria was Champion Broodmare. She then went on to emulate the success of her stablemate Eves Wishs by claiming The Cuddy Supreme Championship thus qualifying for Horse Of  The Year Show. Then the round of local shows started: Evie won 3 Hunter Championships and Trenavey Consent, Breezes yearling by No Submission, now owned by Jane West, made her debut at Launceston standing a very respectable third to two County Show yearlings on quite possibly the wettest day of the year. Well it was July! She followed on to be Champion Riding Horse at Wincanton, winning again at Dunster before being placed 2nd in a very strong class at Bucks County. The National Hunter Show marks the end of the season for us and Euphoria again held off stiff opposition to win her class and stand Broodmare Champion, three Championships from three shows!!! Evie stood 2nd and Res Champion filly which I was absolutely thrilled with. She has now been sold and we look forward to seeing her out next season under saddle.
	 With the show and stud seasons running at the same time it is very difficult to fit them both in but we consider our showing to be a very good shop window for our stallions offspring. Initially Stephen always showed the foals but as the stud business has grown he now prefers to stay at home and run the yard and so Viv Booth very generously gives a lot of her time coming to the shows and she does an admirable job. I in turn do my part for care in the community by taking her !!! Turn the light on, Viv. {Private joke} 
	As a business I consider us to still be very much in our infancy, this being the end of our 7th season. Young horses by our stallions and carrying our prefixes {Langaller and Stephens Trenavey } are just starting their ridden careers and this year has seen us dip out toes into the eventing circle with a five year old coloured colt by Huntsman called Langaller Bisto. It felt very strange to be wearing the owners hat and having to stand back and watch but I have really enjoyed seeing my horse compete and hope I am now more of a help than a hindrance to team Boon. We are very privileged to have Terry Boon back in his native Westcountry and he has done a superb job in producing this colt for us. Not broken until the middle of his fourth year Bisto, has had just 4 runs BE eventing at Pre-novice. His dressage score has always been in the late 20s and he is always clear cross country. A couple of tweeks with his show jumping and Badminton here we come! Hey, you have to have ambition, dont you ?  Sadly he will probably be sold as we have a colt by Matinee { Trenavey Matson} that we hope Terry will compete for us next season and we simply cannot stretch the budget to two horses. Terry is partly sponsored by Puffa and Bisto is features in their new brochure and web-site.
	On the hound puppy front last years pups showed themselves well at the puppy show. Girdle was a respectable 3rd in her class but Rumpus and Giveaway were unplaced but Rumpus will show them how good he is now that hes hunting ! This year we have had another couple from dear old Wilful: Stylish and Steward. We walked Wilful and her sister Willow 4 or 5 summers ago. Steward learned the hard way that horses can be dangerous. He broke his leg within the first few weeks of being here when he tore in around Liberators stable chasing his sister and probably the cat. Poor Libby jumped sideways and accidentally stood on the pup. Thankfully at that age their bones soon mend and after a couple of weeks of being bound up he was as right as rain. He has grown into a beautiful, strong hound now, puppy show 08 ? Bring it on ! Stylish is a beautiful, feminine bitch, quite dark and nicely marked, quite shy but very affectionate. It was a real wrench when she moved back to kennels and she is one of the puppies that we have had that I would gladly have back in retirement. The other is Tussle from the same year as we had Willow and Wilful. By the end of September couple number 2 had arrived and are now ensconced. Dollar and Dorcus, two dog hounds. I know, I know. Dorcus is a girls name but apparently it is also the name of a wood in the Whaddon Chase country. Poor puppy !
	Many of you now will know Rose Miners who has organised and run the office for the last eighteen months. She has become a real asset to the team and plays a vital role in the running of the stud being new customers first point of contact. Sarah and Stephen as always have worked exceptionally hard throughout the year and I want to thank them publicly for all their help and support. Emma Routley decided to move onto pastures green in June of this year and so sisters Danni and Steph Parker job shared her position throughout the summer until Steph joined us full time in September. We have a few people throughout the summer here on work experience, some are completely useless, far more interested in texting their friends and plaiting their hair than the hard graft of stud work but we have had some very good girls come to us through this scheme. Emma initially came to us for a week and stayed for nearly 2 years and Danni Parker came to us first for a week and now is part of the team although is only here in holiday time. Big sister Steph has taken her job !  
	In the busiest part of the season our veterinary visits have been daily, sometimes nightly too, and again I am delighted to have Western Counties Equine Clinic supporting us in that role. The vets. and the girls at the clinic are always very helpful and supportive and are very much part of our team.particularly when plied with cake ! 
	May I wish everyone a very happy Christmas and a productive 2008


Very best wishes from

STOP PRESS: NEW FOR 2008  IRISH DRAUGHT STALLION  SANDY LIGHT default.jpg
28 2008-02-11 Here we go 2008! The first mares are here and we will be covering in the next couple of weeks. Our first foal is due in 10 days, EVE'S WISH due to PRINCE OF DARKNESS. The 'boys', LANGALLER BISTO {by Lostock Huntsman out of RED RHAPSODY} and TRENAVEY MATSON {by MATINEE DU MADON out HOLLYVAG SAPPHIRE} have gone to big school with Terry Boon. BISTO will be out at the early events in this his second season and Matson will follow on a little later as this is his first season. default.jpg
29 2008-03-17 The first foals have arrived safely. The first was a filly foal by Pursuit Of Love out of a visiting flatbred mare. She is now to be 'walked in' to Imperial Dancer. Eve's Wish, my Dallas mare, has a beautiful bay colt foal by Prince Of Darkness which is a full brother to multi County Show Champion Eve'n More. Two more mares are now over due and there are three due over the Easter weekend. Our young eventer Langaller Bisto, a coloured colt by Lostock Huntsman out of the TB mare Red Rhapsody, had his first run of 2008 at Aldon last Friday and had a fantastic double clear. He has come on so much over the winter that he will probably have one more PN next week, weather permitting before upgrading to Novice. Red Rhapsody is due to our Connemara shortly, hopefully that should make a super teenagers event type. She will probably bbe covered by Catherston Liberator this time now that she has proven her breeding abilities.
We took Sandy's Light to Talls Trees stallion parade along with Leo { Huntsman} and Liberator. He was so well behaved and generated a lot of interest, just confirming my expectations of him. Terry Boon rode the other boys. He hunted Leo the previous Wednesday and so has now ridden both father and son. Leo is such a good mover it was great to watch Terry ride him, both on the flat and then over a fence. Libs of course looked and went amazingly, he is such a superstar. Out next parade will be at Powderham horse trials. Libs also has been invited to parade at Badminton on the Friday afternoon. Weld is picking up so many winners now that the point to point season is well under way, hardly a meeting goes by without him being responsible for at least 1 winner. We all await The National with trepidation, fingers crossed for Captain Corelli. 
As with every year March and early April is completely manic as our hunting season runs until the middle of April, the coverings and foalings are in full swing and the youngstock for show production are here. This year being so wet has compounded the work load even further as we are still unable to turn anything out but I am sure that spring is just around the corner! default.jpg
30 2009-02-17 Maybe it is peculiar to Devon, or just the fact that Im getting older but I dont remember noticing the autumn colours ever being so vibrant and rich before. For at least 3 weeks every time I drove anywhere or even looked across the fields at home I was in awe of the bright orange and rich gold and fire red. With no significant frost these leaves lasted until the end of November. On the whole the autumn weather has been reasonably kind to us, it is now early December and we still have a number of youngsters living out although not for much longer. Whilst musing about the weather {I am aging all too rapidly, I know} we had a lovely summer, the sun shone and the birds sang and the early foaling went well. Then by the second week of April it clouded over. By the third week of May it was raining continuously, by June I think the average temperature was around 10 degrees and it felt more like Christmas than mid-summer. To celebrate we lit the fire. And so it remained throughout most of season. Surprisingly conception rates were good. However the adverse weather did make for a lot of extra work for Stephen, Sarah, Steph and Dani. As well as the stallions and show stock in stables, at the end of July we had as many as 16 mares with young foals stabled at night. 
	We had one new stallion this season namely the Irish Draught Sandys Light. Although not really my type I just love this horse. Tall for a Draught standing probably nearly 17hh, he is very light in his action and movement and has the kindest temperament. He is more like a dog really, very affectionate and gentle in an oafish kind of way. He reminds me very much of that big, hairy character in Harry Potter played by Robbie Coltrane.cant remember his name. We have used Sandy on some of our own mares and will certainly do so again in 09. I am quietly a little excited by him, I really think he could prove to be a star.
	 Catherston Dazzler again covered a number of very good mares, and all bar 2 I think, are in foal. He has an incredible record for fertility. Im guessing that in the last 3 seasons he will have covered about 100 or so mares with conception rates of 95% plus. I think that is fantastic for an older stallion.
	Leo is as busy as ever. His popularity just grows year on year which I guess is no surprise. Where else can you find such a versatile stallion with the conformation and temperament that he has? He is 17 now but fit and hunting this season.
	Daws Firebird belies his 22 years. Again he attracts a good book of mares each year. We have a lovely filly by him this year who is a definite show prospect for next season and we have a 2 year old hack filly coming here to be produced for 09.
	No Submission, again in advanced years now, is climbing to the top of the tree as a sire of top class show horses. A 4 year old by him qualified for Horse Of The Year this term, no mean achievement for a first season horse. Trenavey Consent by No Submission was unbeaten throughout the summer and again we have another 2 year old by him for next season. No matter what sort of mare he covers you can guarantee very smart, good moving, good fronted off-spring.
	Prince Of Darkness, of course, is perfect in everyway! Biased, me? Its no secret that the sun does indeed shine from his every pore. I think he now has 7 Advanced Eventing off-spring and numerous others coming through the ranks as well as his team of in hand and ridden show horses and working hunters.
	Weld features in practically every list of sires for National Hunt and Point to Point horses. In Horse and Hound last week the first horse listed as one to watch for the coming season is Chesnut Annie by Weld. As his racehorses have proven that his progeny can gallop and jump he is rightfully popular within the Eventing field and has covered 2 4* mares this season, and both in foal on 1st covering. Weld would be every bit as potent as Dazzler.
	Catherston Liberator is such an impressive stallion. Although standing at just under 16.2hh. His carriage and stature show him as much stronger type. We have a couple of outstanding foals by him and he does seem to be a stallion that when you have used him once you use again. He already has Advanced event progeny and there are many more in the pipeline. Liberator has returned to Catherston for the time being and is back competing in the Dressage arena.
	Shipton Teasel is another of our more senior stallions. He runs with his mares and lives out 24/7 with Clover. She is an old barren mare, neither green, four-leaved nor lucky. But Irish! Teasel is such a good cross on the TB type of mares as well as the pure-bred Connemaras. I have in fact just agreed a deal on a pure bred son of his.watch this space.
	Our show season started as usual at our local Devon County. A quiet start for us numerically with just 3 youngsters ready. My  3 year old filly {Langaller Even Keel [Pinkie]}by Kuwait Beach out of Eves Wish had her 1st outing since a foal, She stands a good 17hh and has taken until now to mature and body down enough. She won her class and stood Champion. Thats my girl! Eves Wish is THE most consistant breeder. She has had 5 foals for us and every single one a Champion. Trenavey Consent {Connie} bred by Stephen and now owned by Jane Ellis, by No Submission out of Irish Breeze won her 2 year old Riding Horse class and stood Res Champion. Janes other filly the 2 year old hack Delta Tango {Lupin} by Delta stood second in her class and was Res Champion. 1 Champion and 2 Reserves! Liz Mays coloured filly by Leo won the very strong Coloured Yearling class. On to Bath and West with just Pinkie and Connie next. Pinkie won her class and stood Champion Youngstock and Reserve Champion Led Hunter to the lovely broodmare Nutwood Exhibitionist. Connie took on the 2 year old hunter fillies and won. 2 horses, 2 wins, 1 Championship. Royal Cornwall is usually a good show for us. Again we set off with the girls. Pinkie stood 2nd in the mixed 3 year old class. Connie won the 2 year old Hunter Filly class. Lupin was second in her 2 year old hack class and Reserve Hack Youngstock Champion. Connie then won her 2 year old Riding Horse class and stood Champion of this section. Cheshire County was to be Eves Wishes {Fanny} only outing this year and I think sadly probably her last show as age is catching up with her and having had a number of foals we are now struggling to keep enough condition on her. Mother and daughter {Pinkie} headed North and Pinkie retained her run by taking the open 3 year old class and the led Championship. Fanny twisted herself unloading and so wasnt just level and so although pulled top of her class initially we asked to be excused. However her colt foal by Prince Of Darkness won the foal class and it was really for his benefit that we had taken them. He is such a lovely foal and I am looking forward to showing him in youngstock classes. He is offered for sale as a matter of policy but I hope he stays. The Royal was next and the first outing this season for Stephens Riding Horse Broodmare Endeavour. We were delighted with her 2nd place in a very strong class. Connie won her 2 year old Riding Horse class. Next was our annual pilgrimage to Yorkshire for the Great Yorkshire show. This year was the first time that we didnt take any broodmares but again Pinkie and Connie were our representatives. These two have been absolute stars throughout the year and again both won their respective classes. Connie and Lupin then went home to Janes for a well earned rest and Pinkie was turned out for a month. It is so tempting to over show youngsters when they are doing well but you have to remember their age and too much travelling is not good for their limbs. It sounds as if mine travel a lot but in fact Connie only did 5 shows and Pinkie 7. We finished our show season at The National Hunter Show where Pinkie won both the 3 year Hunter and Sports Horse classes. Producing young horses to be shown in hand has always been part of our business plan at Langaller and it is the aspect of the business that we may well try to expand. It is particularly gratifying to show off-spring of our stallions although we by no means limit our team to fit this criteria. 
	Most of you will know either through visiting us at home or through these letters that hound puppies are an integral part of life for us. In 2007 we walked Steward and Stylish, and then later in the season Dollar and Dorcus. Dollar was quite an independent soul and was soon starting to wander and so didnt stay with us too long. However Dorcus was the absolute opposite and stayed with us until early May this year and only then went to kennels reluctantly so as to be ready for the puppy show in June. This years couple arrive quite early, by the end of March I think and Dorcus immediately took charge and looked after his younger brother and sister. Bashful and Barnacle. Sadly Barnacle met a premature end when he was trampled by an over protective mare. Over the years Ive lost count of the number of hounds that we have walked and this is the first one that weve lost. Not the first to be stood on but the first that we have lost. There was another dog hound puppy from the same litter still to be placed and so number 3 arrived. As I said a dog puppy, from the same litter but un-named. So his name had to begin with BA. And so we called him Barryobviously! Bashful was never bashful, in fact completely the opposite. She was very self-assured and self confident and didnt take telling from man nor beast. Barry was just Barry. Happy, loving, quiet and contented, and happy just to be around the yard. Well initially anyway. As always with a good hound he did start to get the wander lust and he and sister started to go hunting and so they went back into kennels in September. Bashful did have one ride in the dog wardens van but I evaded being charged as she had been picked up in Ashburton Road and although we never use it in our address we actually live on Ashburton Road and so I claimed that in fact she hadnt gone anywhere. I think Barry has had to adjust to Barrister.
	All the foals are now weaned, the hunters are up, clipped and fit, broodmares and youngsters are in the barns and we will soon be turning our attentions to 2009 and whatever it holds for us. We have put all of the foals and yearlings up for sale simply to reduce numbers and workload and they are all listed on our website [www.langallerfarm.co.uk}. I am not good at selling horses that I like, it is very satisfying to see a field of beautiful home bred horses but with my commercial hat on we have to breed to sell. The two young Event stallions are also for sale. Langaller Bisto is a coloured 6 year old colt by Leo out of good Thoroughbred mare. He has been placed PN and N this season.  Trenavey Matson is, we believe the only stallion son of the Advanced stallion Matinee Du Madon and out of a Shaab mare who was just 4 points short of Advanced herself before she broken her pedal bone in a cattle grid. Matson is 5 and has had 2 runs at Intro at the end of this season just for education and will be up and ready for 2009. 
	We have had our first prospective viewings of stallions for 2009 matings and so we roll on into 2009. It is such an uncertain time with everyones financial status somewhat unstable but I do feel that if you have mare that you wish to breed from then you should, whether it is for your own use or to sell on. I am very proud of our stallions but they are ageing and if you want to use them I would urge you to do so sooner rather then later. There is always a demand for good stock whether they are horses, cattle or other and in these less than certain times..quality will out.

May we wish everyone a very happy Christmas and a peaceful New Year.

32 2009-09-28 Sandy's Light is on a roll! He has had a fanstastic stud season with many mares returning with their Sandy foals at foot. We haven't seen a bad one yet. At the Irish Draft Breed Show in September Sandy proved our faith in him by siring The Champion Pure-bred, the Champion Sport's Horse, the Champion Cob breeding and the Champion progeny group. What a star! sandy1.jpg
34 2010-01-12 What difficult times we are living in at the moment! All we hear about is doom and gloom, war and conflict. It can be so easy to get pulled down by what is going on around us. How fortunate those of us are whose lives are involved with the countryside, fresh air, open spaces and lovely animals. For those of you who are not familiar with Devon, and in particular Dartmoor, there is a particular view which always puts every aspect of my life into perspective. When you drive from Bovey Tracey to Widecombe in the Moor, home of the much lamented Uncle Tom Cobley, you climb up and up past Haytor and suddenly you drop over the top of Widecombe Hill and there below, deep in its valley, is the village with its famous Green and beautiful Church known as the Cathedral of the Moor. Looking left you can see for miles, almost down to the coast; lift your eyes and you can see the lower hills divided into a mosaic of neatly walled fields and farmsteads and strips, then the open moorland stretching out forever. Hundreds of acres of some of the most inhospitable country, littered with bogs and goyles. Beautiful in its vastness and unspoilt in its nature. To the right ,on the sky line, flashes the mast at Princetown, temporary home to some staying at Her Majestys pleasure! If you time it right you can sit on Venton, one of many tors, and watch the sun go down over Princetown. Just amazing! Usually though ,I lose concentration at the critical minute and miss it. Another far more local view is from our top field where I walk the dogs most mornings and where many of the youngsters spend the summer. From the top you can see Dartmoor and the aforementioned Haytor ,and then coming towards home you look down over the farm with its house nestled in with its stone barns wrapped around it and the more modern cattle yards around the borders. The fields and woodland spread around it, the town of Bovey Tracey lies to the north and in the distance is Teignmouth and the sea.. Paints a perdy picture, dont it? Come and see for yourselves.
	2009 started as always with hunting in full swing, early foaling mares getting uncomfortable and the show youngsters starting their prepping.  Our first visiting mare arrived to foal: a purebred arab mare who had been a bit sticky with her first foal last year and so had come to us to foal her second. Thankfully this time around she was much more settled and all went well. Our own mares then quickly followed. One of the earlier mares being Euphoria ,who has given me a lovely colt by Prince Of Darkness. What a good girl. We also had our first ever hunting pony come in at livery. Tiny belongs to Stephen Froy, for whom I have kept hunters for a couple of seasons now, and is ridden by his daughter. Tiny had a few ideas above his station ,particularly with his jumping. Steph is tiny too and so she rode the pony for a couple of weeks. We all fell about laughing when she first got on. Although small in stature, Steph usually rides out on the hunters, up to 17hh and fit, and to see her on the pony was hilarious. Anyway Tiny soon realised it was best not to argue and he and Wilhemina enjoyed some good hunting and a paper-chase! 
	Covering started the first week of March. My old show mare Eves Wish was covered by Leo {Lostock Huntsman} and conceived straight away and Woodlander Firefly caught to No Submission on the first covering and so 2010 foals arent far off now. I know a lot of mare owners decided against covering their mares this year and I can see their argument for doing so. However the good stock will always have a value in any breed,sheep, cattle, dogs and horses. My view is that a good mare, cow, bitch or ewe is always worth breeding from, a bad one never is. langaller farm 008.jpg
39 2011-05-04 Foaling is now in full swing with 14 on the ground and a lull now for just a few days. The early foals are growing away well and the mares a have been covered for 2012. The hound puppies arrived last week and are causing much merrirmnt.... and hassle. Over the years we have walked a number of hounds, this year we have a granddaughter of a bitch we walked 10 years ago and a daughter of another. We have 2 bitches this time called Wilful and Giveaway. default.jpg Foaling is now in full swing

1 Stallions at Stud Devon South West England Langaller Farm is situated on the edge of The Dartmoor National Park in a fertile valley basin. Comprising nearly 300 acres of prime grassland  the farm has been home to the Upham family for over 50 years. Until 1999 it was primarily a dairy unit with a top class pedigree herd of Friesian cattle.

However, the face of British Farming was changing and we started to look at diversification. Having sent mares away to stud for many years and with lots of experience breeding and rearing young horses - the stud seemed a natural progression......and so it was born

From the outset we adopted a policy to stand only top class stallions and have been very priviliged to have some of Britains 'truly greats' in terms of sport horse breeding. Without exception they have all proven themselves within their chosen discipline, with the older ones now having offspring competing at the highest level.

In order to offer breeders the widest choice of stallions we stand a full compliment including a Riding Pony, a Connemara, a Homozygous coloured Event/Show horse, an Advanced Eventer, an Anglo Arab, an Irish Draught stallion, two Thoroughbreds and a Sports Horse.

We also run a herd of our own broodmares where we have some of the very best of bloodlines for the competitive market including Kuwait Beach, Catherston Dazzler, Shaab, Mill Law, Gildoran, Daws Firebird, I'm A Star etc etc. Every day is an open day so do come in and wander round and see for yourself.

Reasonable stud fees, excellent grass keep and attention to detail are all part of the service at
Langaller. Mares are welcome back to foal down too,we can take care of those sleepless nights!
2 Langaller Farm Stallions The stallions at Langaller have their own courtyard of boxes situated right outside the back door, where they enjoy watchng all the activity on the farm. Invariably, this yard is full, as we try to offer our mare owners a broad selection of stallions suitable to breed; competition,show, race and riding horses on all types of mares.

4 Langaller Farm Mares We have spent a great deal of time and effort building up a top class band of mares, carrying the very best English and Irish bloodlines.

6 About Langaller Farm Langaller Farm has been home to the 'Upham' family for more than 50 years. Situated on the edge of Dartmoor national Park, it covers over 300 acres within a level valley basin.

Until recently, we have coupled our equine activities 
with a pedigree dairy unit of approximately 130Holstein cows. Horses, however, have always had a place within the business with particular emphasis on breeding, showing and hunting. British farming has been in steep decline for a number of years, and expansion of the equine side of the business has been a natural progression.

<strong>Facilities</strong>

We are delighted to board mares, and visiting mares often come back to foal down and be covered again. For many owners this takes the stress out of breeding - we take care of the 'sleepless night!' Foaling boxes are equipped with CCTV. In addition, all expectant mothers 
are fitted with 'state of the art' foaling alarms.

200 acres of prime dairy grassland ensures that all horses visiting the farm benefit from excellent pastureland, well maintained and rotated to keep it in tip top condition. Home grown hay, haylage and straw provide them with high class forage and bedding. 'Weight Watchers' paddocks are also available for those equine visitors belonging to the 'Larger Than Average Club'. Large barns and covered yards are ideal for 
loose housing during the winter months. Mares, foals and youngstock have their own buildings where they run in groups of 5 or 6. This is a favourite system of ours as the horses live as naturally as possible in a herd environment. Owners sending horses into board then have the choice of individual stabling or loose housing, depending on preference and pocket! about.jpg

9 2029-05-08 On only her second outing Langaller Eve'n Keel won her class at Bath and West before being awarded the Championship of the hunter Youngstock section. Trenavey Consent normally contests Small Hunter and Riding Horse classes but we took the plunge and entered her in the open 2 year old hunter filly class as there are no Small Hunter breeding classes scheduled. She duly won her class adding to her win at Devon County which cements the old addage that 'quality will out'. default.jpg Bath and West 2008
10 2014-06-08 Following her wins at both Devon County and Bath and West Langaller Eve'n Keel stood 2nd in the Hunter 3 year old.
Connie {Trenavey Consent} continued her unbeaten run by winning the Small Hunter 2 year old class, she then went on to win her 2 yer old Riding Horse class and stood Champion. An excellent result for her owner Jane Ellis who's Ridden Hack was also Champion.
Jane's Hack 2 year old Delta Tango was 2nd in her class and res Champion Hack youngstock. A very good show for 'team Ellis' ! default.jpg Royal Cornwall 2008
11 2021-06-08 A weeks fine weather meant that we stayed home and got our haylage made and wrapped instead of going to Three Counties and so our next outing was to Cheshire County. We stayed with friends at the Meynell kennels where Jamie is the Kennel-Huntsman and travelled on to the show on Tuesday morning. It was to be Eve's Wish'e 1st outing but when we unloaded she wasn't quite level and so we were excused the mare class but were delighted that her colt by Prince Of Darkness won the foal class. Eve'n Keel then won the three year old class beating the boys and stood over all led hunter Champion making it 3 out of 4 Championships at County level this season. She now goes to Great Yorkshire. default.jpg Cheshire County 2008
12 2012-07-08 The Royal has always been a favourite show for us ever since we showed cattle there years ago. This year it gave Stephen's Riding Horse broodmare her first outing of the season. We were thrilled for her to stand 2nd in such good company. I was less thrilled with her foal who was very generously awarded 4th place. He is a lovely foal and is now under a course going intensive discipline ! Jane West's Trenavey Consent, bred by Stephen, has been unbeaten this term stood 3rd in the 2 and 3 year old class beaten by 2 3 year olds, and so would have won if it had been a class for 2 year olds only.{ My way of twisting the results so that her reputation remains intact !}. Janes' hack filly, Delta Tango again was well placed in 4th. She is only a 2 year old and not born until June and so lacks a bit of maturity, look out 2009. default.jpg The Royal 2008
13 2012-07-08 Great Yorkshire is the highlight of our showing season. It is a 7 hour journey but always well worth it. The stewards are so helpful and polite and are getting used to our westcountry humour! In the past we have done very well with our broodmares here and so this time we decided to try with our youngstock. Trenavey Consent won the 2 year old filly class, retaining her unbeaten reign and Langaller Eve'n Keel won the 3 year old filly class following her wins at Devon, Bath and West and Cheshire. default.jpg Great Yorkshire 2008
14 2018-08-08 Totnes is our local agricultural show and we always try to support it. This year we took the Riding Horse broodmare Endeavour and her foal. We put her in a plain browband and masqueraded as a hunter where she was 2nd to a proper hunter mare and rightfully so. Her colt by Dazzler won ! Liz May's coloured filly by Lostock Huntsman followed her Devon County win by winning her class and standing Champion over the ridden horse. Fantastic. Another of Langaller's progeny Sue Simpson's Darius by C Dazzler won his class and stood res Champion led hunter. default.jpg Totnes 2008
15 2018-08-08 Dunster is another of our favourite local shows. many of our smaller shows have fallen foul of the weather but Dunster is on a very level and well drained polo field and despite having to be pulled in the going was excellent. Eve'n Keel won the led hunter Championship remaining unbeaten bar once this season. Endeavour won her Riding Horse broodmare class as did her foal. 3 horses, 3 wins. The winner of the 3 year old coloured class was Mrs Lamble's gelding by Lostock Huntsman. Congratulations to her. default.jpg Dunster 2008
16 2018-08-08 Although we didn't show our own horses this year, Liz May's coloured filly by Lostock Huntsman followed her Devon County win and her Totnes Show Championship by standing a very creditable 2nd in her 1,2,and 3 year old class. Sue Simpson's Darius by C Dazzler followed his Totnes form by again winning his 2 year old class and standing Res Champion default.jpg Honiton 2008
17 2018-08-08 Although we didn't go to the show ourselves we are thrilled to report that Sue Simpson's horse Jazz Band bred by us by Bandmaster out of our old show mare Holly VII won his lightweight hunter class duly claiming his HOYS ticket. A fantastic result for  a true amature ! default.jpg New Forest 2008

625 0000-00-00 The narrator is a young governess, sent off to a country house to take charge of two orphaned children. She finds a pleasant house and a comfortable housekeeper, while the children are beautiful and charming. But she soon begins to feel the presence of intense evil. 

A big disappointment for me.  Overlong, convoluted and in parts so very boring.  It didn't hold my interest and was a struggle to even read 100+ pages. Watch 'The Others'on DVD.  It's similar (I think!!) screw.jpg The Turn of the Screw by Henry James FALSE YOUNGPEOPLEBOOKS Book We've Recently Read
626 0000-00-00 The Closers puts Harry Bosch back in the Los Angelese Police Department, where he was meant to be, and sets him to solving old cases, which is what he always did best, alongside Kiz Rider, who was always the best of the partners fate, and Connolly, gave him. They are working on the death of a bi-racial teenager back in the 1980s, abducted from her bedroom and shot dead. The racial tensions of the time are clearly a factor - the DNA of a known racist is trapped in blood on the gun - but in a Michael Connolly novel, things are never as simple as they seem. And Bosch finds, not to his especial surprise, that he has been asked back into the LAPD as someone's weapon in the dance of departmental politics. The death of Backy Verloren was a tragedy - the investigation of her murder was a series of mistakes that left her father an alcoholic mess and her mother an obsessive trapped in the past, and someone profited by their misery. Connolly is always at his best when Harry is caught up in the problems of other people, rather than his own, and this excellent, twisty police procedural is a snappy return to form. closers.jpg The Closers by Michael Connelly FALSE YOUNGPEOPLEBOOKS Book We've Recently Read
627 0000-00-00 Pigs might not fly but they are strangely altered. So, for that matter, are wolves and racoons. A man, once named Jimmy, lives in a tree, wrapped in old bedsheets, now calls himself Snowman. The voice of Oryx, the woman he loved, teasingly haunts him. And the green-eyed Children of Crake are, for some reason, his responsibility. 'In Jimmy, Atwood has created a great character: a tragic-comic artist of the future, part buffoon, part Orpheus. An adman who's a sad man; a jealous lover who's in perpetual mourning; a fantasist who can only remember the past' - Independent 

I really think I am missing something with all these prizewinning or literary bestsellers.  Maybe I am reading far too much into it or I'm too stupid to understand what the author is trying to say.  However, I did enjoy the story's prmise and the ensuing tale but still feel I have 'missed' something. oryx.jpg Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood FALSE YOUNGPEOPLEBOOKS Book We've Recently Read
628 0000-00-00 What is the Third Secret? It is rumoured to be a prediction so shocking that it has been locked away for over 80 years. But when it is finally revealed in 2000, it seems puzzling, less than sensational. Is something being held back? Could this be what is drawing Pope Clement XV to the Vatican archive, night after sleepless night? When Father Colin Michener is sent on a secret mission to the highlands of Romania, he is pitched into a vortex of suspicion, deceit, murder and forbidden passion. Suddenly, he is forced to face the very thing that has so distressed the Pope - and to unravel a mystery that will shake the world. 

A better writer than Dan Brown, Berry still has to convince me that his books are more gripping rather than run-of-the-mill thrillers.  In an already crowded market, I think he has a way to go yet I will try and persevere with Berry.................. secret.jpg The Third Secert by Steve Berry FALSE YOUNGPEOPLEBOOKS Book We've Recently Read
629 0000-00-00 Deep in the City something had been woken, so old that people had been walking past it for centuries without giving it a second look!' When George breaks the dragon's head outside the Natural History Museum he awakes an ancient power. This prehistoric beast, sentry-still for centuries, hunts him down with a terrifying wrath. And this is just the beginning! The taints and spits -- statues with opposing natures -- are warring forces; wreaking deadly havoc on the city landscape. The World War One gunner offers protection of sorts; and the wisdom of the Sphinx is legendary. But George and his companion Edie are trapped in a world of danger. And worse -- they are quite alone. The rest of London is oblivious to their plight. This epic adventure exposes forces long-layered in the fabric of London. After entering its richly original and breathtaking world, the city streets and skyline will never again seem the same!

A great new fantasy that blends modern storytelling in the real world where another world of fantasy and danger lives just below the surface.  A good book if ever you are talking about london and even better if you have ever lived there. sherat.jpg Stoneheart by Charlie Fletcher FALSE YOUNGPEOPLEBOOKS Book We've Recently Read
630 0000-00-00 Classified as historical fiction, gothic horror story, and bildungsroman, this novel tells the story of a woman who murders her daughter to protect her from the living hell of slavery. Told in flashbacks, memories, and nightmares, the story is very difficult to follow.  There are some wonderful chapters and characters that seem to flow in and out of the story and then there are others that make you wonder if you are reading the same book!! loved.jpg Beloved by Toni Morrison FALSE YOUNGPEOPLEBOOKS Book We've Recently Read
631 0000-00-00 More than fulfilling the promise of Huston's 2004 debut, Caught Stealing, this remarkably assured hard-boiled caper has rapid-fire pacing, dead-on dialogue and a beleaguered protagonist who just can't get a break. Former minor league baseball player Hank Thompson barely escaped with his life at the end of Caught, making off with $4 million of the Russian mafia's money. Several years later, he's running a breakfast place in the Yucatan, down the shore from his secluded hut. When a Russian bounty hunter shows up asking questions, Hank Fed-Exes his bankroll to a friend in Las Vegas and sneaks north across the border. When not trying to kill him, two surf bum criminals convince him they're allies; as the book reaches its climax, Hank finds himself dodging a memorable cast of lowlifes, would-be mobsters and scammers.

Brilliant!!! six.jpg Six Bad Things by Charlie Huston FALSE YOUNGPEOPLEBOOKS Book We've Recently Read
632 0000-00-00 Huston doesn't let his battered, tormented protagonist rest for one moment in the exciting final volume of his trilogy featuring Henry "Hank" Thompson, now an unwilling hit man for David Dolokhov, the Russian mobster whose $4 million he stole (and lost) in 2005's Six Bad Things. With a botched plastic surgery job that's left him disfigured and in chronic pain, Hank is only able to deal with his nightmares about the people he's killed with handfuls of prescription painkillers. He's on the verge of slipping under when Dolokhov assigns him to protect Miguel Arenas, a rising young baseball star and gambling addict who also owes the Russian a big chunk of change. Hank is forced to confront his own past as a former minor league player as his bodyguard gig takes him to New York, where his misadventures began. While the book drags a bit in the middle, the pace picks up toward the end as Hank finds himself once again doing what he does best, running for his life.

Rarely do I read two books on the bounce by the same author but I cannot recommend Huston's books highly enough. dangerous.jpg A Dangerous Man by Charlie Huston FALSE YOUNGPEOPLEBOOKS Book We've Recently Read
633 0000-00-00 Captain Titus Oates, hero of the Antarctic, has been dead for nearly a century. But not in Sym's head. In there, he is her constant companion, her soulmate, her adviser. It is as if he walked out of the Polar blizzard and into her mind. In fact, if it were not for Titus, life might be as bleak a place as the Antarctic wilderness. When she is taken on a mystery expedition by her eccentric uncle Victor, Sym can't believe her luck. Destination Antarctica-the very place she's always
wanted to visit. But Victor has other plans, more sinister than Sym could possibly imagine. Stranded in the most isolated part of the world with her trust in someone she comes to realize is a madman, she must find a way to avoid a gruesome fate. But what should a teenage girl do? Could it be that Titus, the one who perished in that very place, will be the means of her survival?

Stick with this one through the first few chapters as this is not what you expect it to be.  A rewarding and unusual read for teens. darkness.jpg The White Darkness by Geraldine MacCaughrean FALSE YOUNGPEOPLEBOOKS Book We've Recently Read
634 0000-00-00 "Crime and Punishment", based on Dostoevsky's own experience of the justice and penal system of Tsarist Russia, is a dark tale set in the dingy streets of St Petersburg, concerning the actions of a murderer who decides to commit homicide as a matter of principle.

A book I was not looking forward to reading.  It is a long and difficult read but I was surprised at how much I liked the book and at the resonance that the book has in the world today. crime.jpg Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky FALSE YOUNGPEOPLEBOOKS Book We've Recently Read

Matt Fiddes is a dynamic 27 year old martial arts Master and father of three.

His chain of martial arts clubs is the biggest and most progressive in the UK and Europe. Matt Fiddes Martial Arts offers an exciting blend of Kickboxing, Tae Kwon Do and Kung Fu disciplines, in a fun non-combative educational programme, which helps the pupil learn self-reliance, respect and discipline.

Matt Fiddes, now a 5th degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Matt has worked hard, since being a young teenager, at developing his programme to give positive benefit to adults and children.

In a world of apparent declining standards and failing discipline, the Matt Fiddes programme is hailed by parents, who see their children growing as self-reliant people, showing respect and consideration to those around them  and with the ability to say No' to drugs and bullying. Schools and MPs also support the Matt Fiddes programmes.

Adult members of his Schools appreciate the respect which is engendered within the School atmosphere, as they pursue improved fitness levels or weight loss, while developing their own self-reliance, and ability to defend themselves.

Matt Fiddes unique contribution to fitness and personality development has made him a frequent guest on TV and in national magazines.

He is a close friend of celebrity star Uri Geller, with whom he has produced motivational videos. Pop star Belinda Carlisle is also a supporter of his organisation, having initially been involved with the Matt Fiddes anti-bullying campaign.

The Matt Fiddes Adults Kickboxing and Martial arts programme is designed to benefit the students in many ways. You will benefit from increased Muscle Tone, Flexibility, Strength, Confidence, Weight loss, Self Defence and much much more. The Matt Fiddes classes are a great way to meet new people who have similar goals of getting in shape and one day achieving a Black Belt. 

<b>The importance of self-defence </b>

We teach all students to be safe by using a common sense approach to protection. This means understanding self-defence techniques, self-defence strategy, and conflict resolution techniques. We also teach body language concepts to our students. The way you make eye contact with somebody, and the way you use your voice. We now live in such a world that it is vital that we learn how to defend ourselves. Self-defence is very important as one day it could save your life! 

<b>A great way to lose weight and keep fit </b>

Lets face it, we have at one time joined a gym, started aerobics, and maybe bought the exercise video? But I bet that the majority of you who are reading this page have not reached your fitness and weight loss goals yet? Why our Kickboxing and martial arts programme has been so successful in helping men and women lose weight and achieve their dream body shapes is for a number of reasons. 

<b>1.</b> The Matt Fiddes programme is fun and exciting. Every class you take at a Matt Fiddes martial arts school will be different than the last. You will always learn something new. Gyms, and aerobics and videos become very repetitive and after a while most people drop out. The amount of students who stick with us is unbelievable and this is because we offer a fun alternative to getting fit and in shape. 

<b>2.</b> You train in our classes at your own pace - Our Classes are split into three levels: 

<ul><li>Beginner programme (Basic)</li>
<li>Intermediate Programme (Black Belt Club) </li>
<li>Advanced Programme (Masters Club) </li>
<li>Leadership Programme (Mixed ability)</li></ul>
This means that everyone in your class is in the same situation as yourself. You will not be thrown in a class with a bunch of Black Belts like many other martial arts organisations practice. We are professionals and believe in doing everything we can to help you reach your goals easily and safely. You will only be expected to train to your own level and the instructor will pacifically adjust the class to the student's needs. 

<b>3.</b> The Matt Fiddes staff are experienced and are there to motivate you to reach your goals. At the Matt Fiddes Martial arts Schools we pride ourselves in having a fully trained highly qualified team of instructors. They are there to coach you and advise you in everyway to help you achieve your goals within our programmes. The Instructors attend regular course's to keep their martial arts and Kickboxing skills and teaching methods up to the high standard required by Mr Fiddes. 

<b>The positive mental benefits </b>

Aside from the physical benefits you gain from the Matt Fiddes programme, there are many mental benefits such as; Self-Control, Self-Confidence, Positive thinking, Communication skills, Goal setting, Perseverance, Courage, increased motivation, increased level of focus, reduced stress levels and much much more. 

<b>Our programme has it all! </b>

When you combine all of theses area's you can see that our Adults programme has it all. We believe that you will never find another fitness and martial arts programme to match the many benefits you can receive from our award winning martial arts schools. 

Find out for yourself and call the Matt Fiddes enrollment office on 0800 0354660 to take advantage of this month's special offer. <b>Karate is the best thing you can do for your child </b>

The Matt Fiddes children's classes teach the number one children's programme in the country. The Matt Fiddes classes work hand in hand with a childs schoolwork, providing improved self-discipline, self-confidence, concentration, mental alertness, co-operation, goal setting advice and anti bully skills. Young people are taught at the Matt Fiddes Martial arts Schools that through dedicated, intense work, all worthwhile goals in life are possible. Parents have attributed our programme with improved school grades as a direct result of the increased achievement motivation, self-direction and self-confidence provided by the programme. 

<b>Working with the Local Schools</b>

We see ourselves as educators and not just martial arts teachers. We run "schools" and not "clubs." We try and build a relationship up with your Childs academic schoolteacher as we are all working towards the same goal of building your child a successful future. 

All young students in our children's programme are required to take a specially designed form to their teachers at School once a month. This has to be signed off by the teacher before the student can be considered to be put forward for an exam to take them to their next grade. 

Also the form needs to be signed by the parents to show that they are being well behaved and are showing respect at home! 

The goal is to make sure those educational values that we teach in our martial arts classes are used in all areas of their life. 

One thing they are taught though is that the physical side of what we teach them should only ever be used in a self-defence situation. This is something that we are very strict on and it is constantly stressed to all students that Martial arts skills require them never to be abusive or offensive and is only to be used defensively. 

<b>Courage. </b>

At the Matt Fiddes Martial Arts Schools our students find the courage to move outside of their comfort zone. We teach our students that they can always do better by setting and achieving new goals they will themselves, take on more difficult karate moves and skills. They will see their lives as a constant journey of improvement. Our members will refuse to become a victim of fate. In short, with a deep breath, they refuse to become a victim of fate. They learn to create their own destiny and future. 

<b>Staying power. </b>

The Matt Fiddes students find joy in improving their physical stamina. They will learn to also think in a positive way and never to give up on any task. Our students are taught to practice skills until they get them right, and never give up! They strive harder and longer to reach goals. Even if at first they fail, they persevere until they get to where they want to be. The they will not let self doubt or dream stealers get in the way of their own personal progress and future. 

<b>Powerful Self-control</b>

Our members will refuse to give up to negative peer pressure and give up. They are taught to respect parents, teachers and the law. They are taught what is right and what is wrong through our life skills programme. Self-control is a major skill for a child to learn and live with in order to become a Black Belt at the Matt Fiddes Martial arts Schools 

<b>Improved Focus. </b>

They'll learn what's needed, along with the skill to "zero in" on critical tasks at hand. Normal, yet time-wasting, childhood distractions won't get in the way of there success! 

<b>Fearless Self-Confidence. </b>

Watch as your child finds the courage to open any door life has to offer. Your child will develop the I can do anything attitude. 

<b>Goal Setting. </b>

Setting goals is the "road map" of life. It has been said that "If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail." On the road towards a Black Belt, the Matt Fiddes student gains the experience and motivation for success by earning progressively higher belt grades. Success is the reward for goal setting. 

<b>Self-defence</b>

And of course they will learn effective and powerful self-defence skills, (after all, we are a Karate School), as well as the fundamental attitudes appropriate to those tools. We will teach your child effective safety skills such as our Stranger Danger programme. 

<b>Black Belt is our Goal</b>

It is important for each child to learn to set short-term, intermediate, and long-term goals. At the Matt Fiddes Martial Arts schools every students goal is Black Belt and beyond. Black belt is a symbol of excellence in martial arts and an important tool for instructors and parents to use for developing desire, determination and for teaching the importance of follow-through in any activity. Our students are taught never to give up at any given task and that they can do anything as long as they just put their mind to it. 

<b>Towering Role-Model Teachers. </b>

As you might guess, all of this couldn't have happened unless we had the very best teachers. To make sure we have the very best, each of our teachers have years of experience in our system and has been thoroughly trained in positive teaching methods. All our Instructors have monthly specialised training in order to keep up with the latest teacher techniques and advancements at the Matt Fiddes Martial Arts Schools.

MATT FIDDES MARTIAL ARTS SCHULEN - die  wettkampffreie und effektive Kampfkunst, die einen DYNAMISCHEN neuen LEBENSSTIL anbietet. default.jpg default.jpg FALSE FALSE Matt Fiddes Akademien, Karate, Taekwondo und Kickboxing HOME INFO NACHRICHTEN SCHULEN STUDENTEN PROGRAMME GALERIE KONTAKT US LINKS ÜBER MATT FIDDES TESTIMONIALS ERWACHSENE JUNIOR ALTER 7-12 MIGHTY MATTS ALTER 4-6 MF NACHRICHTEN SCHLAGZEILEN Matt Fiddes ist ein 27 Jahre alter Martial Arts Meister und Vater von 3 Kindern.

Seine Kette von Martial Arts Schulen ist die größte und schnellstwachsende  in Grossbritannien und Europa, welche eine einmalige Mischung aus  Kickboxing, Tae Kwon Do und Kung Fu Disziplinen in einem Spass machenden pädagogischen Konzept ohne physischen Kontakt anbietet. Dieses hilft Schülern Selbständigkeit, Respekt und Disziplin zu lernen.

Jetzt hat er einen schwarzen Gürtel 5ten Grades, in Tae Kwon Do. Matt hat (seit er ein Teenager war) hart daran gearbeitet ein Programm zu entwickeln, von dem sowohl Erwachsene als auch Kinder profitieren.

In einer Welt von sinkenden Wertvorstellungen und ohne Disziplin wird sein Programm von Eltern gelobt, die ihre Kinder als selbständige Personen heranwachsen sehen möchten. Kinder die Respekt und Rücksicht für andere zeigen, und die die Fähigkeit besitzen Nein zu sagen zu Drogen und Gruppenzwang. Sein außergewöhnliches Programm wird sogar von Schulen und Ministerien unterstützt.

Erwachsene Mitglieder seiner Schulen schätzen den Respekt, der innerhalb der Schulen gezeigt wird, während sie daran arbeiten ihre Fitness zu steigern oder Gewicht zu verlieren. Zur selben Zeit entwickeln sie ein gesundes Selbstbewusstsein und die Fähigkeit sich zu verteidigen.

Matts einzigartiger Beitrag zu Fitness und Persönlichkeitsentwicklung hat ihn zu einem häufigen Gast im Fernsehen und nationalen Zeitschriften gemacht.

Er ist ein guter Freund von Uri Geller, mit welchem er Motivations Videos produziert hat. Auch Popstar Belinda Carlisle unterstützt seine Organisation, nachdem sie zunächst an Matts Anti-Konflikt Kampagne beteiligt war.

Das Bild rechts zeigt den internationalen Star Uri Geller und Kinderstar Mark Lester, welche Paten zu Martial Arts Meister Matt Fiddes Tochter Madison sind, anlässlich der Taufe am 10ten Mai. Die Taufe fand in einer Glasspyramide auf Gellers millionenschwerem Anwesen in Berkshire in England statt.

Geller und Fiddes sind seit über 7 Jahren sehr gute Freunde, nachdem sie zusammen ein Fitness Video gemacht hatten. Beide sind auch eng mit Pop Superstar Michael Jackson befreundet. Michael Jackson war es auch der Matt Mark Lester (von Oliver Twist) vorstellte. Lester ist auch der Pate von Michael Jacksons Kindern, Prince und Paris Jackson.

Die Matt Fiddes Martial Arts Schulen lehren ein sehr erfolgreiches und beliebtes Erwachsenen Martial Arts Programm.

Unser Erwachsenen Kickboxing und Martial Arts Programm ist darauf ausgerichtet den Mitgliedern in vielen Bereichen zu nutzen. Sie werden von gesteigerter Muskelspannung, Flexibilität, Kraft, Selbstbewusstsein, Gewichtsverlust, Selbstverteidigung und vielem mehr profitieren. Unsere Klassen sind ebenso eine gute Möglichkeit neue Leute kennen zu lernen, die ähnliche Ziele wie sie haben, wie z.B. fit zu werden und eines Tages einen schwarzen Gürtel zu tragen.

<b>Die Bedeutung von Selbstverteidigung</b>

Wir lehren allen Studenten durch einen gesunden Menschenverstand sicher durchs Leben zu gehen. Das bedeutet auch das Erlernen von Selbstverteidigungs-Techniken, Selbstverteidigungs-Strategieen, und Konfliktlösungs-Techniken. Unsere Studenten lernen auch die Prinzipien der Körpersprache. Wie man Augenkontakt mit jemandem hält, und wie man seine Stimme richtig nutzt. Wir leben in einer Welt, in der es eine Notwendigkeit ist Selbstverteidigung zu lernen. Selbstverteidigung ist sehr wichtig, da es eines Tages ihr Leben retten kann!

<b>Eine tolle Art Gewicht zu verlieren und fit zu werden</b>

Mal ehrlich gesagt, jeder ist wohl mal einem Fitnessstudio beigetreten, hat Aerobics gemacht, oder vielleicht ein Fitness Video gekauft. Aber ich wette, das die Mehrzahl von ihnen die diese Seite lesen ihr Ziel von Fitness und Gewichtsverlust noch nicht erreicht haben. Warum gerade unser Kickboxing und Martial Arts Programm so erfolgreich ist, Männern und Frauen zu helfen Gewicht zu verlieren und ihren Traumkörper zu bekommen, hat verschiedene Gründe.

1. Unser Programm macht Spass und ist aufregend. Jede Unterrichtsstunde an einer Matt Fiddes Martial Arts Schule ist anders als die vorhergehende. Sie werden immer etwas neues lernen. Fitness Studios, und Aerobics Videos sind voller Wiederholungen und nach einer Weile geben viele Leute auf. Der Anteil der Mitglieder, die bei uns bleiben ist unglaublich groß und kommt daher das wir eine Alternative zu Fitness anbieten die SPASS macht.

2. Sie tranieren in unseren Klassen nach ihrem eigenen Tempo. Unsere Klassen sind in 3 Ebenen geteilt.
	Einsteiger (grundlegend)
	Fortgeschrittene (Schwarzgurt Club)
	Profi Programm (Meister Club)
	intensives und extensives programm (Leadership)

Das bedeutet, das jeder in Ihrer Klasse in der gleichen Situation wie Sie selber ist. Wir werden Sie nicht in eine Klasse voller Schwarzer Gürtel stecken, wie es die Praktik in vielen anderen Martial Arts Schulen ist. Wir sind Professionell und glauben, dass wir alles tun müssen um Ihnen zu helfen ihre Ziele so einfach und sicher wie möglich zu erreichen. Von Ihnen wird nur erwartet, das Sie nach Ihrem eigenen Vermögen trainieren. Der Instructor wird die Stunde somit nach dem Möglichkeiten der Schüler gestalten.

3. Unser Personal ist erfahren und dazu da Sie zu motivieren um ihr Ziel zu erreichen. In den Matt Fiddes Martial Arts Schulen sind wir stolz darauf ein hochqualifiziertes Team von Instructoren zu haben. Diese haben die Aufgabe Sie zu trainieren und ihnen jederzeit zu helfen Ihr Ziel innerhalb unserer Programme zu erreichen. Die Lehrer besuchen regelmäßig Kurse um Ihre Martial Arts und Kickboxing Fähigkeiten und Lehrmethoden auf dem hohen Niveau zu halten, welches Master Fiddes erwartet.

<b>Die positiven geistigen Vorteile</b>
Neben den physischen Vorteilen die sie von unserem Programm erhalten, sind auch viele geistige Vorteile. Hierzu gehören z. B. Selbstkontrolle, Selbstbewusstsein, positives Denken, kommunikative Fähigkeiten, Zielsetzung, Ausdauer, Mut, gesteigerte Motivation, gesteigerte Konzentration, reduzierter Stress und vieles mehr.

Unser Programm bietet das alles!
Wenn Sie alle diese Vorteile vereinen ist es klar zu sehen, das unser Erwachsenen Programm alles hat. Wir sind sicher, dass Sie kein anderes Fitness und Martial Arts Programm finden, das alle diese Vorteile bietet, die Sie von unserem Programm erhalten. <b>JUNIOR PROGRAMM (7 BIS 11 JAHRE)</b>

<b><i>Karate ist die beste Sache die sie fuer ihr Kind tun können</i></b>

In unsere Kinderklassen lehren wir das Nummer 1 Programm in Europa. Unsere Klassen arbeiten hand in hand mit den Schulen Ihres Kindes. Es verbessert ihre Selbstdisziplin, Selbstsicherheit, Konzentration, geistige Fitness, Kooperationsfähhigkeit, Zielsetzung und Konfliktvermeidung.  Jungen Menschen wird an den Matt Fiddes Martial Arts Schulen gelehrt, dass durch engagierte, intensive Arbeit jedes Ziel im Leben verwirklicht werden kann. Eltern haben es, als ein direktes Resultat, unserem Programm zugeschrieben, das Ihre Kinder verbesserte Noten in der Schule haben. Dies kommt von der gewachsenen Motivation, mehr Selbstdisziplin und mehr Selbstsicherheit die wir in unseren Schulen lehren. Wir treten ein für ein Leben ohne Drogen.

Zusammenarbeit mit den örtlichen Schulen.
Wir sehen uns als Ausbilder, nicht nur als Martial Art Instructoren. Wir sind eine Schule kein Club. Wir versuchen eine Beziehung zu dem Schullehrer Ihrer Kinder aufzubauen, da wir alle zusammen daran arbeiten, dass Ihr Kind eine erfolgreiche Zukunft hat.

Alle unsere jungen Schüler in unserem Kinder Programm müssen einmal im Monat ein besonderes Formular zu ihrem Lehrer bringen. Dieses muss von dem Lehrer unterschrieben werden,  bevor der Schüler für eine Prüfung berücksichtigt wird, die ihm zu seinem nächsten Gürtel-Grad verhilft.

Auch die Eltern müssen dieses Formular unterschreiben um zu bestätigen, dass das Kind sich zu Hause gut benimmt und sich respektvoll verhält.
Das Ziel dieser Formulare ist es, sicher zu stellen, das die Werte, die wir in der Martial Arts Klasse lehren, auch in allen anderen Bereichen des Lebens genutzt werden.

Eine Sache die wir besonders betonen ist, das die physische Seite, die wir ihnen in Martial Arts beibringen, nur in einer Selbstverteidigungs-Situation genutzt werden darf. Dies ist eine Sache in der wir besonders streng sind und so wird es den Kindern immer wieder beigebracht, das Martial Arts Fähigkeiten niemals missbraucht werden dürfen oder das sie niemals jemanden verletzen dürfen. Sie dienen nur zur Verteidigung.

Mut
An den Matt Fiddes Martial Arts Schulen finden unsere Schüler den Mut, aus Ihrer Comfort-Zone auszubrechen. Wir lehren unseren Schülern, dass sie immer besser werden, indem sie sich selbst Ziele setzen und diese auch erreichen. So meistern sie schwierigere Karate Bewegungen und Fähigkeiten. Sie werden ihr Leben als eine ständige Reise für Verbesserungen sehen. Unsere Mitglieder werden kein Opfer des Zufalls sein. Sie lernen ihre eigene Zukunft und ihr Schicksal selbst zu gestalten.

Durchhaltevermögen
Unsere Studenten haben Spaß daran, körperliche Ausdauer zu verbessern. Sie lernen in einer positiven Weise zu denken und niemals bei einer Aufgabe aufzugeben. Unseren Schülern wird gelehrt,  ihre Fähigkeiten zu trainieren bis sie richtig sind und niemals aufzugeben! Sie arbeiten härter und länger um ihr Ziel zu erreichen. Selbst wenn sie es nicht gleich in den Griff bekommen, sie halten durch, bis sie es richtig machen. Weder Selbstzweifel noch Skeptiker werden sich ihrem persönlichen Ziel in den Weg stellen können.

Starke Selbstkontrolle
Unsere Mitglieder werden negativem Druck von Gleichaltrigen widerstehen und nicht aufgeben. Ihnen wird gelehrt Eltern, Lehrer und das Gesetz zu achten. Ihnen wird  beigebracht, was richtig und was falsch ist. Selbstkontrolle zu lernen, ist eine der wichtigsten Fähigkeiten für ein Kind um ein geregeltes Leben zu führen und um ein Schwarzgurt an den Matt Fiddes Martial Arts Schulen zu werden.

Verbesserter Fokus
Sie werden lernen, was sie benötigen um sich auf eine schwierige Aufgabe zu konzentrieren. Normale, jedoch zeitraubende, kindliche Ablenkungen werden den Weg zu ihrem Erfolg nicht stören.


Furchtloses Selbstvertrauen
Sehen Sie wie ihr Kind den Mut findet jede Tür die das Leben bietet, zu öffnen. Ihr Kind wird die Ich kann alles erreichen Haltung bekommen.

Zielsetzung
Zielsetzung ist die Straßenkarte des Lebens. Es wurde gesagt: Wenn Du beim Planen versagst, dann planst Du zu versagen".  Auf dem Weg zu einem Schwarzen Gürtel, erhalten die Matt Fiddes Schüler die Übung und Motivation für Erfolg indem sie progressive höhere Gürtel Ränge erhalten. Erfolg ist die Belohnung für Zielsetzung.

Selbstverteidigung
Natürlich werden sie effektive und starke Selbstverteidigungs-Fähigkeiten erlernen, (nichts desto Trotz, wir sind eine Karate Schule),  ebenso wie die fundamentale Haltung die für diese Fähigkeiten nötig ist. Wir unterrichten ihr Kind in effektivem Sicherheits-Denken, so wie in unserem Vorsicht vor Fremden Programm.

Das Ziel ist der Schwarze Gürtel
Es ist wichtig das jedes Kind kurzfristige, mittlere und langfristige Ziele setzt. Jeder Schüler an den Matt Fiddes Schulen hat den Schwarzen Gürtel und mehr als Ziel. Der Schwarze Gürtel ist ein Symbol von Exzellenz in den Martial Arts und ein wichtiges Werkzeug für Lehrer und Eltern, um das Verlangen und die Entschlossenheit zu entwickeln. Er vermittelt die Wichtigkeit nicht aufzugeben was auch immer es sei. Unsere Studenten werden gelehrt niemals aufzugeben und das sie alles können, so lange sie sich auf ihr Ziel konzentrieren.

Rollenmodell Lehrer
Wie sie vielleicht vorausgesehen haben, all dies könnte nicht stattfinden, wenn wir nicht hervorragende Lehrer hätten. Um sicher zu sein, dass wir die bestmöglichen Lehrer haben, haben unsere Lehrer langjährige Erfahrung in unserem System und wurden gründlich ausgebildet in positiven Lehrmethoden. Alle unsere Lehrer unterliegen einem monatlichen Trainingsprogramm, um mit den neuesten Lehrmethoden auf dem laufenden zu sein.

Kostenlose Schüler-Eltern Beratung. Bevor der Unterricht Ihres Kindes beginnt, werden wir uns mit Ihnen treffen, um die Bedürfnisse ihres Kindes und seine Entwicklung zu diskutieren. Wir werden Ihnen unser Programm erklären und Ihnen helfen, den Entwicklungsprozess für ihr Kind zu verstehen. Wir werden ihnen Tipps geben wie sie die Entwicklung ihres Kindes positiv beeinflussen können, indem sie ein Mitglied in unserer Schule werden. <b>MIGHTY MATTS PROGRAMM (4 BIS 6 JAHRE)</b>

Matt Fiddes, now a 5th degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Matt has worked hard, since being a young teenager, at developing his programme to give positive benefit to adults and children.

In a world of apparent declining standards and failing discipline, the Matt Fiddes programme is hailed by parents, who see their children growing as self-reliant people, showing respect and consideration to those around them  and with the ability to say No' to drugs and bullying. Schools and MPs also support the Matt Fiddes programmes.

Adult members of his Schools appreciate the respect which is engendered within the School atmosphere, as they pursue improved fitness levels or weight loss, while developing their own self-reliance, and ability to defend themselves.

Matt Fiddes unique contribution to fitness and personality development has made him a frequent guest on TV and in national magazines.

He is a close friend of celebrity star Uri Geller, with whom he has produced motivational videos. Pop star Belinda Carlisle is also a supporter of his organisation, having initially been involved with the Matt Fiddes anti-bullying campaign.

Uri Geller and Matt Fiddes have been close friends for over 8 years after making a fitness video together and forming a close friendship with pop superstar Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson introduced Mark Lester (from Oliver Twist fame) to Matt Fiddes. Lester is also godfather to Michael Jackson's children, Prince and Paris Jackson.

The Matt Fiddes Adults Kickboxing and Martial arts programme is designed to benefit the students in many ways. You will benefit from increased Muscle Tone, Flexibility, Strength, Confidence, Weight loss, Self Defence and much much more. The Matt Fiddes classes are a great way to meet new people who have similar goals of getting in shape and one day achieving a Black Belt. 

<b>The importance of self-defence </b>

We teach all students to be safe by using a common sense approach to protection. This means understanding self-defence techniques, self-defence strategy, and conflict resolution techniques. We also teach body language concepts to our students. The way you make eye contact with somebody, and the way you use your voice. We now live in such a world that it is vital that we learn how to defend ourselves. Self-defence is very important as one day it could save your life! 

<b>A great way to lose weight and keep fit </b>

Lets face it, we have at one time joined a gym, started aerobics, and maybe bought the exercise video? But I bet that the majority of you who are reading this page have not reached your fitness and weight loss goals yet? Why our Kickboxing and martial arts programme has been so successful in helping men and women lose weight and achieve their dream body shapes is for a number of reasons. 

<b>1.</b> The Matt Fiddes programme is fun and exciting. Every class you take at a Matt Fiddes martial arts school will be different than the last. You will always learn something new. Gyms, and aerobics and videos become very repetitive and after a while most people drop out. The amount of students who stick with us is unbelievable and this is because we offer a fun alternative to getting fit and in shape. 

<b>2.</b> You train in our classes at your own pace - Our Classes are split into three levels: 

<ul><li>Beginner programme (Basic)</li>
<li>Intermediate Programme (Black Belt Club) </li>
<li>Advanced Programme (Masters Club) </li>
<li>Leadership Programme (Mixed ability)</li></ul>
This means that everyone in your class is in the same situation as yourself. You will not be thrown in a class with a bunch of Black Belts like many other martial arts organisations practice. We are professionals and believe in doing everything we can to help you reach your goals easily and safely. You will only be expected to train to your own level and the instructor will pacifically adjust the class to the student's needs. 

<b>3.</b> The Matt Fiddes staff are experienced and are there to motivate you to reach your goals. At the Matt Fiddes Martial arts Schools we pride ourselves in having a fully trained highly qualified team of instructors. They are there to coach you and advise you in everyway to help you achieve your goals within our programmes.

<b>The positive mental benefits </b>

<b>Our programme has it all! </b>

When you combine all of theses area's you can see that our Adults programme has it all. We believe that you will never find another fitness and martial arts programme to match the many benefits you can receive from our award winning martial arts schools. 

Find out for yourself and call the Matt Fiddes enrollment office on 0800 0354660 to take advantage of this month's special offer. <b>Karate is the best thing you can do for your child </b>

The Matt Fiddes children's classes teach the number one children's programme in the country. The Matt Fiddes classes work hand in hand with a childs schoolwork, providing improved self-discipline, self-confidence, concentration, mental alertness, co-operation, goal setting advice and anti bully skills. Young people are taught at the Matt Fiddes Martial arts Schools that through dedicated, intense work, all worthwhile goals in life are possible. Parents have attributed our programme with improved school grades as a direct result of the increased achievement motivation, self-direction and self-confidence provided by the programme. 

<b>Working with the Local Schools</b>

We see ourselves as educators and not just martial arts teachers. We run "schools" and not "clubs." We try and build a relationship up with your Childs academic schoolteacher as we are all working towards the same goal of building your child a successful future. 

All young students in our children's programme are required to take a specially designed form to their teachers at School once a month. This has to be signed off by the teacher before the student can be considered to be put forward for an exam to take them to their next grade. 

Also the form needs to be signed by the parents to show that they are being well behaved and are showing respect at home! 

The goal is to make sure those educational values that we teach in our martial arts classes are used in all areas of their life. 

One thing they are taught though is that the physical side of what we teach them should only ever be used in a self-defence situation. This is something that we are very strict on and it is constantly stressed to all students that Martial arts skills require them never to be abusive or offensive and is only to be used defensively. 

<b>Courage. </b>

At the Matt Fiddes Martial Arts Schools our students find the courage to move outside of their comfort zone. We teach our students that they can always do better by setting and achieving new goals they will themselves, take on more difficult karate moves and skills. They will see their lives as a constant journey of improvement. Our members will refuse to become a victim of fate. In short, with a deep breath, they refuse to become a victim of fate. They learn to create their own destiny and future. 

<b>Staying power. </b>

The Matt Fiddes students find joy in improving their physical stamina. They will learn to also think in a positive way and never to give up on any task. Our students are taught to practice skills until they get them right, and never give up! They strive harder and longer to reach goals. Even if at first they fail, they persevere until they get to where they want to be. The they will not let self doubt or dream stealers get in the way of their own personal progress and future. 

<b>Powerful Self-control</b>

They are taught what is right and what is wrong through our life skills programme. Self-control is a major skill for a child to learn and live with in order to become a Black Belt at the Matt Fiddes Martial arts Schools 

<b>Improved Focus. </b>

They'll learn what's needed, along with the skill to "zero in" on critical tasks at hand. Normal, yet time-wasting, childhood distractions won't get in the way of there success! 

<b>Fearless Self-Confidence. </b>

Watch as your child finds the courage to open any door life has to offer. Your child will develop the I can do anything attitude. 

<b>Goal Setting. </b>

Setting goals is the "road map" of life. It has been said that "If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail." On the road towards a Black Belt, the Matt Fiddes student gains the experience and motivation for success by earning progressively higher belt grades. Success is the reward for goal setting. 

<b>Self-defence</b>

And of course they will learn effective and powerful self-defence skills, (after all, we are a Karate School), as well as the fundamental attitudes appropriate to those tools. We will teach your child effective safety skills such as our Stranger Danger programme. 

<b>Black Belt is our Goal</b>

It is important for each child to learn to set short-term, intermediate, and long-term goals. At the Matt Fiddes Martial Arts schools every students goal is Black Belt and beyond. Black belt is a symbol of excellence in martial arts and an important tool for instructors and parents to use for developing desire, determination and for teaching the importance of follow-through in any activity.

8 2005-06-03 World famous celebrity Uri Geller has joined the Matt Fiddes Team. Geller is a multimillionare and a world renown motivational speaker. Geller will work closly with Matt Fiddes and Lance Gregorchuk in the European launch of the Matt Fiddes martial arts schools.

Uri Geller is the world's most investigated and celebrated paranormalist. Famous around the globe for his mind-bending psychic powers, he has led a unique life shrouded in debate, controversy and mystery. He is also related to Sigmund Freud. 

He was studied by scientists who worked with Albert EinsteIn and the world's most prestigious scientific magazine, Nature, published a paper on Uri's work at the Stanford Research Institute in the U.S.A - a unique endorsement, and an irrefutable proof that his powers are genuine. His work with the FBI and the CIA has ranged from using MindPower to erase KGB computer files and track serial killers, to attend nuclear disarmament negotiations to bombard and influence delegates with positive thought waves so that they would sign the Nuclear Arms Reduction Treaty. Uri also spoke for a group of US Senators and National Security Executives in the high-security room in the Capitol Building in Washington. For decades this aspect of his career was too confidential and controversial to discuss. 
Uri has lectured to the directors and CEOs of large multinational companies such as Novartis, Mizuno, Sony, Rolls Royce, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Hallmark and many more. He was also recently invited as a speaker to the 2004 World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, along with such dignitaries as Bill Clinton, Dick Cheney and Steve Forbes. 

A vegetarian and fervent promoter of peace, Uri has used his gifts to successfully detect oil and precious metals. This has provided him the freedom to help others. He is the motivational MindPower coach to Premier League footballers, industrialists, Formula One drivers ice skaters for the Olympics, boxers and racing cyclists, he cycles 15 miles daily on his exercise bike. 

Uri Geller is mentioned in AT LEAST 1,250 DIFFERENT books. 

Uri's artistic skills began during his early childhood. A 'pupil' of Salvador Dali, whom he knew well, Uri's drawings, paintings and artworks have been exhibited in major galleries and museums in the U.S.A., Europe, Japan and Israel. His pottery, crystals, glass and natural rock crystal jewellery creations are in great demand worldwide. Uri's drawings ARE featured on both Belinda Carlisle's and Michael Jackson's latest albums. Uri Geller has designed the logo of the most successful boy band in the world ever N*SYNC.

He has also met great artists such as Andy Warhol, Picasso, Peter Max and John Lennon, whom he befriended.

Uri's tireless dedication to charitable work led to his appointment as the Honorary Vice-President of the Royal Hospital for Children in Bristol and of the Royal Berkshire Hospital, close to his Thames-side mansion. Uri is a patron of Climb For Tibet together with the Dalai Lama . On numerous occasions, he has given awards on behalf of His Royal Highness Prince Philip - The Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace and St. James Palace and lectured at the United Nations for international delegates. He is the father of a twenty-two year old daughter and a twenty-three year-old son, the owner of three dogs and the author of fifteen best-sellers, including the novels Ella (which is being turned into a major motion picture) and Dead Cold, the latter having been listed as a contender for the Golden Dagger Award by The Times in the U.K. Franchise Seminar Saturday 4th June

I recently visited one of our school schools. I stopped in to see the Program director one evening to find him sitting in his office. I asked about appointments for that evening and he explained that the two that were scheduled had cancelled, so he basically had a free evening. I was a little confused since I consider teaching appointments only a small portion of an Program Directors responsibilities. Your Program Director needs to be Pro Active. He or she should be doing the following when not trying to sign people up, for this person is directly responsible for continually bringing business to the school -----

1. Conduct 2,4,6 week calls. Although your Instructor can do this task, they will be much more productive when done by the Program Director for the Program Director has already built up a huge amount of rapport and can easily ask for referrals. By getting referrals from new students the Program Director can easily increase the schools student base and revenue. The 2,4,6 week plan is also your system to upgrade.

2. Contact ex-students. Create a data base for your former students. During down time the Program Director should contact these people to see if anything can be done to reactivate the students. Often times ex-students what to re-start their training but feel a little apprehensive. A friendly call can often turn this around.

3. Follow up on any prospective students that didn´t show for their first class. In other words they made an appointment but never kept it.

4. Follow up on anyone who took the Level 2 procedure but didn´t enroll. Ask what can be done to get them happily involved with your school.

5. Call students that are needing upgrades to leadership from now to the end of September and make an appointment for a progress check.

6. Make your self available before and after classes to parents. Answer questions and approach parents about converting to a family membership. Give parents VIP passes to hand out to their friends and co-workers.

7. Hit the floor during white belt classes and give your new students a pat on the back. After classes ask if they received the VIP pass and if they began handing those passes to friends. Ask them if they feel they have what it takes to be a Black Belt. Schedule upgrade conferences.

8. Send your new students congratulation letters.

9. Send parents Thank You Notes - include your business card. "Dear Parent I just wanted to again Thank You for entrusting our school for your child´s martial arts education. If there is anything I can do please do not hesitate to ask."

10. Prepare your student handbooks and uniforms for future new students.

11. Place more Lead boxes. Each instructor should be responsible for 12 however the Program Director should have at least 25.

12. Make out going calls to set up birtday parties as these parties are a large part of your marketing efforts.

13. Prepare your school packs. Be sure to hand label each envelope. (these letters are on the web site under level 1)



As you can see the responsibilities for this person are very extensive. It´s a position for a self starter with lots of energy. A great program director is a "RAIN MAKER" and will make sure you never have a bad month, by consistently taking action.

9 2005-06-05 Assessing Your Strengths
Developing a business plan will require you to consider several categories. Lets begin with determining your strengths. For instance, you have a great deal of martial arts experience. Perhaps, youre well known in the martial arts arena as a first-rate instructor. In addition, youve got great organizational skills. 

List your strengths...
1) _______________________
2) _______________________
3) _______________________
4) _______________________
5) _______________________

Determine Your Weaknesses
Now, we all have weaknesses that we know might be a hindrance to the success of operating a business. For example, salesmanship may not be your strong suit. Many people have difficulty in that area. 
Selling lessons is a strategic part of running a martial arts school. Therefore, if you dont feel that you have the aptitude for that particular aspect of the business, you might consider either pursuing training in that area, or hiring a person more suited to salesmanship.
Other weaknesses may include a lack of capital, or perhaps, your school is too small to meet the goals you have set.

List any weaknesses, and then determine how to handle them effectively. (No one's watching, so be honest with yourself. Ask some others whom you trust, "What areas do you think I could work on this year?)
1) ________________________
2) ________________________
3) ________________________

Youll also want to create a list of the strengths and weaknesses of your staff members. business plan.jpg BUILD A PLAN TO SUCCEED 2 BUTLINS picture.jpg National Shutdown 8th 9th July Matt Fiddes Newsletters!!! Two new movies added to the website Karate2.jpg default.jpg default.jpg
12 2005-06-09 Addressing Your Market

Address your specific marketing potential according to the area where your school is located. For instance, do you expect to see a considerable number of families moving into the area? Is your target market easily accessible for the particular style of martial arts you are teaching? 

List the factors that affect your marketing potential in a positive manner
1) ________________________
2) ________________________
3) ________________________
4) ________________________
5) ________________________

Finally, youll want to consider those factors that affect your marketing potential in a negative manner. This would include any competition. For instance, other studios located nearby, particularly if they teach the same style. 

Youll want to make sure that the customer base in that area is large enough to accommodate your studio. Consider what your competition charges for lessons, and be aware of any major promotions they may be having.

List the factors that affect your marketing potential in a negative manner
1) _________________________
2) _________________________
3) _________________________
4) _________________________
5) _________________________

Promote And They Will Come
Another important part of creating your business plan will be to strategize your marketing and promotion ideas. Promoting your school will be one of the most important factors in your success. After all, if your potential customers dont know about you

Create a list of marketing and promotion ideas. This may include writing and distributing a series of press releases to the local media, distributing flyers, or conducting martial arts demonstrations at the local mall.

Dealing With The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly
Many people dont like to create a business plan. Not only is it time-consuming, but it forces you to look at the good, the bad, and the ugly of your particular situation. Most of us would rather ignore problems, particularly when it looks as if those problems may deter us from our ultimate goal.

In reality, the best way to success is to take the proverbial bull by the horns, and to address and solve those problems as quickly as possible so they dont keep you from reaching your goals down the road.

Once youve discovered the areas that most need your attention, its time to create a plan to deal with them. 

There are so many factors that contribute to the success of a business, and that old saying, you are only as strong as your weakest link, definitely holds true.

Therefore, take a look at the areas that need the most attention and begin prioritizing them in order of importance. 

Write down how you will handle a particular task  going so far as researching the resources that you will use to complete it. Then, put an expected completion date beside it.

For instance, if you are short on the funds needed to reach your goal. Develop a list of ways to raise the money. Can you borrow it from a lending institution, or a rich uncle? 

Create a list of solutions, beginning with the best possible resolution at the top and go from there.
Business plans can be time-consuming and thought provoking, but well worth the effort. They serve their purpose well as a road map to success. Being a Primary School Guest PE Instructor


Since around 60% of a Matt Fiddes Martial Arts School student base is made up of school-age children, it only makes sense to direct your marketing efforts to the school-age audience in your communitys school system.

You can do this by volunteering to serve as a guest physical education instructor. This is a great way to excite and motivate a large number of children in just one sitting.

Getting into the public schools system can be a tough nut to crack. However, some instructors have found success by first approaching private schools, and getting letters of recommendation before approaching the public schools.

Once you do manage to get invited to serve as a guest instructor, youll have a challenge facing you. You may have anywhere from 35 to 100 students, whose minds are full of martial arts myths, and their bodies full of energy  in other words, these are not your usual disciplined martial arts students.

Hollywood can be given a considerable amount of credit for giving martial arts its violent image. So, the first order of business will be to downplay the violence, and emphasize the strong life skills that martial arts can bring to ones life. 

Explain that through the discipline that is the martial arts, students gain respect from and for others; their self-esteem improves; and knowing that one can defend themselves if the need arises brings about an increased level of confidence.

Youre likely to be teaching students from Infant age through to the last year of primary school. So, naturally, your approach will be different. However, these classes will have one thing in common  and that is, that while youll be teaching your classes some simple stretching and technique movements, share little titbits of martial arts philosophy throughout your class. 

Dont spend a lot of time pounding the philosophy of the martial arts into their heads. To capture and hold their attention, youll need to spend most of your time on the physical aspects of the martial arts.

And, you wont be looking for perfection from your young students either. So, dont worry about refining their moves. Remember that this session is designed mostly to enlighten these young students to the value and fun of taking martial arts lessons with the Matt Fiddes Martial Arts Schools.

The important point to remember here is that although this is an underlying marketing effort on your part, you are not trying to push these kids to purchase lessons at your school. Youre merely trying to educate them, their instructors, and their parents of the benefits of the martial arts.

Many of them may feel inspired to rush into your Martial Arts School the next week to sign up for lessons. Others may toss it around in the back of their minds for a while, and venture into your Martial Arts School in a couple of months.

These presentations serve a multitude of purposes. You help to raise the awareness of the benefits of the martial arts to those who, otherwise, may never have had the opportunity to learn; you make a positive impression for your Martial Arts School to the community; and you make the students that you taught feel better about themselves and their abilities.

Make sure you give out a VIP guest pass to every student to take home. And take the name address and phone number of each child to send them a certificate and an invite letter. We will be closed due to staff training with Dave Kovar. Please let your students know about this now. They will then have plenty of notice.

Details will be put up on www.mattfiddes.com for students to see also We have now added 26 Newsletters to the Franchise website. All you have to do is add a forth page with details of your schools news. Then you will have an amazing four page newsletter for your students. All the articles have been written by professionals. 

These Newsletters are a great retention tool.  You decide which ones to use for any given month. Please take a look at the lastest drill videos on the homepage of the Franchise website business plan.jpg BUILD A PLAN TO SUCCEED 3 primary school.jpg Getting new members!! All Matt Fiddes martial arts schools are to close on the 8th and 9th July. 26 new Matt Fiddes Newsletters!!!!! Two new Movies added to the website dave kovar.jpg default.jpg default.jpg
10 2005-06-08 PT-PT-DT (Prime Time, Premium Time, Down Time) There is a time and place to do everything. When students are in the school it is Prime Time. All of our focus should be on servicing them (Retention is the single most important thing we can focus on). Premium Time is when we are giving a tour, the sign up Level two process.

11 2005-06-08 Build A Plan To Succeed

Behind virtually every successful business, is a well thought out business plan. Business plans serve as a road map to success. 

Of course, if youve ever taken a look at a business plan, you may feel that the time and effort required to create one may be too much for you to spare. 

After all, youve written down your goals and you feel driven to succeed in running a successful martial arts school. So what more is there?

 
A Business Plan Helps You On Your Journey
Business plans essentially work on the same principle. You want to take your business from point A to point B. So, you set your goals and plan exactly how youd like to achieve them. Youll consider your strengths and weaknesses, your marketing potential, and how to handle competition.

At any given time, you can review your plan to see how far youve come, and how far youve got to go before reaching your goals.

Time often diffuses the excitement of achieving a long-term goal. If you run into any difficulties along the way, youll be able to motivate yourself back onto the right track by looking at your business plan and realizing that with a little focused effort you can easily get back on track.

Running a martial arts school requires a large outlay of cash. And, in order for it to be successful, you must meet or exceed the expectations of your customers. You must be able to offer them something that your competitors cant  or dont.

You have a great deal of time and money invested, and your professional future actually depends upon the success of your school. So, taking the time to develop a business plan is really a valuable investment in the future of your martial arts career. Four Basic Emotions Your Students All Experience

1. Mad
2. Sad
3. Glad
4. Fear

Your goal, of course, is to keep them glad. Certainly, when a new student enters your school, there may be an element of fear. Also, as they advance in rank and begin to spar, multiple sparring, board breaking, teach and lead etc. fear again may be an issue. If a student fails an exam they may get sad. If they feel they were slighted in any way theyre going to get mad. You must work to make certain they stay glad. 

Structure your program in a manner that as much fear is stripped out of it as possible. Slowly introducing sparring over 6 12 months is a good method of eliminating fear. Taking responsibility for creating a curriculum that is reasonable in its demands. Cover exam material every class to cut down on your test failure rate. This will help prevent both sad and mad students. Where else could you adjust your program to keep you students glad instead mad, sad or in fear?

When people feel good about our program and service, they stay with us. The first step towards keeping your students glad is to make sure you seem glad also. Do you smile? Do you laugh? Do you take the time to be friendly? Even though youre the all-knowing martial arts master, do you seem like a down to earth person? Do you work to make your students feel as important as you make yourself out to be? 

When I use to come into the school, I would literally warm my facial muscles up so it would be easier to smile. This is especially helpful when youve been driving all day long and your face is kind of locked into a driving frown. It may seem strange to warm up your smile, but it really helps. Youre the host of a series of events (classes) that evening. Each of those events has to be exciting and leave the student on a high note. That only happens when the instructor is having a good time.

Always think of teaching as performing. If it were just a matter of saying the words that need to be said in front of a class, then teaching would be easy. No, its the excitement, the intensity, the pacing, the balance of humour and deadly seriousness that makes a martial arts class physically, emotionally, and spiritually powerful. As the leader of the school, that all has to come from you. You are climbing on stage each night.

BE A HAPPY PERSON AND INSTRUCTOR! Five reason why students become disenchanted or unhappy

1. Didnt Get What They Were Promised
When you make promises regarding what a student will learn and benefit from, exceed their expectations. Unfortunately, in our business, many of us make promises we dont intend to keep. 

For instance, you tell a student they are going to learn self-defence, but spend the first year on material that has nothing to do with self-defence. You say youre going to teach self-discipline, but start and finish classes late demonstrating you dont have any discipline yourself.

A key to success is always under-promise and over-deliver.

2. Someone Was Rude Or Arrogant
Just because someone is a white belt or an under-rank doesnt mean they are not as important as you. You simply have a skill they seek. They in turn may have expertise in other areas you dont. That doesnt make them any better than you either. 

 All men are created equal, is a saying that doesnt to everyone but martial artists. If, as we promise, the martial arts are based upon respect and courtesy, then we will be the shining examples of those virtues. Respect is a two-way road. 

Too often, black belts are like the big kid in the locker room who is arrogant and demanding because he knows he can beat up all the other kids. You have to check your attitude and monitor the tone of your voice. Ask someone you trust if you come off as short or arrogant when talking to students.

I have been accused of, not suffering fools easily. This is my area of weakness and I work on it all the time. I am also not a real outgoing person. If Im in a room and everyone knows me and I dont know anyone, Im accused of being aloof and arrogant for not making more of an effort to shake hands and saying hi to everyone. Im getting better at it. Even though I know that if no one in the room knew me and I didnt know them, no one would care or even notice. So, why should it be any different with me? Because if thats how people feel, then there is nothing I can do to change that. I have to change. 

3. No One Took The Extra Time To Help Them
When a student is having a tough time with a technique, dont assume they will go home and practice it, especially if it is a child. If you dont take the time to help them right after class, then the technique may not get better. This leads to frustration, which leads to drop out. If you cant do it, train your leadership team to seek the struggling student and then work with them for ten minutes after class.

Invest ten minutes in a student and youll receive years of attendance from that student.

4. No One Listened To Them.
You have to tune up your listening skills. The odd thing about this is that it is actually pretty difficult to catch yourself, not listening. In a given night at your school, you may have dozens or more conversations with different people. 

Unless you are consciously monitoring your active listening skills as described above, you will be doing what has been natural to you for a long time. Because, not listening well is natural, it doesnt really stand out to you unless you look for it.

5. A Staff Member Projected A Cant Do Attitude.
Train your staff that if one of them is asked a question, he takes ownership of the question and gets it answered. Instead of saying, I cant do that or I dont know. Teach them to say, Ill find out and get back to you within "x" hours. 

Also, if a student calls and asks for you or someone else on your staff, rather than the receptionist saying, Hes in class, may I take a message? teach them to say, Hes in class, is there anything I can help you with? 

Often the purpose of the call is something very simple that the receptionist can handle, like, What time is the seminar on Saturday? This gives the caller what they want quickly and portrays your school as a positive, can-do organization.


Failure to make yourself and your team fully aware and committed to preventing these five common, easy to fix mistakes, will translate into a struggling school. business plan.jpg BUILD A PLAN TO SUCCEED 1 karate pic.jpg Four Basic Emotions Your Students All Experience REASONS WHY STUDENTS LEAVE default.jpg default.jpg default.jpg
13 2005-06-14 There is a direct relationship between how well you do anything and your self-concept in that area. You perform as well as you believe yourself capable of performing. You are as effective as you believe yourself to be in whatever you do. You can never be better or different on the outside than you believe yourself to be on the inside.

Whenever you feel good about yourself and are doing well at your job, or in your relationships, or at martial arts, you are demonstrating a positive self-concept in that area. Whenever you do poorly or feel inferior or clumsy, or behave badly in some situation, your negative beliefs about yourself are being demonstrated in your behaviour. As within, so without.

What makes positive change possible for you is that your self-concept is largely subjective, not objective. Your beliefs about yourself, especially your self-limiting beliefs and doubts, are not based on fact at all. Negative ideas about yourself and your abilities are usually based on false information and impressions you have taken in and accepted as true.

As soon as you begin to reject these self-limiting ideas, they begin to lose their power over you. By deliberately changing your self-concept, your true potential becomes unlimited.

A young man, about twenty-five, who came to my seminar was working as a construction labourer. During our discussion of the influence of the self-concept, he had a mental shock. The lights went of for him. He was stunned. 

He told me that his father, an uneducated workingman, had told his children continually, Our family has always been labourers and we always will be. Its our lot in life. Thats just the way it is. As he grew up hearing this, he accepted it as a fact, a belief, and when he left school, he went to work as a labourer.
In the seminar, he suddenly realized that he had bought his fathers limited outlook in life without question. He had swallowed his fathers belief system whole. He looked at himself and the world the way his father had.

Now, seven years later, he was still working by the sweat of his brow. He had inadvertently allowed his father to shape his self-concept with regard to his work and his possibilities. He saw how his beliefs about himself had shaped his expectations and his attitude. He realized that he had continually attracted only labouring opportunities and that his outer world, his relationships and his lifestyle had all been determined by his beliefs.

He decided at that moment that he didnt like being a labourer. He had always felt he could do much more, but he had also felt trapped. Now, he experienced a new sense of freedom and control. He realized for the first time that his limitations were on the inside, not on the outside. 

After the seminar, he quit his labouring job and got into sales, starting at the bottom. He did poorly at first, but he was determined. He read every book he could find on selling. He listened to every audiocassette program. He attended every sales seminar available in his area and he even travelled to seminars in other cities.

We kept in touch. Within one year, he had doubled his income. In two years, he was making four times as much. He went to the top of his sales force and was soon hired away for more money and greater opportunity.

Within five years he was making more than £100,000 per year, had a beautiful home, a lovely wife, two children and an exciting future lying before him. He was the master of his own destiny.

The turning point for him, as it was for me and thousands of others, was learning how his self-concept controlled his life and then deciding to change it. Everything followed from that.

Not only do you have an overall self-concept, which is a general summary of beliefs about yourself, but you also have a series of mini-self-concepts. These parts of your self-concept control your performance and your behaviour in each individual area of your life that you consider important.

You have a self-concept for how much you weigh, for how much you eat, for how much you exercise or for how fit you are. 
You have a self-concept for how you dress and how you appear to other people. You have a self-concept of yourself as a parent, and as a child to your parents. You have a self-concept for how popular you are, at work and among your friends.

You have a self-concept for how well you play each sport and even for how well you play each part of each sport. A golfer may have one self-concept as a great driver and another self-concept as a poor putter, and thats the way he or she will play.

If you are in sales, you have an overall self-concept for how good you are as a salesperson, which determines how well you do in sales. You also have individual self-concepts for how good you are at prospecting, identifying needs, presenting solutions, answering objections and closing. In each of these areas, you will be relaxed and competent, or tense and unsure, depending upon how you think of yourself performing those tasks.

You have a self-concept for how well organized and efficient you are, in both your personal and your work life. And you will always behave in a manner consistent with your self-concept. You cannot behave in a way that is different from your subconscious programming any more than a computer could decide to disregard its programming.

You have an overall self-concept for how competent you are in your field and for how much money you are capable of earning. You can never rise much higher than your self-concept level of ability or earn much more or less than your self-concept level of income.

In fact, if you earn more than 10% above or below what you feel you are worth, you will feel very uncomfortable. You will immediately begin engaging in compensatory behaviour. If you earn 10% too much, you will begin to spend the money, lend it, and invest it in things you know nothing about or even give it away or lose it. Such throw-away behaviour is practiced by anyone who suddenly finds him or herself with more money than is consistent with his or her self-concept.

There are many stories of men and women who have won large sums of money in various lotteries. In most cases, if they were working at labouring jobs when they won the money, in two or three years they were back working at the same jobs, their money was gone, and they had no idea where it went.
If you earn 10% or more below your self-concept level of income, you begin to engage in scrambling behaviour. You begin to think more creatively, work longer and harder, look at second income opportunities or think about changing jobs in order to get your income back up into your self-concept range.
Where money, weight or anything else is concerned, you gradually get into your various comfort zones, and once there, you do everything possible to stay there. You resist change of any kind, even positive change.

The comfort zone is the great enemy of human potential. Your comfort zones become habits of living that are hard to break. And any habit persisted in over time eventually becomes a rut. Then, instead of using your intelligence to get out of your rut, you use most of your energies making your rut more comfortable. You justify and rationalize your situation as being unchangeable. You feel and say, Theres nothing I can do.

But there is a lot you can do to change your future. In the next few articles, you will learn how to break out of your comfort zones. You will learn how to step up to the keyboard of your own mental computer and input a new belief system for yourself. You will learn how to re-design your self-concept so you can get more of whatever you really want in life. Maintain The Mystery

As you might expect, martial arts tends to be a bit mysterious in the eyes of the layman. What they know is what they see in martial arts movies. Martial artists in the movies possess an air of distinction, integrity, and confidence  not to mention the enviable ability to defend themselves against incredible odds.

Therefore, while they may not expect you to walk on water, students will expect to be duly impressed by your quiet confidence, professional demeanour, and remarkable skill. Throughout your class, and when in the public eye, it is important to remember to behave accordingly.

Although it may be tempting to discuss your personal life with your students, keep in mind that the fact you even have normal everyday problems is not what your students want to know. Thus, the mystery is gone. 
If you think thats difficult to pull off on a daily basis, youre right. That is why youll want to surround yourself with strong, positive influences from family and friends. Theres no room in the world of a martial arts professional for negative thought and actions.

Dave Kovar History

 Kyoshi Kovar is the head instructor of Kovars Family Martial Arts Centers Inc. He has been teaching karate since he was 15 years old and currently holds Black Belts in 9 different styles of Martial Arts. In 1982 he was rated "California Competitor of the Year," and in 1988 he won the United States Martial Arts Championships Men's Heavyweight Division in Reno, Nevada. He has operated his own Martial Arts School in the Sacramento area since 1978, making Kovars Family Martial Arts Centers one of the oldest and most respected Martial Arts schools in Sacramento. With over 2,400students, Kovars is ranked as one of the top schools in the nation.

Over the years Dave has developed a unique method of teaching that has earned him the distinction of being the Instructor of the Year in 1992 from the United States Martial Arts Centers (an association of over 1,300 schools in the United States and Canada). Dave's teaching techniques give the instructor the unique ability to help students improve their existing skills while increasing their confidence, discipline and respect. In fact, so many other Martial Arts instructors have inquired about these techniques that the Kovar brothers have developed a series of "How to Teach Martial Arts..." videos. These videos have had phenomenal sales both nationally and internationally.
 
Meyoshihan Tim Kovar holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Applied Economics from the University of San Francisco. He has had years of experience in the business and corporate world. Tim joined his brother in 1987 as the business manager of Kovars Family Martial Arts Centers, Inc. Tim is a Sandan (3rd Degree Black Belt) in Kenpo and a Shodan (1st Degree Black Belt) in Tae Kwon Do. He is also a past member of the Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. Tim is currently a Rotarian and was voted Carmichael business person of the year in 1998.

In 1992, Tim & Dave Kovar were nominated for the Small Business Administration Businesspersons of the Year and made it into the top 5 for the western United States. In 1994, they received the "Multi School Operator of the Year" award by the United States Martial Arts Centers (an association of over 1,300 schools in the United States and Canada). In 1997, they were voted the #3 school in the nation (out of 18,000 schools) by Martial Arts Professional Magazine. In the same year they were also inducted into the Martial Arts Hall of Fame.  They also serve on the Board of Directors for the International Martial Arts Association. 

The Kovar brothers now operate eleven successful schools and have purchased their own commercial property. They are committed to community service and are very civic minded. Over the years they have made hundreds of school presentations during Red Ribbon Week doing talks on "Just Say NO to Drugs" and "the ABC's of Conflict Avoidance". They conduct two major fund raising events per year, with the proceeds going to help local charities (most recent charities are the Kiwanis Family House of Sacramento and the North Area Teen Center, a non profit organization that helps at-risk teens, and the Child Abuse Prevention Council dave kovar.jpg National Shutdown on  July 8th and 9th for all Schools default.jpg Kovar History default.jpg default.jpg default.jpg

But there is a lot you can do to change your future. In the next few articles, you will learn how to break out of your comfort zones. You will learn how to step up to the keyboard of your own mental computer and input a new belief system for yourself. You will learn how to re-design your self-concept so you can get more of whatever you really want in life. Enrolling and keeping students twice as long, is easiest if you know the answer to one simple question: Who is the most important person in the world? 

The President? The Pope? Elvis or someone else? 

The answer is clear to at least ninety nine percent of the world. The most important person in the world is the person you are talking to. The prospect, student or parent you are addressing on the other side of your desk is the most important person in the world, at least to them. 

It is amazing that so few instructors ever realize this simple fact of life. With rare exception, people are not interested in what you did for someone else. They are only interested in what you can do for them. Each person you meet in your studio wants to be treated like the most important person in the world. 

If you let him down in this regard, you will lose a sale, a prospect or a student. 

Make it your goal to make every student, parent and prospect feel great every time you see them. Build them up, complement them at every opportunity and make them feel great about themselves.

If you hear a student has a new car, or you notice it yourself, ask if you can see it after class is over. They will be delighted that you noticed and that you are interested in them. When you see it, comment on something you like about its appearance. 
This will make your student feel great. Knowing that his instructor likes his car is like a vote of personal approval for him. It builds self-confidence and makes him feel like a million pounds. 
It works with parents as well. 

When little Jasons mother walks in with him, tell her how nice her dress looks or that her new hair style really suits her. Tell her what a dedicated mother she is for bringing Jason and his friend to class. Comments like these payoff tenfold with whomever hears them. I am not suggesting that you tell people things you do not mean or that you should be insincere. On the contrary, if you are not sincere, it will surely backfire on you. Instead, what I do suggest is that you pay as much attention to the things that go on around your studio as you do to the things that happen in it. 
Paying attention to your students and the things that matter to them will insure you keep them longer. 17th June Leeds & Swindon

16 2005-06-21 The first impression that you make on a new customer is a lasting one  and a very important one. With today's emphasis on, "professional schools" there has been a corresponding increase in the push to hard-sell potential students into long, expensive programs. We are all for schools being more professional, but that doesn't mean we have to become hard-sale centres. 
The student/teacher relationship is built upon trust. This trust factor is key for the long-term retention of the student. The process of moving someone from stranger to friend and then friend to a student will depend on how the student perceives you and will establish the foundation of the relationship.

When a potential student walks into your studio and talks to you about signing up for a martial arts class, how do you react? Is it a matter of just having him quickly sign a contract, taking his money, and telling him to show up at the scheduled time?

Do you give your customer the impression that you are too busy to spend a few minutes with him? Do you rush him? Do you try to sell him something that he doesnt really want? Does he walk out of your studio wondering if hes made the right decision in signing up for your martial arts program?

Or, do you talk to that person at length about why they want to join your school, and what they hope to gain from the martial arts? Do you try to learn as much about a potential new student as possible? Like, what they enjoy doing in their spare time? Where they go to school? Or, where they work, and what they do there?

Making a customer feel that they are important to you is one of the first steps to a successful enrolment process. And a successful enrolment process is a very significant step to running a successful martial arts school.

Most of the people walking through the doors of your studio have a pretty good idea of what they are hoping to gain from martial arts training. 
Your job will be to determine what their ultimate goal is, and help them to understand how attending your program will help them to achieve that goal.

Youll show them the steps they will need to take, and provide them with an idea of how long it will take to see their goal through to fruition.
Providing concrete direction will result in a long-term student who is committed to their training.

Discovering Your Students Goals
Keeping students satisfied begins with knowing what they want to achieve from their martial arts training. Martial arts training is no longer limited to just achieving a black belt. People are interested in the martial arts for a variety of reasons. 

For example 
1. Weight loss -- With the attention being paid to the ever-increasing problem of obesity, many people are seeking a fast, effective way to fight the battle of the bulge.

2. Self-defence -- Perhaps the person who just walked into your studio was mugged recently, or maybe theyre nervous about living in a big city and just want to learn how to defend themselves.

3. Self-esteem/Confidence  Martial arts is a pretty impressive skill to possess and one that not everyone can do easily. This builds confidence and proves to be a real boost to ones self-esteem.

Discovering what a student wants to achieve from their martial arts training will help you to sketch out a road map to their success. Though the process of discovery can be a little tricky.

Youll want to begin by conducting an extensive interview with your potential student. Start by getting your customer to relax with a little small talk. As they become more comfortable with you, theyll open up. Soon, youll begin to realize what they are really looking to achieve in their martial arts training.

This person may not come right out and tell you that they are signing up for your martial arts program for the purpose of increasing their self-esteem and building their confidence. So, you will need to learn to read between the lines  and study their body language.

Youll learn a lot from watching their eyes. If they have difficulty making or maintaining eye contact, your potential student is probably seeking to build their confidence.

People desiring to lose weight may be pretty easy to spot. Though you may find that some folks who look slim and fit, may want to use martial arts simply as a way to keep weight off and improve their fitness level.

Encourage customers to enrol based on their needs and goals only. If they sign up for reasons other than their own, they will eventually lose interest in the program. Therefore try to avoid selling your program based on what you think are the benefits of martial arts training.
Take notes throughout your interview to help you in creating your new students roadmap to success.

Charting A Map To Your Students Success
Once youve discovered your students goals, you can begin creating an action plan. Students will be more satisfied and more likely to be successful if they can see where they begin, where they are going, and the steps theyll need to take to reach their goals. 

Let them know that you will create a personalized plan that is designed around meeting their goals. Give a copy to the student to refer back to as they progress through their training. 

The Closing
Once your student has revealed their personal reasons for pursuing martial arts, and youve both agreed on the strategy for achieving their goal, you may think its time to have him sign the membership agreement. 

Actually, this is the perfect opportunity to tie your customers goals to their membership by recapping, thoroughly and completely, how martial arts training can benefit them and how the membership with your school will help them to achieve those goals.
In the end, youll want your student to leave with a sense of accomplishment, satisfied that they have taken the first significant step towards reaching their goal. 
 
Its about building trust and that comes from listening and gaining a full understanding of what he or she is seeking from the arts and then honestly representing if you can help him or her achieve those goals. Why Complaints Are Good For Retention

Its important to realize that only a percentage of our students will actually take the time to complain. Rather than complain, they simply drop out. They vote with their feet and their dollars. 

Our job is to get complaints. Get feedback by creating a system that encourages students to provide us with feedback. We must also create an atmosphere that encourages students to speak to us. Many schools are run with such an oppressive atmosphere that students are actually nervous about speaking with the instructor. 

People have enough stress in their life. Rather than go through the additional stress of approaching a self-obsessed instructor, they simply stop coming to class.

Stay On The Same Side As The Student
Its important that you and the student are on the same side of the problem rather than on opposite sides fighting against each other. You want your student to feel as though you are on their side and together youre working against the problem. 

You are not the enemy, the problem is.

Dos And Dont When Dealing With Complaints.
Dos
1. Do show that you respect, care and are concerned about the student.
2. Do listen to the student. In many cases thats all thats needed. The student wants to know that you respect them enough to listen to their concerns.

Donts
1. Dont get defensive. Getting defensive never helps your cause. Typically, it hurts it. When you get defensive, it seems like youre hiding something or youre not really listening. 
2. Dont forget that the real issue is the students time, energy and money that is at stake, NOT YOURS.
3. Dont act as if youre the most important person in the world. YOURE NOT. THEY ARE. karate pic.jpg BUILDING TRUST

11 2005-03-16 His best friends are celebrities, his business is expanding and his fortunes appear to grow with each passing year. 

Most of us would never hope for such things in our wildest dreams, but for Barnstaple martial artist Matt Fiddes it has become a reality while he is still only 23. 

Matt counts Michael Jackson and Uri Geller as his best friends and rubs shoulders with other celebrities, including magician David Blaine. 

He says his company, Matt Fiddes Black Belt Academies, has just been valued at £4 million and this month marks his fifth anniversary in business. Matt currently has 42 schools nationwide, stretching from Cornwall to the Midlands, including a number in North Devon. 

Students learn the importance of self-discipline and respect and also promote a strong anti-bullying message. 

With the establishment of an international franchise, Matt predicts that by the end of this year there will be 100 academies in the British Isles and even across the Channel into France. 

"When I first came along, people thought I would be a five-minute wonder, but here I am five years down the line," said Matt, who shares his success with wife Marcia and her children Charlie and Archie. 

"Every time I hear something negative or jealous it just makes me work even harder." 

Matt says his friendship with both Michael Jackson and Uri Geller has also helped to push his career onwards. 

Now he has plans for "how to" books on martial arts and a TV programme. news02.jpg 'Karate Kid Flying High'

6 2005-03-16 Pop start Belinda Carlisle and psychic Uri Geller were among the guests at a martial arts extravaganza held at the Queens Theatre, Barnstaple. The duo had earlier thrilled kids at the Children's Hospice South West, at Fremington, when they visited the hospice before travelling on to the Queen's by stretch limousine. The event, organised by the Matt Fiddes Black Belt Academy, drew huge crowds who waited outside the theatre to catch a glimpse of the American singer who had solo hits with "Heaven is a Place on Earth" and "Circle in the Sand" after she split from the all-girl group the Go-gos. 

Although she did not perform at the extravaganza - an annual event held to honour students of the academy - the singer said she was delighted to have been asked to attend. She said : "I've been through the area many times in the past 23 years of touring, since I was about 17. I've been to the UK many times, but I've never actually been to Barnstaple. "I think that the kids at the hospice were very excited too. They were really funny and appreciative towards us. It was an honour and a good experience." Mr. Geller, who recently released a fitness video with Matt Fiddes said : "I met Belinda about two years ago. We became friends and it's just fantastic for her to come to Barnstaple. I don't know how many world-famous celebrities come to Barnstaple. It's great for her to be here. "To see hundreds of people outside waiting to see us arrie was very moving. I've performed in front of thousands of people and Belinda played a concert or 250,000 people in Brazil, but you never get used to it. It's very flattering and moving, especially in this part of the world." Mr Fiddes said : "Belinda and Uri are here for a good cause. We went to visit the Children's Hospice and they put smiles on the faces of the children. I'm very glad Belinda came here and it's obviously very good for Barnstaple." news03.jpg 'Hospice Children Thrilled to Meet Belinda and Uri'

19 2006-05-09 WHEN Matt Fiddes was in school in Swindon he was bullied by classmates, was told he would never make it in business and he left with no qualifications to his name.

Now he is a millionaire with 250 martial arts schools and counts Michael Jackson and paranormalist Uri Geller as his mentors and best friends.

His remarkable rise from rags to riches is all down to believing in himself and realising goals, says Matt, whose schools now show children the road to success.

Matt, who is only 26, has mixed with some of the worlds most controversial and richest people, including Mohamed Al Fayed and says he and his best friends are his inspiration. 

But it wasnt always that easy for Matt when he was a child and that is what has driven him to excel in business. He was brought up in Swindon where he attended Holy Rood, Lainesmead, St Josephs and Greendown schools.

I was bullied by groups of kids because I was shy and quiet and was an easy target. I was told in my career class that I would never make it in business. I just hated school and knew I would do well once I was away from that environment. 

It is true that so many successful people left school without good qualifications  people like Richard Branson. 

I would love those kids who bullied me to see me now  they made me even more determined to do well.

From the age of eight I was in to martial arts, found I was good at it and I had a dream of opening my own school with the emphasis on teaching children how to succeed in all lifes challenges. When I was 17, I opened the first Matt Fiddes Martial Arts School in Devon with just £100 in my pocket.

Now he has classes across the UK attended by 9,000 members of all ages and in Swindon they are held in Station Road and at Freshbrook Community Centre, teaching tae kwon do and kick boxing.  There are 250 clubs including some in Germany, Switzerland and Holland.

It was when his success was featured in a national newspaper about how the bullied boy had become a millionaire that Uri Geller got in touch with Matt. We had the same agent and Uri was impressed with what I was teaching in my schools and we became best buddies. He is godfather to my daughter Madison who is two. 

Uri introduced me to Michael Jackson and the three of us hung out together when Michael was in England. We would get a curry and watch films and Michael asked me to be his bodyguard when he was in Europe. He and Uri are such an inspiration to me  they are my mentors.

Matt had no doubts that Michael Jackson was innocent of the child abuse charges he was cleared of earlier this year. I had no doubts at all. As I am a role model to children in my clubs, I obviously could never have supported him if I thought there was any truth in the allegations. 

To hear him talk about how people latch on to him for his money and then try and extract money from him is appalling.

Michael is a really nice guy, really soft and kind, is really clever and I am certain he will have a major comeback. He is one of the hugest stars in the music industry. It is not true that he has major health problems and no money.

Matt now lives in Devon with his wife Marcia and daughter Madison. His parents John and Nigella have moved south west too. When I started out my dad didnt want me to go into the business because he thought it would be teaching violence. Now he is my greatest supporter and works with me, as does my brother Nick, 23, who is a manager.

We werent well off when we were growing up. I have three younger brothers and Dad was a railway worker who was made redundant.

I love Swindon and am planning to buy a house in the town as I am there so often. My grandparents still live in the town too. There are quite a few of us Swindonians who have done well now. I think it is a great place.

He plans now to continue opening more schools across Europe. Our aim is to lead by example and show kids how to succeed through life. It is all down to attitude, confidence and perseverance.

20 2006-05-09 MATT Fiddes met his Swindon students when he visited his martial arts school in Station Road to give out their belts with their new grades and took a master class for them. 
The school in the Centre Fitness gym in the Station Industrial Estate teaches kick boxing and Tae KwonDo to students aged three to 50. 

Swindon-born Matt, pictured, who has opened 250 schools in just six years, said: "It was great to be back in Swindon. The gym is the one where I first trained when I was a boy so it was emotional to come back here. I never dreamed I would have a school here when I came here all those years ago. 

"The students here, of all ages, have done very well. They have all passed their grades. 

"The Swindon staff are brilliant too." 

The belts students were awarded range from white, through purple, yellow, orange and green. 

From next year the school in Swindon will be the only one of 250 Matt Fiddes schools to be able to assess students for black belts. 

Matt Fiddes' Martial Arts School franchise owner Pat O'Driscoll is offering free trial sessions to anyone who calls the school in January. 

He will explain what the school does and give an invitation to attend the free sessions. 

This applies to children and adults.

111 2005-10-05 Dear sirs

I could not find a message board on your website but I felt that praise is overdue.
2 of my sons aged 15 & 11 started at your Honiton school in the spring. 

I thought it would be a 5 minite wonder and they would get bored after a few sessions. - how wrong could I get!!  The boys look forward to each week and as for the teaching it is incrediable to see two children( who had had a traumatised young childhood with an abusive father) change from being withdrawn, shy and frightened little boys to young men who will never again be bullied by anyone. 


My boys now know that they can achieve anything they want in this world and without aggression or bad manners. 

Their whole out look on life has changed and that has had several knockon effects including school work and making strong friendships with the right people.

As a single parent I was worried about the expense but i do not regret a single penny. I would be grateful if you would pass this message on to every one including possible new students parents. 

Please say a huge thank you to Ian Hooper and Mr Watchman for their patience and inspiration.
yours faithfully

1 2005-03-16 Teachers often pair small children together and tell them to hold hands during activities, such as crossing the street or walking through a car park. This is known as the buddy system and it helps teachers and youth leaders to manage groups of children easily and keep them safe.

The buddy system also promotes better health because your support, guidance and companionship help your buddies to achieve their goals, whether their goal is better health, Safety or improving martial arts skills.

The buddy system is perfect for your martial arts training. Choose a partner, or buddy, to practice your techniques and to help your fellow students be safer and healthier. Training with a buddy will encourage both of you to exercise more frequently and/or regularly and enjoy your exercise sessions and companionship. You will learn from each other and support each other during every challenge and difficulty. Youll also be able to extend this support to all aspects of your martial arts training and your quest for better health. For example, your support of each other can reduce the stress of quitting smoking and/or learning to follow a healthful eating plan to lose weight.

You may choose almost anyone to be your buddy: your spouse, a family member, a close friend, or maybe even a friend who will become a closer friend by being a buddy! Better yet, your entire family can be buddies to each other. Train as a family so youre able to assist each other during your martial arts classes as well as your family life, including the additional health support that everyone needs to achieve ultimate success. default.jpg Better Health - By Jennifer G. Galea MS RD default.jpg TRUE
2 2005-03-16 You can act like a Black Belt; even though you are still working hard to earn that honor. Black Belts possess a very important characteristic: pride. Black Belts act and speak with pride. They walk into the dojo with their heads held high. They do so not because they think they are better than others, but because they are proud of who they are and what they have accomplished, knowing that they have worked hard to achieve their goals. That is why others respect Black Belts so much. You too are able to walk with your head held high, proud of yourself and your accomplishments in martial arts and the rest of your life. Youre also able to reveal your pride in your actions and words before you earn your Black Belt. 

You must simply work hard and make good decisions and good choices. The pride you have about who you are and what you believe gives you strength and confidence. Being proud means that you feel good about yourself. People with pride work hard at their jobs, study hard at school and even train hard at the dojo. Success comes to those who work to be their best; failure is often the result of poor, sloppy work habits. You will not be proud of yourself if you make bad decisions. 

Some people steal because they think they need more possessions to be accepted by others. Some people lie because they think they need an unfair advantage to accomplish their goals and be liked. If you are proud of who you are, what you have, and how you be- behave, then you never need to lie, cheat or steal. The best part about pride is that once have, youve achieved it, you have already experienced many of the good things in life. 

Black Belts know how to avoid unnecessary conflict not because they are scared, but because they have enough pride to shun trouble. That is the power of pride, and pride is a quality that no one is able to take from you. People with pride receive better opportunities in life because they work harder. If you are proud of whom you are, then you will work hard at being even better. That is why those with pride gain so much respect from others. People with pride are also happier because they are satisfied. Youre able to earn respect and become happier by taking pride in whom you are and what you dojust like those who have earned their Black Belts. adshots3.jpg Black Belt Pride by Joseph Galea default.jpg TRUE

1 Over the past few years, the property market has been moving very fast and has led to significant increases in property prices. This has made it very difficult for many people to afford to buy a home. This is a problem particularly faced by first time buyers, as although they may be able to raise a mortgage, this will often fall far short of the cost of a property. 

<b>Getting on the ladder</b>

It is, however, still possible for first time buyers to get onto the property ladder and there are actually some advantages to being a first time buyer:

interest rates are at their lowest for more than 30 years first time buyers are more appealing to sellers because they are not in a chain (that is they are not part of a long list of people all dependent on each sale in a chain going through on time) 

first time buyers are much sought after by mortgage lenders First time buyers default.jpg FALSE 2006-06-27 17:45:23
2 Buying a home is probably the biggest financial decision you will ever make so it is worth taking time to consider whether it is the right choice for you. You will become responsible for all the costs of maintaining the property, including major structural repairs, routine repairs and improvements.

You also need to take the following costs into consideration:

mortgage repayments 
mortgage protection insurance for if you fall ill or lose your job 
life assurance to enable your family to pay off the mortgage if you die 
contents insurance against the risk of theft, fire, flood or other accidents 
council tax and water charges 
gas, electricity, telephone, etc 
ground rent and service charges may apply 
The process of buying a house or flat is also costly, as you may need to pay for:

a solicitor or licensed conveyancer 
an independent survey 
the mortgage to be arranged 
the Land Registry fee 
Stamp Duty 
a home information pack 
As a tenant, you may be able to claim housing benefit to help with the rent. As an owner-occupier, you will not receive any housing benefit to help with your mortgage costs. You may be entitled to income support to assist with housing costs, but this is not usually payable for nine months after you first claim it.

If you are elderly and own your home, its value may be taken into account in assessing whether you are eligible for financial help with the costs of residential care. Costs involved when buying a new home default.jpg FALSE 2006-06-27 18:06:47

Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) give information on how to make your home more energy efficient and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. All homes bought, sold or rented require an EPC. </p>

<p>Energy Performance Certificates contain:
</p>
<ul><li>information on your home's energy use and carbon dioxide emissions</li>
<li>a recommendation report with suggestions to reduce energy use and carbon dioxide emissions
</li></ul><p> 
Energy use and carbon dioxide emissions
EPCs carry ratings that compare the current energy efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions with potential figures that your home could achieve. Potential figures are calculated by estimating what the energy efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions would be if energy saving measures were put in place.
</p>
<p>The rating measures the energy and carbon emission efficiency of your home using a grade from 'A' to 'G'. An 'A' rating is the most efficient, while 'G' is the least efficient. The average efficiency grade to date is 'D'. All homes are measured using the same calculations, so you can compare the energy efficiency of different properties.
</p><p>
Around 27 per cent of the UK's carbon dioxide emissions come from domestic homes. Carbon dioxide contributes to climate change.
</p>

<h5>Which buildings need an EPC?</h5>
<p>An EPC is required when a building is constructed, rented or sold. A building will need an EPC if it has a roof and walls and uses energy to 'condition an indoor climate'. This means it has heating, air conditioning or mechanical ventilation. For example, a garden shed would not need an EPC if it doesn't have any heating.

alt="" /> I would like to introduce myself. My name is Marian Vinall and I am the newly appointed Safeguarding Lead for Devon Tennis. Until last month I was Welfare Officer at Atlantic Racquet Centre in North Devon where I am an active member. My background was in Education, being a Primary School Teacher with specific responsibility for safeguarding and now have taken over the Governor role for this. I actively promote the safety and well-being of all children, young people and adults. I want to support the clubs in Devon to be the best we possibly can by adhering to the relevant LTA policies regarding minimum standards thus ensuring safety and best practice for everyone.</span></p>

4 WWF-UK FALSE WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature. We do this by:
<br><ul><li>conserving the world's biological diversity</li>
<li>ensuring that the use of renewable resources is sustainable</li><li>promoting the reduction of pollution and wasteful consumption.</li></ul><br>

WWF is the world's largest independent global conservation organisation.

However, this is only part of what we do.
<br><Br>
We also work to address global threats such as climate change, the consumption of natural resources and the use of toxic chemicals. We influence attitudes and behaviour through lobbying, campaigning and education, and work with people at all levels - both in the UK and around the world - to seek long-term sustainable solutions for the benefit of people and nature.
<br><Br>
How your contribution can help us:
<br><br><ul><li>£10 could pay a Rhino Protection Unit Ranger's salary for 4 days.</li><li>£15 could enable the orang-utan project in Malaysia to buy a Global Positioning System, so that the exact location of orang-utan nests can be recorded.</li><li>£20 could pay the wages of an educational assistant teaching Colombian rainforest children about the environment.</li><li>£30 could buy a camera to help monitor the movements of tigers in Nepal.</li><li>
£72 could help protect the greater one-horned rhino by covering the costs of supplying park rangers with an elephant to carry out anti-poaching patrols in Nepal.</li><li>£100 could buy a medical kit for staff in Dudwha National park in India.</li><li>£240 (or £20 a month) could pay one Ranger's salary for a year for the International Gorilla Conservation Programme in Rwanda.</li></ul><br><br> 1081247 wwf_logo.jpg 5 http://www.wwf.org.uk/ WWF urgently needs funds to help protect endangered species and their habitats around the world.<br><Br>

All we ask is that the research is of the highest scientific quality, is relevant to cancer, and does not duplicate work done elsewhere. AICR is currently funding over 200 research projects in 20 countries. aicr_logo.jpg 2 http://www.aicr.org.uk/ FALSE
99 National Childbirth Trust FALSE The UKs leading charity for pregnancy, birth and parenting.

<br> nationalchildbirth_logo.jpg 4 http://www.nct.org.uk/ FALSE
100 National Blind Children's Society FALSE Blind children can get left behind when their friends go to discos. They can't play ball games or experiment with make-up. In the classroom they struggle to keep up, especially now that more go to mainstream schools. The National Blind Children's Society is here to make sure they don't get left behind. They give them the education equipment they desperately need, such as talking computers. They pay for a wide range of recreational activities so they get the most out of life.<br> nbcs_logo.jpg 4 http://www.nbcs.org.uk/ FALSE
101 National Deaf Children's Society FALSE The National Deaf Children's Society is the only UK charity solely dedicated to supporting all deaf children, deaf young people, their families, carers and professionals working on their behalf in education, health and social services. Every day an average of two babies are born with a significant permanent hearing loss. Hundreds of thousands more will experience mild or moderate deafness or lose their hearing as a result of childhood illness or accident. In addition, 1 million youngsters under 8 years old will suffer temporary hearing loss caused by Glue Ear. Happily for all these children and their families the NDCS has existed for more than half a century, as a source of sympathetic, expert advice, information and advocacy support on every aspect of their deaf child's development from diagnosis to career choices. 
<br> ndcs_logo.jpg 4 http://www.ndcs.org.uk/ FALSE
102 NSPCC FALSE The NSPCC is the UKs leading charity specialising in child protection and the prevention of cruelty to children. We have been directly involved in protecting children and campaigning on their behalf since 1884. Our work includes 180 services throughout the UK. We also run 2 free helplines: our 24-hour child protection helpline that provides information, advice and counselling to anyone concerned about a childs safety and ChildLine, the UK's confidential 24-hour helpline for children and young people.
<br> nspcc_logo.jpg 4 http://www.nspcc.org.uk/ Every day, thousands of children experience abuse and suffer in silence. But with your help, we can put a stop to this. By making a donation today, you can help us be there for more abused children.

<br><br>Donating through your salary is a tax efficient way of supporting the NSPCC. TRUE nspcc_quoteimage.jpg
103 Railway Children FALSE The Railway Children's vision is to offer an alternative route for vulnerable children away from the streets, into a life that offers safety and opportunity, helping to secure the future for them and their communities. 
<br><Br>
We work for the runaway and abandoned children who live in or around the world's railway stations. Working in the UK, India, Bangladesh, Mexico, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Russia and Siberia we provide: 
<ul><li>
A point of contact for children just coming onto the streets. 
</li><li>
Shelter, healthcare, education, training, protection and, above all, friendship.

<br> railwaychildren_logo.jpg 4 http://www.railwaychildren.org.uk/ FALSE
104 Teens and toddlers FALSE An innovative approach: at risk teenagers mentoring vulnerable small children with the consequence of a renewed sense of hope, love and self respect! Children Our Ultimate Investment UK provides practical, hands on response to tackle the issues that put teenagers on the path of social exclusion and pregnancy and builds their self esteem and aspirations for the future.
<br><Br>
Teens and Toddlers enables disadvantaged teenagers, both boys and girls, to mentor vulnerable small children in a safe nursery environment, giving them a new and positive experience of themselves, that they can make a difference and can be a worthwhile part of their community. Endorsed by the DCSF, the DoH and the PM Strategy Unit, the results of this well evaluated, evidence based intervention are substantial.
<br> teensandtoddlers_logo.jpg 4 http://teensandtoddlers.org/ FALSE
105 Elizabeth Foundation FALSE .....where deaf children learn to listen & speak for themselves
<br><Br>

support throughout the UK.
<br> elizabethfoundation_logo.jpg 4 http://www.elizabeth-foundation.org/ FALSE
106 Unicef FALSE UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, is dedicated to improving the lives of children.<br><Br>
We work with local communities and governments in more than 160 countries to help every child reach their full potential through long term and emergency work on healthcare, education and protection for children at risk.
UNICEF receives no statutory United Nations funding and thus relies entirely upon voluntary contributions to carry out its work.
<br> unicef_logo.jpg 4 http://www.unicef.org.uk The support provided by regular payments such as payroll gifts are absolutely vital to our programmes for children.<br><Br>
It is only with sustained, stable funding that these programmes are able to deliver the ongoing help required to make a lasting difference to childrens lives  and your regular donation will ensure exactly this type of secure support. TRUE unicef_quoteimage.jpg
107 Variety Club FALSE The Variety Club Children's Charity was founded in 1949 and aims to help sick, disabled and disadvantaged children throughout the U.K. Whether the charity is raising money to build a paediatric unit, donating a Sunshine Coach to a special school or taking a group of children on a fun packed "Variety at Work" day out, it aims to make a real difference, hopefully putting smiles on faces along the way.
<br> varietyclub_logo.jpg 4 http://www.varietyclub.org.uk/ FALSE

2 Setting up a Payroll Giving Scheme FALSE Payroll Giving enables employees to make valuable charitable donations straight from their salary and provides a continued and vital stream of income to charities and local community groups. An agreed amount is deducted from an employee's gross salary and sent to an approved payroll giving agency who pay it directly to the nominated charity.
<br><Br>
All modern payroll systems can handle payroll giving. The monthly donation is taken for pre-tax pay. i.e after calculation of National Insurance contributions but before PAYE is deducted. The payroll department will process the payroll deductions and send all donations to your Payroll Giving Agency. If you offer matching of the employees donations, you will need to transfer these funds to your Agency.
<br><Br>
The Agency will deduct a small administration fee (usually 25p or 4% of the donation) from each donation to cover its costs. Many employers arrange to pay this fee on behalf of employees so that 100% of employees' donations goes to the charity.
<br><Br>
Employees will see the pre-tax deduction from their payslips. If an employee is a basic rate taxpayer, a monthly donation of £10 will show up on the employees payslip as a pre-tax deduction of £10, but this is equivalent in cost to the employee of £8.00 after tax. Donations are deducted until the employees inform you to stop or change their donations. The Agency will report back to you so that you can keep track of total employee donations and any matching you provide. There are no tax forms for you to complete for either the employee or the company and record keeping is straightforward.
<br><Br>
Records that a company needs to keep are:
<br><Br>
1. A copy of the contract with the payroll giving agency.<br><Br>
2. A copy of your employee's donor form authorising deductions from their pay.<br><Br>
3. A record of deductions made from each employees pay receipts from payroll giving agency.

3 Frequently asked questions FALSE 1 <b>Q: What is Payroll Giving?</b><br>
Payroll Giving is a simple, tax-effective way for your employees to give to charity from their pay. Over 9,000 businesses already offer the benefits of Payroll Giving to around 5 million employees. And the numbers are growing all the time. This guide answers your questions about Payroll Giving and tells you how to get your own scheme up and running.
<br><br>
<b>Q: Why should I offer Payroll Giving to my employees?</b><br>
Running a Payroll Giving scheme can be good for your business. It shows that you are committed to working in partnership with the community, something that is increasingly important to customers and staff. It shows that you care about your staff - offering them the benefits of Payroll Giving can help to build better employee relations and attract the right people to come and work for you. It is easy and inexpensive to run, and you get a deduction against your profits for your costs. 
<br><br>
<b>Q: How does Payroll Giving work?</b><br>
Simple. Your employee asks you to deduct regular charitable donations from their pay. You make the deduction from before-tax pay  in other words, after calculation of National Insurance Contributions but before deduction of Pay As You Earn tax. This way your employee gets tax relief straight away at their top rate of tax. For example, giving £10 a month costs a basic rate taxpayer only £8.00 because they save £2.00 tax. For a higher rate taxpayer the cost is only £6 because they save £4 tax. You as an employer pay over all the money you deduct to an Inland Revenue-approved Payroll Giving agency, and they do the rest  distributing the money to the charities nominated by your employees.
<br><br>
<b>Q: Isnt it complicated?</b><br>
No. Most of the administration is carried out by Payroll Giving in Action and your chosen agency. All modern payroll systems can handle Payroll Giving. There are no tax forms to complete. And the records you need to keep are straightforward.
<br><br>
<b>Q: What records will I need to keep?</b><br>
You will need to keep a copy of your contract with the Payroll Giving agency, the forms completed by your employees authorizing you to make deductions from their pay, a record of the deductions made from each employees pay, and receipts from the Payroll Giving agency.
<br><br>
<b>Q: Who pays for the administration?</b><br>
Most of the administration cost is incurred by the Payroll Giving agency. They normally make a small charge which they deduct from donations before distributing them to charity. The charge is normally no more than 4 per cent of the donation, or 25p per payroll deduction, whichever is the greater. Your administration costs should be very small and are likely to be absorbed in your existing payroll costs. In any event, any costs of running a scheme will be allowed as a deduction against your profits.
<br><br>
<b>Q: Can I pay the agencys charge?</b><br>
Yes. Many employers like to do this so that the full amount of their employees donation go to charity. If you pay the agencys charge this will be allowed as a deduction against your profits.
<Br><br>
<b>Q: Can anyone who works in my company join the scheme?</b><br>
Any employee or pensioner from whose pay or pension you deduct Pay As You Earn tax may join the scheme. There are no limits as to how little or how much an employee can give. Most employees give £5 per month.
<br><Br>
<b>Q: Can I match the donations made by my employees?</b><br>
Yes. This is an excellent way of demonstrating your commitment to the community and building good relations with your employees. Any matched donations you make will be allowed as a deduction against your profits.
<br><br>
<b>Q: Can I use Payroll Giving to support my companys chosen charity of the year?</b><br>
Yes, although your employees will be free to give to any charity they choose. 
<br><br>
<b>Q: Do I need to know the names of all the charities to which my employees wish to donate?</b><br>       No. Besides, your employees may wish to keep their choice of charity confidential. Payroll Giving in Action can provide charity nomination forms which your employees can complete and return directly to us. Some agencies provide a charity card or charity cheque book so that your employees can give directly to the charities of their choice whenever they want.
<br><br>
<b>Q: Will my employees get unwanted mail from charities asking for money?</b><br>
Most charities like to write to their donors to thank them and give them information about how their donations are being used. The information provided by your employees is protected under the Data Protection Act and can be used only for the purpose for which it was given.
<br><br>
<b>Q: I want to run a Payroll Giving scheme. How do I get started?</b><br>
The first thing to do is contact Payroll Giving in Action on 01271 326131
<br><br>
<b>Q: How can I get the most out of my Payroll Giving scheme?</b><br>

1 Payroll Giving - working for a good cause FALSE "Simple, tax-free charitable giving direct from your pay." <br><Br>

Payroll Giving donations are deducted before tax so each £1.00 you give will only cost you 80p, and if you're a higher rate tax payer it will only cost you 60p. <Br><Br>

Payroll Giving - What a good idea !<Br><Br>

Payroll giving (workplace giving) is a valuable, long term source of revenue, providing regular income to help charities budget and plan ahead more effectively. Employees can choose to support any charity of their choice with a regular donation direct from their pay. <Br><Br>

Its cheaper because its tax free - for example, a donation of £5 per month costs the basic rate tax payer £4.00 (the taxman pays the rest!) <Br> 0.000000 0.000000
2 Charities FALSE Benefits for an individual charity:
<ul><li>Regular, reliable unrestricted income stream, which allows a charity to plan ahead and budget for the future</li><li>
Low administration costs as the PGAs transfer the donations to the charitys bank account and supply donor information at a nominal cost. Some employers cover this cost.</li><li>
Charity receives total donation including tax without having to reclaim tax at a later date.</li><li>

3 Employee Information FALSE <b>Can I give to any charity through Payroll Giving?</b><br><br>
Yes. - You can donate to any UK registered charity. If you want to give to a small local charity that is not well known it is advisable to include the registered charity number and address on your donor form.<br><br>
<b>Is there a minimum or maximum amount I have to give?</b><br>
No, there is no upper or lower limit, however, we recommend that you give to charity at least £5 gross per month which will cost you £4.00 if you are a standard rate tax payer or £3 if you are a higher rate tax payer.
<br><Br>
<b>How is Payroll Giving different to a Direct Debit (Gift Aid)?</b><br><br>
Payroll Giving is taken straight from your gross (pre tax) pay so there is no need for the charity you choose to physically claim the tax back through Gift Aid from HM Revenue & Customs, this saves them money in administration.<br><Br>
If you are a higher rate taxpayer, Payroll Giving is the ONLY way that a charity can automatically receive all your tax on your charitable donation.
<br><Br>
<b>How do I know that my donation will reach the charity I have chosen?</b><br><br>
The deduction will be shown on your payslip. <br><Br>Your employer has signed a contract with a Payroll Giving Agency, who handle all monies donated through the scheme and are regulated by HM Revenue & Customs.<br><Br>
A copy of the form you fill in is sent to your companys Payroll Giving Agency so that when your employer sends them your first donation they know who the donation is coming from and which charity to send it on to.<br><br>
Additionally each charity is sent a copy of the form and in most cases they will write to you to Thank you for your donation and then update you regularly with further information about the charity and their work.<br><Br>
<b>If I decide to take part in Payroll Giving and fill out a form today, how long will it be before the first deduction is taken from my pay?</b><br><br>
This depends on when you fill in the form but as a rule it will start on the next available payroll run so if you fill in the form on the 24th of a month it will not start until the following month.<br><br>
<b>Can I stop giving when I want?</b><br><br>
Yes you simply notify your payroll department.<br><Br>
<b>What happens to my Payroll Giving deduction if I leave my job?</b><Br><br>
If you leave employment Payroll Giving will automatically stop, it is up to you to contact your payroll department at your next employer to start giving through the scheme again.<br><Br>
<b>Is there an administration fee?</b><br><br>
Yes. Although the Payroll Giving Agencies are themselves charities they do need to make a small charge to cover their operating costs. Some employers will pay this fee themselves so the charities receive the full amount of the donation.<br><Br>
Where the administration fee is not paid by the employer, the Payroll Giving Agency will deduct it from your donation before passing it on to the charity. The administration charge will vary depending on which Payroll Giving Agency your employer uses. It will be either 25p per month or 3% or 4%.<br><Br>
<b>I pay tax at the higher rate of 40%, how does this affect tax relief on payroll donations?</b><br><br>
You will receive tax relief at the highest rate of tax you pay; therefore each pound you give will only cost you 60p.<br> 0.000000 0.000000
4 Employer Information FALSE <b>Payroll Giving is growing rapidly </b><br><br>
Payroll Giving has increased from £37 million in 1999/2000, to over £109 million in 2007/2008
<br><Br>
<b>There is room for further growth </b><br><br>
     Only 2% of UK employees participate in Payroll Giving schemes. In the US, the employee participation rate is nearly 35%. <br><br>

<b>Payroll Giving can make a tremendous difference to UK charities </b>
<Br>  <br>   If we could increase participation to 10% of UK employees, then charities would receive an additional £300 million. 
<br><br>
<b>And it's good for business </b><br>
   <br>  Research shows that companies which offer Payroll Giving believe it improves the company image, enhances community involvement programmes, and supports employee volunteering. 
<br><br>
<b>96% of companies feel that Payroll Giving is something a good employer should offer.... </b><br><br>
     And nearly all said they would like to increase participation levels in their organisations. 0.000000 0.000000
5 Case Studies FALSE 0.000000 0.000000
6 News FALSE 51.084528 -4.070597
7 About us FALSE <div id="staffpic"><img src="images/staff.jpg" alt="Payroll Giving" width="228" height="222"  /></div>Although Payroll Giving has been around for several years now, many charities have found it difficult to use the scheme as a fund raising mechanism. The obvious benefit of receiving tax-free donations directly from wages is offset by the considerable cost of recruiting people to the scheme through the distribution of literature and by giving presentations nationwide.<br><Br>
In the past, charities have individually attempted to generate payroll support, often with disappointing results. The idea behind PGA is to represent as many charities simultaneously as possible by pooling the resources required to gain the benefits outlined above.
<br><Br>
By representing a large number of wide-ranging charities, employees feel they have been given the freedom to make their own choice. Promotions are much more cost-effective when several charities are represented simultaneously, and in this way charities can increase their payroll giving support at an affordable cost.
<br><Br>
PGA does not guarantee to raise funds for specific charities, the degree of response is entirely dependant upon employee choice, but it ensures all promotions are completely impartial. 0.000000 0.000000
8 Donate FALSE On clicking the Donate Now button you will be taken to our Giving Online website that is hosted on a secure server. This page is protected with a Geotrust SSL with up to 256-bit encryption. Your confidential information cannot be viewed, intercepted or altered.<br><br>
On completing the donation form, an e-mail of the form will be sent direct to your e-mail address. At the top of the form is a link for you to click to confirm that you made this donation. The donor form is also stamped with the date and time and the individual IP address of your computer.<br><br>
Our server then receives your confirmation of the donor form and we pass the donor form direct to your Payroll Department to make the deduction.<br><br>
You should allow up to 6 weeks before the donation will show up on your pay slip. The time delay simply depends on when your payroll department receives the form relative to the cut - off date for each payroll run.<br><br>

This vision continues to influence every project we undertake, today we are recognised as one of the most prominent names in design, print  and sign manufacture in North Devon, with a reputation for innovation and a genuine talent for anticipating the practical and aspirational requirements of our clients.

Our installations across Devon are co-ordinated centrally by our experienced team of designers, manufacturing and fitting teams.


True to our Devon roots, we have an instinctive 'feel' for the details that underpin a successful sign package, with thoughtful planning from the initial consultation assuring you  a friendly professional approach to design and visualisation process.  Take a look at any Sign Shop sign and you'll notice something else; an all-round specification which exceeds your expectations. Quite simply, at The Sign Shop we refuse to compromise on the standards, which define our name.


We're equally proud of the diversity of signs we are able to offer, from a full colour digitally printed banner that really stand out from the crowd to complete corporate branding providing a total sign, design and print package.  We never forget that signs the most important single element to advertising your business.  Asssuring you that peace of mind is what The Sign Shop is all about. 0.000000 0.000000

9 Services FALSE Three dimensional stainless steel lettering is one of the fastest growing sign products we offer. Stainless steel lettering and logos add impact and an air of quality to any signage project.
<br><BR>
All 3D stainless steel lettering is produced in-house- offering you more flexibility and a better price. If you have looked at 3D stainless steel letters before and been put off by high prices or lack of choice it's time to think again, time to get a new supplier. 
<br><br>
A great product starts with quality materials. We use high quality exterior grade stainless steel in a range of thicknesses (gauges). 
<br><br>
When specifying 3D stainless steel lettering it's important to think in terms of metal rather than plastics. 0.000000 0.000000

375 DSCF1989.JPG TARKA JUNIORS MEET ANDY MURRAY Tarka Tennis Players meet Andy Murray

36 Children from the Tarka Tennis Centre visited the National Tennis Centre, Roehampton last weekend.  The state of the art tennis facility was officially opened by the Queen in March and is the training centre for elite players.

Children gained experience on many surfaces including grass and clay as well as receiving coaching sessions from a National Coach.

For many one of the highlights was meeting Andy Murray, The British No.1 Male Player, who was using the centre at the same time.  He took time to talk to players, sign autographs and have photos with the children.  

The Trip to The National Tennis Centre was inspiring for all concerned.  Many of the children who were on the trip are in County Squads and now are hoping to follow in Murrays footsteps.

If we haven&#39;t run Pceft since the booking was made/or updated, then we haven&#39;t even tried yet e.g Pceft run Fri 5.30 pm, reference booked on Fri night 6.00 pm and customer calling on Monday 2pm. If they are calling Tues after Pceft had been run on Monday and it still current, the payment hasn&#39;t gone through, there is a problem. Check all the details (As per &quot;Declined bookings procedure&quot;). Go through &quot;once processed tickets will be despatch....to.....in approx days/weeks/months as appropriate&quot; after updating the reference. <strong>(</strong>You can make changes/additions to this category of booking)</p><p><strong>Processing/Current</strong> <strong>-</strong> This does not necessarily mean it has been authorised. It is in the payment procedure - <u>you cannot</u> retrieve a booking in this state. - you can confirm all the details and note any discrepancies with the name and address to be amended after the next overnight run. It would be safer to say &quot;that the booking has been submitted for payment and we shall find out if it has been approved after our next overnight run, perhaps you would like to call again to check everything has been approved tomorrow/next working day&quot; (what you say depends on the original enquiry &amp; time of last Pceft run) </p><p><strong>FYI </strong>- When pceft is being run all CC &amp; IB bookings are submitted for payment and become &lsquo;Processing&#39; This procedure can take 10 minutes or as long as it takes! All bookings that have been approved will become &lsquo;Authorised/Current&#39; until the next overnight run, when they will archive.

Customers take an option on the telephone system according to the match on sale. We are a support call centre and handle Home match sales only. Sometimes calls are split between TZ and their own call centre. </strong></p><p><strong>DISABLED<br /></strong><br />Disabled spaces are available, along with up two helpers if needed.<br />Disabled seating is situated in the Kop Grandstand, Paddock and Anfield Road. The visually impaired are also situated in the Paddock Area.</p><p><strong>Liverpool</strong><strong> FC have the following:<br /><strong>SEASON TICKET HOLDERS</strong></strong> who have purchased a specific seat for every Premiership Home match. (For your info only - there is a waiting list of 56,000 and STH can pass their Season Ticket to another family member when they die. STH have smart cards which gain them entry to all Premiership games. From 08/09 season STH booking <strong>their own seat</strong> on <strong>Cup matches</strong> will enter the stadium with their Smart Card - no paper ticket will be issued. The history will show the match but will not show PRT (as no ticket will be printed). If they&nbsp;move seats they will have a paper ticket.<strong> WHEN DOING MULTIPLE SALES YOU MUST ASSIGN THE CORRECT NUMBER TO THE CORRECT ST SEAT.</strong><br /><br /><strong>E-SEASON TICKET HOLDERS</strong> have paid for the right to book/watch video clips online. It DOES NOT give them a fan card. In the 04 season, all E-STH&#39;s were able to use their E-STH number as if they had a fan card. However, in the closed season of 2005, all E-STH&#39;s were emailed and told that they had to actually purchase a fan card. (Tim 10/11/05) <br /><strong>FAN </strong><strong>CARD</strong><strong> HOLDERS</strong> have a priority booking period for matches. One Fan Card per person, and one ticket per fan card. Each match has to be recorded against their individual number in order to gain loyalty. For example for European Champions League they may be prevented from buying a ticket for the next round if they have not recorded the ticket against their number. This card has a multi-seasonal life span. See further info on FAN CARD LOYALTY.&nbsp;<strong>LFC are no longer selling Fan Cards (discontinued at end of 2007/8 season) but&nbsp;current FC holders still have all the benefits as listed previously.&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>LOSC</strong> (Official Liverpool Supporters Club). Various benefits including 10% discount in Official Club Stores.<br /><strong>OLSC</strong> (As Supporters Club above, plus Fan Card) This membership is being phased out and will no longer exist at the end of the 08/09 season.<br /><strong>EUROPEAN TRAVEL CLUB</strong><strong>:</strong> This no longer exists. However, anyone who booked the ETC during the 2004/2005 season has the same rights a Fancard holder (ie fancard for life).<br /><strong>PRIORITY RIGHTS</strong><strong>(ex shareholders)</strong> NOT the same as PTS - these have special sales periods on Cup matches.<br /><strong>MEMBERSHIP SCHEME (09/10) :</strong> From beginning of 09/10 season the old PTS Membership has been amalgamated with the new membership. Members will need loyalty in order to purchase <strong>category A</strong> games (see Member tab). These games will be sold in conjunction with loyalty from the 2008-09 season. Members who meet the loyalty criteria for each game will be given a priority selling period before the sale is opened to other members. Approx 50 per cent of the 5,000 available member tickets will form part of this initial sale. For both Everton and Manchester United, 100 per cent of the 5,000 tickets will be made available for sale on the basis of previous loyalty and there will be no secondary sale. Existing members/fch/supporters will qualify provided they have the qualifying criteria and have purchased the Membeship. The remaining 50 per cent of tickets will be available to all members on a first come first serve basis during the secondary sale period. <strong>Category B</strong> matches will be available to all members on a first come first served basis while stocks last.</p><p>Everyone who buys a Membership&nbsp;will have on their purchase history a FANCRD purchase. Also new codes are <strong>OLA10 (adult), OLJU10 (junior) and OLTO10 (toddler).</strong>&nbsp; Therefore every Member should have Fan Card &quot;rights&quot;.&nbsp;(you do not charge a booking fee). You cannot change the address or put for collection because they automatically get sent to the address on the database. For General Sale and European games they receive a ticket just the same as everyone else. PTS members are automatically part of the New 2008/9 Membership Scheme. Purchased <strong>CANNOT</strong> be made&nbsp;at the Ticket Office windows for PTS Sales. Telephone, internet or post only.<br /><strong>New Membership Scheme</strong> <strong>(2008/9)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits are as listed on the web, but include exclusive booking period, SMS alerts which provides up to date info on ticket availability and access to the Buy Back/Exchange Scheme (STH may be able to get a refund against games they cannot attend), various discounts and opportunity to join ST Waiting List. Members do&nbsp;<strong>NOT </strong>have smart card entry to matches. Customers have to renew this every year. It is not like the old fan card.</p><p><strong>AUTO</strong><strong> CUP SCHEME</strong><strong>:</strong> STH can register in writing for the Auto Cup Scheme which means they will get their seat for various cup games. This will show as SOLD with money against it. Once the first cup match has been played they cannot join the scheme for that cup (i.e. if the Carling Cup run has started they cannot register for the Carling Cup Auto Cup Scheme. If the credit card they have nominated to pay for the tickets with declines payment, the customer will receive a letter from the Club asking them to call the credit card line and book. Once they have done this they MUST verify their details to the club in writing,(letter or fax). They need to provide name, full address, customer number, daytime phone number expiry date, start date, issue number. This is to correct the problem for any future purchase. <strong>If the customer history shows PPSPND</strong> this means a payment has been tried on the Autocup Scheme and failed. The Club will retry and the customer will be written to if there is a further problem. We should not take payment unless we have been told to. STH do not pay the 50p booking fee (as of 13/10/08).<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>NORMAL ADMINISTRATION FEE</strong><br />50p per ticket for home games (STH do not pay this on Cup Matches. PTS members do NOT pay this on Premiership matches). Booking fees may vary online.</p><p><strong>NUMBER OF TICKETS</strong><br />4 adult tickets per customer/call.&nbsp; On general sale &amp; certain cup games you can sell 2 adults &amp; 3 children, or 3 adults and 2 children (Jill email 18/1)&nbsp;- A SUPERVISOR MUST BE CALLED TO OVERRIDE. Larger family groups should be advised to book by postal application. OK to sell two different PTS sales on the same transaction (max 4). Do not sell PTS and General Sale on the same transaction. Maximum of 6 tickets can be purchased at the Ticket Office Window.</p><p><strong>CARDS ACCEPTED &amp; TICKET DELIVERY &amp; DESPATCH</strong><br />Mastercard, Visa, Switch and Solo. When making a booking if none of the fan cards are the same as the cardholder then the delivery address should be changed and typed with the name of the cardholder. Every call should be started by asking for the credit card holders fan card to by typed first as the lead booker. You CAN change the address label if the customer requests it. If the cardholder is not attending and tickets are being collected see notes under COLLECTIONS.</p><p><strong>FAMILY TICKETS &amp; CONCESSIONS</strong>;<br />Unaccompanied children, if the parent wants to send them without a responsible adult, then they can. One or more of the children must pay full adult price, follow the combination rules.<br />MATCH BOOKINGS can be made BY TELEPHONE, over the counter, online or by postal application. For League matches, the family area cannot be extended out of Anfield Road, for Cup and UEFA matches, once the standard family&nbsp;area is sold out we may be instructed to sell elsewhere (but only if told). <br /><br /><strong>COMBINATION/CONCESSION AREAS</strong> are blocks where you can sell adult and child together. From the start of the 2007/08 season these are Upper Anfield Road area, starting with 221-224 then moving into the other AU blocks once these are sold out (this may change for Cup Games). Tickets can be sold as one adult and one child or 2 adults and 2 children or in ratios of 2:1. or 1:2. For example 2A+1J or 1A+2J. It is OK to&nbsp; mix and match the combinations. You can make an exception and sell 1 senior, 2 adults and 1 Junior in a family group (tim 1/8/07) On league games the sale is 4 maximum on Cup games we may be able to override to 5 or 6 for families in the correct combinations(ONLY EVER BY A SUPERVISOR). If you have one adult and three children, all can go in the combination area but one of the children will have to pay adult price(this is a definite rule unless told otherwise. The discounted price for children only applies in these combinations. You can&#39;t do 3 or 4 adults and 1 child. Children can go in other areas but must pay full price.&nbsp; Senior discounts available throughout the stadium (NO DISCOUNT FOR PTS SALES). Child concessions are always 50% of the adult price and Over 65&#39;s are 75% of the adult price.<br />LEAGUE GAMES: Once combination areas are sold out. There are NO CONCESSIONS FOR CHILDREN</p><p><strong>CONCESSION PRICES</strong><br />A Junior ticket is 16yrs or under on match day. They can go to games unaccompanied, but must pay full price as they cannot go in the COMBINATION AREAS. <br />A Senior is 65yrs or over. Seniors get a concession throughout the stadium, they can also sit in the COMBINATION blocks within the appropriate combination (ie Senior instead of adult).<br /><strong>BABES IN ARMS</strong>: all customers have to have a ticket. It is a health &amp; safety issue. The club must be able to provide an accurate number of EVERY HEAD through the turnstiles. Babies&#39; seat must be situated next to the parent.<br /><br /><strong>FAN </strong><strong>CARD</strong><strong> LOYALTY</strong><br />Until General Sale is announced Fan Card Holders are entitled to ONE ticket per fan card.<br />To gain loyalty for future games all transactions must be recorded individually against each individual fan card.<br />YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO LOOK UP FAN CARD NUMBERS. The customer must know their number or get it and call you back! <br />When completing a transaction you must have all the relevant Fan Card numbers to hand. Fan cards (when available) are one per person only. Each fan card number quoted must be cross referenced with the individual customer&#39;s name/address for each individual ticket purchased.<br />To buy tickets for the whole family during a priority period each person will need a fan card, otherwise they will need to wait until general sale.<br />We are unable to disclose Fan Card numbers over the phone.</p><p><br /><strong>LOST FAN CARDS &amp; CARDS NOT RECEIVED</strong><br />In writing only to the Club, do NOT advise the customer to call Customer Services. Customers must pay a &pound;10 admin charge - details on the website. <br />Data Protection / Security - It is Club policy not to disclose an individuals information to anyone other than that individual.&nbsp; If we were to do this it may compromise both the supporter and the Club itself.<br />Time - We simply do not have the time to search hundreds of thousands of records for a particular Fan Card number or individual.&nbsp; If we were to do this it would greatly increase the call length and therefore affect adversely the number of calls we can answer.<br />If a customer has made a fairly recent purchase, LFCCRD product will show in the history. Once printed the FANCRD product will show. If there is a delay between the purchase and the print (a week or so) then we can override.</p><p><br /><strong>YOU MUST NOT LEAVE SINGLE SEATS.</strong> For example do not sell a pair from a set of 3. Do not mention these seats offer other areas. </p><p>TEXT: If there is a stop code in the text. Take customer phone number and contact LFC. If it says POA (proof of address req&#39;d) on a PTS sale they must not buy a ticket until they have proved the address (Jill 14/9/07).</p><p><strong>GENERAL </strong><strong>SALE</strong><br />If the customer says that they are a Liverpool fan, they can book tickets on a general sale, even if they live in the home town of the away team.<br />Available tix have 03 reservation codes, or &#39;Y&#39; available. Every customer has to be added to the database. Take date of birth, phone numbers, always ask Data Protection question. You must also now take e-mail addresses if they have one/want to give it (2/11 KG) Do not give out customer numbers. Maximum 4 adult tickets per call (see notes on family groups/combination areas). Customer who wish to purchase more should make a postal application. If a customer wants to purchase Juniors and Seniors these can be added, take a date of birth. You must add all fancard numbers or they will not be eligible for certain tickets for future matches. Family sections are not extended. </p><p><strong>CHANGE OF ADDRESS DETAILS</strong><br />Advise to the Club in writing ONLY, to enable the database to be changed. TZ DO NOT change addresses. However, we CAN overtype the final address label as long as the customer can confirm address details for all fancard numbers involved in the transaction AND as long as there is nothing in the TEXT screen to indicate that tickets must only go to the registered address. Don&#39;t forget that PTS members are different when being sold a ticket on a PTS day of sale. See specific notes.</p><p><strong>COLLECTIONS</strong><br />We can set tickets for collection if necessary; leave the name, then on a line underneath type &quot;TO COLLECT&quot;, leave the postcode. Cardholder must take payment card and must be able to confirm the name and address(on the address label - keri 9/8). <br />The card holder should be the lead booker (address label can be changed if necessary). If the cardholder is not collecting the tickets, the person collecting must bring a signed letter of authorisation from the cardholder and that letter must include the collector&#39;s name. This person collecting must bring I.D. which includes their name and address. A passport can now be used as identification. People turning up without this will not be able to collect the tickets. Tickets will not be available to collect until the following day (at least). </p><p><strong>DUPLICATE TICKETS</strong> <br />Lost tickets can be replaced, but duplicates will only be provided on match day. Take payment card to the Ticket Office.</p><p><strong>RESTRICTED VIEW TICKETS</strong><br />In the main stand, the worst blocks are MW and MX, &quot;MA is not so bad&quot;.&nbsp; View of the goal is obstructed, or the corner flag, depends on which block you are booking! Usual restrictions are stanchions or gable end walls. In the KOP, the restriction is in blocks 108, 208 and in the family area; the seats are against the side wall so you can not see any throw in on that side&#39;s side line. There are also restricted view seats in the back row of the Paddock (the same post restrictions as the main stand only worse because you are sat right behind them) On European games the first row of the Paddock is classed a restricted due to the advertising hoardings. Only restriction is that they can&#39;t see the side line right in front of the hoarding.</p><p><strong>RESTRICTED VIEW SEATS NOT MARKED ON THE SALES SYSTEM .</strong>MS/MA/22 SHOULD COME UP AT &pound;1 CHEAPER (JH 8/8/6)<br />Restricted views that are &pound;1 cheaper are stanchions (Part of pitch may be restricted)<br />Restricted views that are &pound;3 cheaper are severely restricted (last 2 rows of AL - If customers stand up in front of them, they in turn have to stand up, they cannot then see the Kop goal due to the overhang of the Anfield Road Upper Tier)</p><p><strong>AWAY MATCHES</strong> <br />Available via Postal Applications, telephone bookings, or at the box office window. The sale is prioritized and subject to how many away games a supporter has attended.</p><p><strong>AWAY FAN AREAS</strong><br />Allocated in the Lower Anfield Road Stand and can only be bought via the away club.</p><p><strong>CORPORATE BOOKINGS</strong><br />If a game is released to all STH we can sell them a ticket. Any queries we will take their details and phone numbers and contact LFC. Will continue to sell to Shareholders as long as we can see that they have the share on the text relating to their Customer Number. Corporate customers have a book and for Cup games they use a voucher from the book. They are not entitled to any extras, unless told otherwise.</p><p><br /><strong>PRIORITY RIGHTS HOLDERS (EX -SHAREHOLDERS)<br /></strong>Shareholders who are also STH can usually book one ticket on the share and one on the Season Ticket. Ask if you get an enquiry. If they are just a shareholder and do not have a season ticket, it will generally say &#39;shareholder&#39; in the text. We book shareholders on TZ01 &amp; TZU01 if you can see that they are a shareholder in the text. There is no loyalty required for any match and can look them up by postcode on the system. Any queries we will e-mail the Club. Shareholders with 1-29 shares are generally entitled to one ticket. 30-59 shares= 2 tickets. 60-89= 3 tickets.90 and more = 4 tickets.</p><p><strong>CAR PARKING</strong><br />Waiting List for Car Parking as the car parking is sold on a seasonal basis and is allocated to permit holders.</p><p><strong>MEMBERSHIPS</strong><br />Memberships can be bought at anytime throughout the season.

Please tell callers this when giving the direct line to them.</p><p><strong>MATCH DAY SALES</strong><br />Cash turnstiles open for adult tix sales for both home and away fans. Always subject to availability. For away fans you need to check each individual match.<br />Concession tickets have to be purchased from the ticket office, as do tix purchased by card.<br />Turnstiles open at 1.30pm until KO. One turnstile will remain open after kick off. We never know which one.<br />(Usually one open til half time but you will have to find out which one from the stewards when you arrive)</p><p><strong>MATCHDAY SALES</strong><br />Please note that you CAN sell the areas shaded grey (marked matchday sales only) to supporters if they are available on the system.&nbsp; These areas are located in the South stand and the NWU<br />These areas are marked like this to ensure that no one sells a supporter a ST in this area</p><p><strong>MERCHANDISE</strong><br />We no longer take merchandise orders, customers should redial the&nbsp;0871 911 1973 and take option 3 (this line does not open until 10am)</p><p><strong>RESERVES GAMES<br /></strong>All reserve games are held at Hetton-le-Hole and are pay on the day or STH&#39;s&nbsp;use appropriate vchr from their ST book.&nbsp;(unless otherwise stated)</p><p><strong>YOUTH GAMES</strong><br />These are played at The Acadamy, Cleadon, which is located on the Sunderland Rd (A108).&nbsp; It is 10mins from the Stadium of Light.</p><p><strong>24/7 CLUB</strong><br />This is the junior supporter&#39;s club, they receive vchrs to get a free chlid with one full paying adult ie&nbsp;an adult &amp; child pair.&nbsp; This will only be on nominated games (check current info).&nbsp; Put the child as &#39;Z&#39; code and then pass info to Sally/Anne to email to Club. (Name, cust. no. that its booked under, 24-7 member no.)&nbsp; They can sit anywhere in ground.</p><p><strong>NEW CONCESSION INFO (updated 26/06/08)</strong><br />According to new child protection act laws, anyone over the age of 12 may go into the stadium without being accompanied by an adult i.e. a 12yr old and a 14yr old may go into the stadium to watch a home game on their own.<br />If under the age of 12, then the child <strong>MUST</strong> be accompanied by an adult of 18yrs or older.</p><p><strong>DATA PROTECTION ACT</strong><br />If the customer says that they do not want to be contacted with club related information, then update the database mail flag fields.</p><p><strong>NEW WEB SALES SYSTEM</strong><br />Sunderland are moving to a new Internet booking system.&nbsp; It will be using our S4S database and customers user name will be their customer no. and their password is their postcode (with no gap).<br />You are likely to get calls asking for their cust. no. to get tickets.&nbsp; If they ring &amp; ask for their cust no, please do the following:<br />Option 1. Sell them the ticket they want and then the cust no will be on the ticket and they can make a note of it.<br />Option 2. Get them to quote details email, tel no, DOB etc. and then tell them their cust no.<br />Option 3. Pick up product 02WAI (which is zero price, no bkg fee), this will send them a blank tix with cust no on it. (this should be last resort)!!<br />Their password is on the second screen of the customer maintenance screen.&nbsp; Please ask me if your not sure on anything!!</p><p><strong>TRAINS AND CARS<br /></strong>Most trains go through to the Metro link, which takes you to minutes away from the stadium. If you get out at the central station, it&#39;s about a 10 minute walk anyway.<br />City centre car parks are about 5 minutes walk away. </p><p><strong>MERCHANDISE &amp; SHOP</strong><br />As a rule merchandise is sent out within 28 days</p><p><strong>VISUALLY IMPAIRED</strong><br />As long as there is something on the text about the person being visually impaired, they are entitled to take a helper for free (Z code). The visually impaired person pays the full price. (A, J or S)</p><p><strong>SEASON TICKET HOLDERS WILL HAVE SMARTCARDS FOR THE 09/10 SEASON NOT VOUCHER BOOKS<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>CAR PARKING 09/10</strong><br />There&nbsp;WILL BE&nbsp;match day car parking for this currrent season. We are also still selling Season Ticket Parking in the Green Car Park.&nbsp; The code is GRN GRN &amp;&nbsp;you MUST&nbsp;always remember to write the match code on the 1st line of the address label (after the name) otherwise the club won&#39;t know which match the booking is for.</p><p><strong>NUMBER OF TICKETS</strong><br />Unless told otherwise, one ticket per Season Ticket holder until General sale. However, we rarely sell matches before they reach General Sale unless it&#39;s a cup match. For League matches Season Ticket holders submit postal applications for additional tickets before the match goes to General Sale. For cup matches Season Ticket holders usually have their seats held for them for a certain period. <br />During a General Sale there is normally a limit of eight tickets per transaction. Check with a supervisor to see whether it&#39;s possible to exceed this limit.</p><p><strong>SEAT LAYOUT</strong><br />There are some seats which are next to each other on screen, but the seat numbers are not consecutive. As long as the seats are adjacent to one another on screen, they are adjacent to one another in reality. Obviously, you can&#39;t tell if you are selling from the list method, this info only applies if you are selling graphically!</p><p><strong>TICKET DESPATCH</strong><br />First class post within two working days. For a Saturday or Sunday match all tickets are posted up until 5pm on Thursday. After this point we can continue to sell tickets right up until the start of the match AS LONG AS IT&#39;S A HOME MATCH (people can literally be in the queue at the Sunderland ticket office and can still call us). Obviously these tickets will be for collection at Sunderland-don&#39;t forget to make this clear. There are normally turnstile sales for a Sunderland home match as long as the game is not sold out. (Turnstile sales are adult cash only, concessions tickets can only be booked at the counter, cards can only be used at the counter.)<br />Away Fans; if tickets are available, then turnstile tix are cash and adult only, concessions and other forms of payment would have to be made at the counter.<br />If it&#39;s an AWAY MATCH taking place on a Saturday or Sunday telephone sales would normally cease altogether at 3pm, though there may be exceptions to this about which we are notified on a match-by-match basis. It is rarely possible to collect tickets from an opposing team&#39;s stadium. </p><p><strong>CHEQUE PAYMENTS<br /></strong>Supporters who wish to pay by cheque can do so by sending the cheque for the full payment (no booking fees) to the address below along with the area in which they would like the seats and a stamped self addressed envelope.<br />The club will then try to allocate the supporter as near to their preferred seats as possible.<br />Cheques payable to Sunderland AFC.<br />Send to: PO Box 165, Sunderland, SR5 1WF</p><p><strong>COLLECTIONS</strong><br />We can set tickets for collection if necessary. Leave the name and the first line of the address on the final address screen. Overtype the rest with &quot;COLLECTION FROM TICKET OFFICE&quot; in a style which will be easily seen by the staff at Sunderland (so they don&#39;t put it in the post). There should be a good reason for the tickets to be set for collection as the club want to keep any match-day queue to a manageable level. Make sure you ask the customer to take the card that was used to make the purchase to the ticket office when collecting their tickets.<br />Note that collections are from the Black Cats Reception (well sign-posted building the other side of the ticket office).<br />Customers may collect their tickets on match day or beforehand. It a customer wants to collect his/her tickets beforehand at the very least four hours should be allowed to elapse between booking and collecting (ideally a whole day should be allowed before collection)!<br />When tickets are automatically for collection (because the club are no longer posting out) there is no need to amend the address label as described above.</p><p><strong>FOREIGN CUSTOMERS<br /></strong>We can add foreign customers -when you get to the part where you would type the postcode press F13 instead. Please note that tickets for foreign customers are sent abroad unless it is within 3 weeks of the match date, then they should be marked for collection on the address label.</p><p><strong>CHANGE OF CUSTOMER DETAILS<br /></strong>We can make amendments to the customer database for anyone who is NOT a STH. If a STH wishes to amend their address details etc. they need to write to the club.<br />If a STH is renewing his ST, then we can only take a booking if the ticket is to go to the permanent address held on the database. The club will only send to the address on the database. Any queries about needing to send to a temporary address should be referred to the club.<br />YOU MUST NOT OVERTYPE THE ADDRESS LABEL WITH AN ADDRESS DIFFERENT TO THAT REGISTERED ON THE SEASON TICKET HOLDER&#39;S CUSTOMER MAINTENANCE SCREEN IF YOU ARE SELLING THE SEASON TICKET HOLDER&#39;S OWN SEAT (FOR EXAMPLE IF IT&#39;S A CUP MATCH).</p><p><strong>SEASON TICKETS<br /></strong>Season Tickets; If you are adding a customer to the database and they are a concession, then they will have to send a copy of their birth certificate with their customer number to the club, before the club will send the ST out in the post. Season Ticket holders aged under 12 must be accompanied by an adult. ST&#39;s are posted ordinary 1st Class post&nbsp; in mid July. Customers CANNOT collect Season tickets and you CANNOT change the address label.</p><p><strong>ACCESS OUT OF HOURS<br /></strong>If customers need to&nbsp;take anything to the club&nbsp;i.e. ST renewals, out of ordinary operating hours, they can go round the corner of the ticket office where there is a door, ring the bell&nbsp; and the 24hr security people will take it off them.&nbsp; DO NOT put it under the door, otherwise it will get picked up by the cleaners and thrown away.</p><p><strong>ADDING CUSTOMERS TO THE DATABASE FOR A GENERAL SALE/CONCESSIONS</strong> <br />We can add Under 12&#39;s, Under 16, Under 22 and Over 65 Seniors&nbsp; to the database.<br />Age concessions apply as at 1st August. Supporters who book conc tix MAY be asked to provide proof of age on entering the ground.<br />&nbsp;The Salutation field MUST be completed, tickets will print without the name if it is not. All the other fields should be completed, please take e-mail addresses.<br />The club never sell a ticket before 10am on the day of the general sale. </p><p><strong>AWAY GAMES</strong><br />You must not sell home and away games on the same transaction.<br />Also, you MUST NOT SELL TWO DIFFERENT AWAY GAMES in the same transaction.<br />For an away game you have to type &quot;see text&quot; in the last two of the three blank ticket detail fields in the shopping basket (if more than one ticket is purchased you don&#39;t have to type &quot;see text&quot; more than once). Then you type the lead customer number&nbsp; and the quantity and type of tickets in the first line of the final address screen (next to the name), e.g. Mr J Bloggs (51080 x2A, X2J).<br />STH can send in a particular voucher to apply for tickets for an away game. If they want the tickets sent to them, they must enclosed a Stamped Address Envelope, if they don&#39;t, then the tickets will be held at Sunderland for them to collect not before a day before the general sale. Once on general sale, tickets are given out over the counter or posted automatically for all telephone bookings.<br />Because of the different rules at different clubs, we would say that U12&#39;s should not go to away matches unless accompanied by an adult.(1/8/6 MJ). Take the standard age for a junior as being 16 and Under for away matches unless told otherwise. (Maureen, 1/8/6)</p><p><strong>UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES</strong><br />Season Ticket holders who wish to upgrade for League matches (for which they will have a voucher) need to do this at the Sunderland ticket office on match day-at the club&#39;s discretion.<br />If it&#39;s a cup match and Season Ticket holders are calling to book their own seats (which are not included in their Season Ticket) and they want to upgrade or downgrade we&#39;d need to check that with the club.</p><p><strong>BABES-IN-ARMS</strong><br />It&#39;s fine for babies to sit on their parents&#39; laps but they still need a ticket even though they&#39;re not going to use a seat. Book any seat in a concessionary corner and charge it as a junior ticket (&pound;8) but explain that the customer obviously doesn&#39;t need to use that specific seat. Equally don&#39;t allow the customer to be under the impression that a seat is booked next to their seats on which they could put the baby down if that&#39;s not the case!! There is no room for buggies etc!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>WHEELCHAIR</strong>;&nbsp; we are unable to book w/c spaces. Call customer services (see above) W/c pays appropriate price, helper goes free.</p><p><strong>LOST TICKETS</strong><br />If a customer calls and says that the tickets have not arrived you should check the purchase history. Once you&#39;re sure they were booked for the correct match, the customer should be advised to ring customer services a day or two before the match. Duplicates are only ever issued on the match day.</p><p><strong>ON-SALE TIME</strong><br />On the first day of sales for a particular match we can&#39;t sell any tickets until 10am.</p><p><strong>PAYMENT<br /></strong>All types of credit/debit card accepted except Electron (can be used for counter sales only) and American Express.</p><p><strong>BOOKING FEES</strong><br />There is a booking fee on EVERY TICKET BOOKED, and this needs to be applied as a separate product code. A09TZB.<br />Don&#39;t forget to type the customer number when you pick the booking fee (rather than putting it through generically), otherwise you&#39;ll get to the address screen and there&#39;ll be no details!<br />You MUST quote the booking fees to the customer and make it clear that there is a fee on each ticket.&nbsp; &pound;1.25 per ticket on telephone &amp; internet bookings. However, the club DO NOT CHARGE FEES FOR ANY OVER THE COUNTER BOOKING.</p><p><strong>SPORTS BAR, DURHAM SUITE</strong> <br />0191 551 5000 number (the main switchboard), ask for corporate. </p><p><strong>BLACK CATS BAR<br /></strong>This opens at 12pm on 3pm k/o matchdays, 10am on 12.45pm k/o&nbsp;matchdays and 6pm for evening k/o matchdays.

All bookings that have been approved will become &lsquo;Authorised/Current&#39; until the next overnight run, when they will archive. A booking that has not been approved will return to being &lsquo;Failed/Current&#39; when the procedure has been completed and will not be submitted again until it has been retrieved &amp; updated by an operator, the system <u>will not</u> keep trying to obtain clearance. So if you come across a booking from a few days ago that is still Failed and/or ____/current and Pceft has been run in the intervening time <u>you must</u> retrieve and update to take the money and complete the sale. </p><p><strong>From - Important on the Intranet </strong>- the day and time is when the bookings were &lsquo;picked up&#39; for the Pceft run and Emma only puts this on the Intranet when the procedure has been completed. </p><p align="\"><strong>Authorised/Current</strong> &nbsp;You cannot makes changes to this status of booking.
