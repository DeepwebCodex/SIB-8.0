1001 Abelia chinensis Caprifoliaceae a-BEEL-ee-a chin-EN-sis Chinese Abelia shrub Niche special meadow-shade Shrub with arching stems bearing clusters of butterfly-attracting white flowers Cuttings from garden plant. Cuttings, tip cuttings or stem cuttings, 2-6 " long. The earlier the better. Mist. Somewhat difficult to root and slow-growing. Pot to quarts and overwinter in quarts in sunny house. Don't overwater. Once described by the Raulston Arboretum as attracting more butterflies than any other plant in their garden. In midsummer, large trusses of fragrant, creamy-white flowers bend the stems into graceful curves; butterflies nectar wildly! Grows 5-8' in full sun and well-drained soils. Not a "new" plant, but uncommon in gardens -- possibly because its cousin Abelia x grandiflora is considered more cold hardy. A. chinensis winter-hardiness is proven by the specimen growing happily at the Brooklyn Botanical Garden.

1002 Abelia x grandiflora Sunrise Caprifoliaceae a-BEEL-ee-a  gran-di-FLOR-a Variegated Abelia shrub patented 'Sunrise' is an exciting new variegated Abelia that was discovered, developed and patented by Taylor's Nursery in Raleigh, NC. Variegation appears as a bright yellow margin around each leaf and is stable in full sun to heavy shade. Growth is dense and compact. Flowers, like small white trumpets spread along the stems, attract bees and butterflies. Bloom season is long, and branches are nice in arrangements. According to Michael Dirr of the University of GA, 'Sunrise' promises to be a beautiful new shrub for zones 7 and south. Abelia is heat and drought tolerant and widely useful across the southeast and into TX and CA. Taylor's sets a fine example for all nurseries by donating royalties from sales of Abelia 'Sunrise' to the J. C. Raulston Arboretum at NC State University. Enjoy these many good reasons for adding this fine new summer-blooming shrub to your garden.

1003 Acanthus hungaricus Acanthaceae a-KAN-thus hun-GARE-i-kus Bear's Breeches perennial Jelitto Long-lasting flower stalks above bold foliage 2002. Easy from root cuttings. Remove plants from quarts, knock off soil and cut 2-3" lengths of largest and medium size roots. Stack in pile with top end up. At l east 50% of roots can be taken without any ill effects to plant. Repot plant. In large flat  lay roots at about a 45 degree angle, in rows with soil between the rows. Eight or ten rows per flat. Cover exposed top ends of roots with half-inch of soil. Keep out of intense sun and keep damp, but not soaking. Seems to work most times of year, especially fall. Take cuttings when number of quarts gets down to 60-100. The broad lobed leaves of Acanthus have long inspired important decorative features in Western art and architecture. Bold foliage is further enhanced in early summer when stiff flower spikes bearing hooded gray-purple flowers rise 2-3' above the leaves. In bloom, its intricate beauty will stop you in your tracks. Flower spikes are quite long-lasting. Plant in well-drained soil in full sun or in partial shade in the South. This 3-4' perennial is useful at the middle of the garden or as a central feature in island beds. Although it's slow to become established, the patient gardener will not be disappointed. true acanthus_hungaricus H=3-4' S=3' true true false <sym SUN><sym PS> 5 9 Z.5-9 rich well-drained false false false true true true false true false false true <sym CF><sym DF><sym DH><sym BF><sym DT> early-summer 32 gray-purple b false false false false Qt.

Same as Acanthus hungaricus. A lush and vigorous cross, likely between A. mollis and A. spinosus, ‘Summer Beauty’ is considered the best Acanthus for hot southern climates. Fills the woodland border with a profusion of broadly lobed glossy-green leaves. Acanthus foliage inspired the leaf motif seen in the capitals of Corinthian columns and other classical ornamentation. Dramatic bloom spikes arise in summer — pagodas of large white flowers with dusky purple hooded calyces.

Huge leaves lend a lush feel to temperate gardens and woodlands. In early spring, leathery maroon flowers dangle from bare stems and are pollinated by flies and beetles. Oblong fruit is the largest native to N. America: custardy pulp with a floral banana-like flavor surrounding large brown seeds. Typically forms a clonal patch in the wild, but can be trained as a single pyramidal tree. Flowers and fruits best with more sun, and requires two or more individuals for pollination.

Haven't tried seed yet. Cuttings have been easy. Because of late bloom, cuttings can be taken later than other asters, as late as mid-August. Large plant on mailbox. Mist. Roots in 4 weeks. This amazing woody aster behaves like a climbing rose, and can be trellised or left to scramble along a fence. Loads of rich-pink buds pop open to reveal spidery rose-lilac flowers in fall.

In spring an impressive mass of native Green and Gold emerged in his Pittsboro, NC garden and soon showed its colors: a green carpet, dotted with tiny yet copious bright golden flowers, fading to a buttery yellow and finally a creamy white. I had never seen three different flower colors on Green and Gold, WOW! In collaboration with Sunny Border Nursery, this Chrysogonum was trialed, propagated and made available to the gardening public. Jerry has since passed away, but he knew this plant was in the works, and 'Quinn's Gold' is his legacy to gardening. A woodland native which will adapt to various soil types; drought-tolerant but will flourish in moist amended soils.

1881 Saccharum officinarum Pele's Smoke Poaceae SACK-er-um oh-fish-ee-NARE-um Purple Sugar Cane grass Bodacious annual grass, towers quickly to 6-8' in the summer 2002. Temperature sensitive. GH stock plants. Or take stem cuttings from gdn plants before frost and cut into sections one node each. Lower node in soil of Kadon flat, perhaps 100 per flat. Enclose entire flat in plastic and put on bottom heat. Should leaf out in a few weeks. Prone to rotting in mid winter, especially if too cool. Pot 3-4 sections per gallon in April. Perhaps stem cuttings from GH stock plants could be done in March with same results. Olive-green and mauve tints (which read as muted purple in the garden) color the 1" wide leaves of this bodacious Sugar Cane.  It's a wonderful annual grass to use as a screen, an accent or at the back of the sunny border, as it quickly towers to 6-8' and rustles in summer and fall breezes. When planting, make sure you have a way to get close to this plant to enjoy its colorful beauty.  It's never flowered in our area, but that's fine; the foliage keeps me content all summer long.

1001 Abelia chinensis Caprifoliaceae a-BEEL-ee-a chin-EN-sis Abelia shrub Niche Meadow Giants West Shrub with arching stems bearing clusters of butterfly-attracting white flowers Cuttings from garden plant. Cuttings, tip cuttings or stem cuttings, 2-6 " long. The earlier the better. Mist. Somewhat difficult to root and slow-growing. Pot to quarts and overwinter in quarts in sunny house. Don't overwater. The JC Raulston Arboretum describes this shrub as attracting more butterflies than any other plant in the garden. In midsummer, large fragrant trusses of creamy-white flowers bend stems into graceful curves; butterflies nectar wildly. Grows 5-8' in full sun and well-drained soils. Although this is not a "new" plant, it is rarely seen in gardens, possibly because its cousin, Abelia x grandiflora, is considered more cold hardy.

1002 Abelia x grandiflora Sunrise Caprifoliaceae a-BEEL-ee-a  gran-di-FLOR-a Variegated Abelia shrub 'Sunrise' is an exciting new variegated Abelia that was discovered, developed and patented by Taylor's Nursery in Raleigh, NC. Variegation appears as a bright yellow margin around each leaf and is stable in full sun to heavy shade. Growth is dense and compact. Flowers, like small white trumpets spread along the stems, attract bees and butterflies. Bloom season is long, and branches are nice in arrangements. According to Michael Dirr of the University of GA, 'Sunrise' promises to be a beautiful new shrub for zones 7 and south. Abelia is heat and drought tolerant and widely useful across the southeast and into TX and CA. Taylor's sets a fine example for all nurseries by donating royalties from sales of Abelia 'Sunrise' to the J. C. Raulston Arboretum at NC State University.

1003 Acanthus hungaricus Acanthaceae a-KAN-thus hun-GARE-i-kus Bear's Breeches perennial Jelitto Long-lasting flower stalks above bold foliage 2002. Easy from root cuttings. Remove plants from quarts, knock off soil and cut 2-3" lengths of largest and medium size roots. Stack in pile with top end up. At l east 50% of roots can be taken without any ill effects to plant. Repot plant. In large flat  lay roots at about a 45 degree angle, in rows with soil between the rows. Eight or ten rows per flat. Cover exposed top ends of roots with half-inch of soil. Keep out of intense sun and keep damp, but not soaking. Seems to work most times of year, especially fall. Take cuttings when number of quarts gets down to 60-100. The broad lobed leaves of Acanthus have long inspired important decorative features in Western art and architecture. The bold foliage is further enhanced in early summer when stiff flower spikes bearing hooded gray-purple flowers rise 2-3' above the leaves. In bloom, its intricate beauty will stop you in your tracks. Flower spikes are quite long-lasting. Plant in well-drained soil in full sun or in partial shade in the South. This 3-4' perennial is useful at the middle of the garden or as a central feature in island beds. Although it's slow to become established, the patient gardener will not be disappointed.

However, this selection, like H. 'Chocolate Ruffles' and H.'Ruby Veil,' doesn't have this problem.  Gardeners in the North can grow this heuchera in sun, while southern gardeners need to plant in a lightly shaded area. 'Bressingham Bronze' foliage grows into an attractive dense mound of 1-2'.

Like other Tiarellas, it is an excellent native groundcover for shady areas and woodland gardens. 'Elizabeth' forms a low mat and spreads by runners to form a dense patch. Taller woodland plants will grow through the foliage so it is great to mix with ferns, Bluebells and other woodland ephemerals. In spring, light pink flowers open atop 1' tall wands.

1881 Saccharum officinarum Pele's Smoke Poaceae SACK-er-um oh-fish-ee-NARE-um Purple Sugar Cane grass Bodacious annual grass, towers quickly to 6-8' in the summer 2002. Temperature sensitive. GH stock plants. Or take stem cuttings from gdn plants before frost and cut into sections one node each. Lower node in soil of Kadon flat, perhaps 100 per flat. Enclose entire flat in plastic and put on bottom heat. Should leaf out in a few weeks. Prone to rotting in mid winter, especially if too cool. Pot 3-4 sections per gallon in April. Perhaps stem cuttings from GH stock plants could be done in March with same results. Olive-green and mauve tints (which read as muted purple in the garden) color the 1" wide leaves of this bodacious Sugar Cane.  It's a wonderful annual grass to use as a screen, an accent or at the back of the sunny border, as it quickly towers to 6-8' and rustles in summer and fall breezes. When planting, make sure you have a way to get close to this plant to enjoy its colorful beauty.  It's never flowered in our area, but that's fine; the foliage keeps me content all summer long.

1001 Abelia chinensis Caprifoliaceae a-BEEL-ee-a chin-EN-sis Abelia shrub Niche Meadow Giants West Shrub with arching stems bearing clusters of butterfly-attracting white flowers Cuttings from garden plant. Cuttings, tip cuttings or stem cuttings, 2-6 " long. The earlier the better. Mist. Somewhat difficult to root and slow-growing. Pot to quarts and overwinter in quarts in sunny house. Don't overwater. The JC Raulston Arboretum describes this shrub as attracting more butterflies than any other plant in the garden. In midsummer, large fragrant trusses of creamy-white flowers bend stems into graceful curves; butterflies nectar wildly. Grows 5-8' in full sun and well-drained soils. Although this is not a "new" plant, it is rarely seen in gardens, possibly because its cousin, Abelia x grandiflora, is considered more cold hardy.

1002 Abelia x grandiflora Sunrise Caprifoliaceae a-BEEL-ee-a  gran-di-FLOR-a Variegated Abelia shrub shrub 'Sunrise' is an exciting new variegated Abelia that was discovered, developed and patented by Taylor's Nursery in Raleigh, NC. Variegation appears as a bright yellow margin around each leaf and is stable in full sun to heavy shade. Growth is dense and compact. Flowers, like small white trumpets spread along the stems, attract bees and butterflies. Bloom season is long, and branches are nice in arrangements. According to Michael Dirr of the University of GA, 'Sunrise' promises to be a beautiful new shrub for zones 7 and south. Abelia is heat and drought tolerant and widely useful across the southeast and into TX and CA. Taylor's sets a fine example for all nurseries by donating royalties from sales of Abelia 'Sunrise' to the J. C. Raulston Arboretum at NC State University.

1003 Acanthus hungaricus Acanthaceae a-KAN-thus hun-GARE-i-kus Bear's Breeches perennial Jelitto Long-lasting flower stalks above bold foliage 2002. Easy from root cuttings. Remove plants from quarts, knock off soil and cut 2-3" lengths of largest and medium size roots. Stack in pile with top end up. At l east 50% of roots can be taken without any ill effects to plant. Repot plant. In large flat  lay roots at about a 45 degree angle, in rows with soil between the rows. Eight or ten rows per flat. Cover exposed top ends of roots with half-inch of soil. Keep out of intense sun and keep damp, but not soaking. Seems to work most times of year, especially fall. Take cuttings when number of quarts gets down to 60-100. The broad lobed leaves of Acanthus have long inspired important decorative features in Western art and architecture. The bold foliage is further enhanced in early summer when stiff flower spikes bearing hooded gray-purple flowers rise 2-3' above the leaves. In bloom, its intricate beauty will stop you in your tracks. Flower spikes are quite long-lasting. Plant in well-drained soil in full sun or in partial shade in the South.

This softly sprawling Aster provides a delicate carpet of snowflakes, blending naturally with Gingers, mosses, Partridgeberry and ferns. The small but numerous flowers have single white petals and yellow centers. Blooms fade to shades of subtle burgundy and rose-pink. Black, twiggy stems provide a strong contrast to white flowers and are quite showy as well. Seeds in (deadhead if not desired) and rambles in the woodland garden or in partial sun.

2480 Gaillardia x grandiflora Torchlight Asteraceae ga-LAR-dee-ah grand-eh-FLOOR-ah Blanket Flower perennial Jelitto seed grown from Jelitto Gaillardia is a hardy and highly drought-tolerant perennial, with several species growing throughout the US. 'Torchlight' is a cross between the Western G. aristata and the Eastern G. pulchella, and a great performer for hot, well-drained areas. We've found it to tolerate our Southern humidity, and love its large, dark red blooms with wide yellow tips, perched atop sturdy 2-3' stems. 'Torchlight' is quite vigorous and low-maintenance, giving months of hot summer color.

2481 Gaillardia x grandiflora Primavera Asteraceae Blanket Flower perennial Jelitto Jelitto seed strain seed grown from Jelitto Gaillardia is a hardy and highly drought-tolerant perennial. Native to the Rocky Mountain states and north into Canada, it is often found growing wild on the sand dunes of East Coast beaches. As you might expect, it needs very lean well-drained soil. It is tolerant of our southern heat and humidity, but not heavy clay soils.  Primavera is an early flowering hybrid with a compact habit and a particularly long bloom period. It has large bi-colored flowers of bright red with yellow tips. A low maintenance plant for xeric gardens, containers and sandy soils, Primavera will give you months of hot summer color.

1442 Heuchera x Chocolate Ruffles Saxifragaceae HEW-ker-a Chocolate Ruffles Alumroot perennial The evergreen foliage of this 16" alumroot is chocolate-colored and ruffled, hence the common name.

1443 Heuchera micrantha Bressingham Bronze Saxifragaceae HEW-ker-a  my-KRAN-tha Bressingham Bronze Alumroot perennial This patented Coralbells traveled across the great Atlantic from the nursery of Alan Bloom in England.  The leaves are somewhat crinkled and have five-pointed lobes that resemble a maple leaf. Sometimes the red pigments that give heucheras a burgundy color fade to green when temperatures stay above 70 degrees at night (which means most of the summer here in the piedmont of NC and the South in general).  However, this selection, like H. 'Chocolate Ruffles' and H.'Ruby Veil,' doesn't have this problem.  Gardeners in the North can grow this heuchera in sun, while southern gardeners need to plant in a lightly shaded area. 'Bressingham Bronze' foliage grows into an attractive dense mound of 1-2'.

Like other Tiarellas, it is an excellent native groundcover for shady areas and woodland gardens. 'Elizabeth' forms a low mat and spreads by runners to form a dense patch. Taller woodland plants will grow through the foliage so it is great to mix with ferns, Bluebells and other woodland ephemerals. In spring, light pink flowers open atop 1' tall wands.

1881 Saccharum officinarum Pele's Smoke Poaceae SACK-er-um oh-fish-ee-NARE-um Purple Sugar Cane grass grass Bodacious annual grass, towers quickly to 6-8' in the summer 2002. Temperature sensitive. GH stock plants. Or take stem cuttings from gdn plants before frost and cut into sections one node each. Lower node in soil of Kadon flat, perhaps 100 per flat. Enclose entire flat in plastic and put on bottom heat. Should leaf out in a few weeks. Prone to rotting in mid winter, especially if too cool. Pot 3-4 sections per gallon in April. Perhaps stem cuttings from GH stock plants could be done in March with same results. Olive-green and mauve tints (which read as muted purple in the garden) color the 1" wide leaves of this bodacious Sugar Cane.  It's a wonderful annual grass to use as a screen, an accent or at the back of the sunny border, as it quickly towers to 6-8' and rustles in summer and fall breezes. When planting, make sure you have a way to get close to this plant to enjoy its colorful beauty.  It's never flowered in our area, but that's fine; the foliage keeps me content all summer long.  It abhors frost; cut back pre-frost, pot and bring indoors to a sunny window during winter. Or, leave the overwintering to us and reorder in the spring!
