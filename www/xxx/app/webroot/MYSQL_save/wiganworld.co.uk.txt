The gent on the left must be Elsie's father who I never knew. Elsie Almond married a gent named Dick Burgess and they had two children, one named Silvia who married a gent named Derek Lee who is now deceased." 2007-03-26 16:17:56 0 82.33.129.62

1035 4173 John Brown Hello again Ken.
Thanks for your helpful reply.I have downloaded a picture of my Grandmother just out of interest for you. The Mrs Carter in your pic doesn't look like her to me, but the ages would be about the same I think. No matter, maybe the street was swarming with Carters, you never know ! It's a fascinating picture anyway - compare Sally's clothes with some of the other girls' - times were tough then I reckon, and some must have struggled. Once again,thanks, and if you have any more photos please put them on. 2007-11-02 11:38:19 0 82.33.173.216

1 1 1 Brian 2006-05-05 16:10:56 Welcome to wiganworld <div class="newsshadowedr"><img src="images/welcome.gif"></div>Welcome to a new look website, I hope you like it.

wiganworld has moved to a new server. It should be quicker and more reliable. I also had to re-write the whole site so there may be bits missing, or not quite ready yet. I am aware of 'missing' pages and am currently working flat out to publish them.

Unfortunately I was unable to transfer the users data across. In order to post, you will need to re-register. I apologise for any inconvenience.

New and improved features coming soon include:
<ul><li>Upload several photos to your profile</li><p><li>Classifieds with images (free)</li><p><li>What's On / Days Out</li><p><li>Blogging</li></ul>
As everything is being ported across, my email may stop working for a day or two - aahhh, peace ;o)

If you have any comments (good or bad) you can leave them here or in the guestbook, thank you. Registration is no longer required to leave your comments in this blog. 0
6 1 1 mandie 2006-05-06 14:15:33 the new site looks great brian,well done keep up all the good work 62.30.38.64 0
7 1 7 Brian 2006-05-06 23:31:13 Recent Survey... <div class="newsshadowedr"><img src="/ww5/wwlogo.gif"></div>Thank you to everyone who helped with the recent survey, here is the feedback:

<b>Blogging</b>
I was quite surprised by the amount of people that didn't know what a blog was. Wikipedia explains it quite well <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog" class="textlink" target="_blank">here</a>. 

Did you know that by reading this, you are reading a blog? Anyway, most people wanted to see blogging so I will phase it in.

<b>Classifieds</b>
Majority said YES. Others showed concern that it would take too long to update. It will be automated, so once written and live it will take very little of my time. Classifieds is coming soon.

<b>Events</b>
Again, majority said YES. I'm going to create a new what's on guide which I hope people will use.

<b>Court Results</b>
Interesting one this... Seems to be 50/50. I'm going to leave it for now as it would cost £150 per month to get the results. If someone wanted to sponsor the page (perhaps a local Solicitors?) then I would do it.

<b>Dating</b>
Again, 50/50. Will give it a little space in the classifieds to see how it goes.

<b>What is Missing?</b>
Here goes... Hobbies, Charities, Search, Help sending old photos, District news (good news), Surname history, Chatroom, More street photos, make the site more colourful etc etc.

Hobbies - Perhaps the blog will cover this? 

Charities - wiganworld and its generous visitors have donated hundreds of pounds to local charity. Hundreds more will be donated in a few months from wiganworld. I will set up a local charity page in a few months with a voting system to let you decide where the money should go. Watch this space.

Search - This has come up in the past, and yes, I agree its needed. I never added this before because the site was hosted on a Micro$oft box and the security risks were too great. It could be a possibility in the future?

Help sending old photos - If you're local email me.

District News (good news) - I would need help here, again the blog would cover this.

Surname History - Agreed, the more history the better.

Chat Room - Hmmm, not sure.

More Street Photos - Yes, they're on the way. Tony Haslam is photographing Billinge Streets at the mo.. I will be out and about soon. I hope to complete it this year.

Make ww more colourful - Just had a re-write, but I prefer a clean look and feel. Simple to use and clutter-free. Sorry! 0
3 1 1 Dave Marsh 2006-05-05 22:41:28 Undoubtedly the best site of its kind on the internet.Brian at his best.Good luck and thank you for all the happy hours spent browsing. 82.112.145.52 0

You keep doing it, making things happen for us. I am indebted to you for the pictures of Wigan streets, that make my home sickness more bearable, and this site makes life much better for me, for undoubtably Wigan and its folk are among the best in the entire world, and I have travelled a lot. 222.153.77.224 0

10 1 7 susan allcock 2006-05-07 14:04:53 hi,  took me a while to realise this was a new site but i got here eventually.  I love this site but please, don't add dating or chat rooms,  there is enough of them already on the net we don't need them here.  This site should stick to being about us Wiganers and surrounding districts with all our news and views and not somewhere to get yourself a partner. 88.110.43.242 0
11 1 11 Brian 2006-05-07 22:16:51 Chronology, 1909 Year 1909 added to <a href="/stuff/chrono.php?opt=chrono" class="textlink">Wigan Chronology</a>. 0

101 1 101 Brian 2006-08-11 20:50:39 Court Leet Roll Added another <a href="/stuff/leet.php?opt=leet" class="textlink">Court Leet Roll</a> for 1659 to 1660, Roll 15. 0
102 1 102 Brian 2006-08-15 22:57:12 In the pipeline Lots of updates soon. I'm busy offline typing, programming and gathering data to add to wiganworld.

The Court Leet Rolls are keeping me busy at the moment. I have typed in another 2 rolls and am racing my way through the 600 page monster! Will add a batch soon.

Also, thanks to the Friends of Wigan Heritage Service - in particular <b>Freda Chorlton</b> and <b>Gerald Marsden</b> - wiganworld will soon have the Wigan Cemetery (Lower Ince) Index online. There are over 60,000 burials from 1856 to 1915 listed. It will be searchable by surname. Anyone seeking more info will be able to contact the History Shop in Wigan. More years will be added as and when they have been transcribed.

If thats not enough for local historians, Freda has provided a street guide for 1890 in a similar format to the 1933 street guide already on the site.

Plus, many old album photos to add. 

Watch this space. 0
103 1 103 Brian 2006-08-16 20:04:45 Updates Added another couple of <a href="/stuff/leet.php?opt=leet" class="textlink">Court Leet Rolls<a/>. Rolls 16 and 17 cover the years 1660 to 1662.

Also, thanks to Freda Chorlton for supplying another street index, this time for 1890 compliled from Haslam's Directory with additions from Wigan Burial Register.

104 1 98 Beth Dewhurst 2006-08-17 17:38:37 Just to say how much I love this web-site. As an Wigan ex-pat it gives me a connection with my family who were all from Wigan, but alas no longer with us. I have nieces and nephews there who don't feel the need to keep in touch. Shame really, because I do a lot of different things to do with traditional music and would like to have shared it!

Many thanks again for your time. 80.42.199.246 0
105 1 105 Brian 2006-08-17 19:24:29 Wigan Cemetery <div class="newsshadowedr"><img src="images/cemetery.jpg"></div>The Wigan Cemetery (Lower Ince) Records Index has been added.

Many thanks to the Friends of Wigan Heritage Service, in particular Freda Chorlton and Gerald Marsden for their hard work in producing the index.

There are over 62,000 names in the database. A simple search has been provided, which will list the results in surname and year order.

The microfilms are held at the History Shop in Wigan where further information (eg plot number) can be obtained.

106 1 105 Christi. 2006-08-18 11:03:57 I have just "comeback" to Wigan World after loosing my password.  Having read the newly added part of the Wigan cemetery index, how sad it makes the heart feel. So MANY childred dying, and people dying in workhouses or assylum! Many of these away from the family at such a critical time. Yet in today's world it lifts my heart again to think that no matter what, I still have MY family!  Thank Goodness.  Christi. 84.69.248.231 0

1 news 2005-01-22 22:50:48 1 People Power - Your Views Can Change Lives Wanted: 500 people who care about life in our borough and want to help shape the future of the services that affect us all.<BR> <BR> Its one of Wigan Boroughs most influential groups and proof positive that anyone can have their say and opinions matter.<BR> <BR> The councilbacked Citizens Panel has been helping to make big changes in the borough over the past few years. It has had a big effect on how the council and other organisations providing services to residents do business.<BR> <BR> Now the team behind it is looking for more residents with something to say to get involved.<BR> <BR> Membership of the panel is being updated and invitations are currently going out to a random selection of people in a bid to recruit 500 new members.<BR> <BR> The 1,500strong forum was set up more than three years ago. Its membership is drawn from all parts of the borough and from all walks of life.<BR> <BR> Members are asked for their views on services and how they think they can be improved in the future on a regular basis.<BR> <BR> People living in the borough who get a letter inviting them to join are being urged to think seriously about the chance to have a real impact on the shape of public services.<BR> <BR> Panel organiser Tracy Bennett said that since it began, it has brought about real change and helped introduce a number of new ideas that are making the borough a better place. Tracy said:<BR> <BR> The Citizens Panel has played an important role in many areas. For example, the panel gave us its view in 2001 about how members liked to receive information about the council through the letterbox. We spoke to a group of them about setting up a residents magazine and their views helped us develop Borough Life.<BR> <BR> Each year we ask the panel what it thinks of the magazine and how it can be improved. We make improvements based on this feedback."<BR> <BR> She added:<BR> <BR> The panel has helped us develop a longterm plan for leisure in the borough including plans for a new look and new locations for libraries, to offer free swimming for under 16s and proposals for two new swimming pools.<BR> <BR> The panel has given its views on important issues such as plans for childrens health services, which will be fed into Greater Manchester-wide consultation this summer.<BR> <BR> Members of the panel are asked for their views at least four times a year through a postal survey.<BR> <BR> Each survey asks for their thoughts on at least four different services and takes between 30 minutes and an hour to complete.<BR> <BR> There are also discussion groups and telephone surveys from time to time and members are kept up to date on how their comments are used through a regular newsletter.<BR> <BR> Some typical reasons people have given for joining the panel in the past include:<BR> <BR> I wanted to make a change.<BR> <BR> I wanted to have input into what goes on in the community.<BR> <BR> I had serious issues that I wanted addressed and thought this would be good in some way.<BR> <BR> I thought it could help in some way.<BR> <BR> Tracy said:<BR> <BR> You could be a student or you could be retired. You could be born and bred in Wigan borough or only recently made it your home, we want to hear from everyone.<BR> <BR> This year we especially want to hear from people aged 18 to 24 or over 75 and from people from ethnic backgrounds. 0 brian/peoplepower.jpg <b>Top Read</b>: Residents now get the news and views on council issues important to them thanks to the Citizens' Panel-inspired Borough Life.

3 news 2005-01-23 14:14:58 3 Window On Wigan - Tourism Top Shop Comes To Town From Spring 2005 tourism is going to be the centre of attention in Wigan when it's given its own prime location.The Tourist Information Centre (TIC) has been looking for a new home for a number of years. And now managers are confident that they have found the right venue with an exciting shop-front development on Wallgate.<BR> <BR> The move coincides with the redevelopment of the Trencherfield Mill site where the TIC is located at present. From next Spring the Mill will form part of the regeneration of the area from a heritage attraction to a wider cultural quarter. The TIC is part of a national tourist information network and will be relocated to Wallgate just opposite Wigan North Western Station. Tourism chiefs in the borough are confident that the new site will bring the opportunity to expand and improve the service.<BR> <BR> Wigan's Tourism Development Manager Keith Bergman said: "There is increasing competition from virtual and high street sources of information.<BR> <BR> "It is important for TICs to become financially self-sustaining by providing modern services.<BR> <BR> "To do this we must be in the town centre where there are more people and we are closer to popular shopping centres and the railway and bus stations."Once open, the centre will provide a range of new services, including the country's first ever e-tourism centre. Visitors to the centre will be able to get their hands on all the information they need about where to stay in the borough, events and places to eat and drink. Tourism students will be able to look at reports, industry statistics and careers' information.<BR> <BR> While leisure and tourism managers will be able to get the low down on information to help them with decision making, planning and investment.<BR> Mr Bergman said: "We will be investing in the technology, staff and facilities in order to provide an upgraded service to the fast-growing number of town centre visitors. We will also be in a better position to support new developments such as the Pier Quarter and existing local attractions like Haigh Hall, Pennington Flash and the JJB."<BR> <BR> He added: "The centre will be contemporary in both its look and the services it provides. It is a very exciting development and it is groundbreaking not just for Wigan but for the entire region."<BR> <BR> The new TIC will have a greater emphasis on generating its own income by providing a local, regional and national event ticket office. It will sell locally produced goods and also be a one-stop travel shop selling everything from maps and guidebooks to travel plugs and irons. The centre will provide a travel agency specialising in short breaks and coach and rail travel. The TIC will also include a broker service for the borough's hotel and conference trade.<BR> <BR> Chief Executive of Wigan Leisure & Culture Trust Rodney Hill said: "The new TIC is just one element of the borough's planned cultural investment. Once it opens we should see other developments start to take shape such as the Wigan Pier Quarter with its new hotel, visitor attractions, restaurant, pub and a fantastic new performance venue.<BR> <BR> "There will be the opening of the Grand Arcade shopping centre, the wonderful facilities at Leigh Sports Village and the new developments at Robin Park. "Wigan TIC needs to be strengthened in order to support these developments today and tomorrow." 0 brian/tic.jpg New Look: Artist's Impression of the Wigan TIC

So much so that hes become the latest winner of The Sack Race, Wigan Councils competition for paper recyclers.<BR> <BR> Funded by the governments waste and resource action programme, the competition awards shopping vouchers to a household taking part in the councils kerbside collection scheme. The mayor draws each months winning address at random from a recycling sack.<BR> <BR> Previous recycling champs have been in Aspull, Hindley Green and Beech Hill. And this month, Steve, of Blenheim Street, Tyldesley, found it was his turn. He said:<BR> <BR> At home, we always recycle our old papers and magazines, said Steve, who is now £500 richer, and Ill be reminding friends and family to keep putting their sack out for their chance to win the cash.<BR> <BR> After initial surprise and disbelief that hed won, fireman Steve invited green team member Ruth Halpin to the fire station for the presentation. She said:<BR> <BR> Well done to Steve  this is his reward for saving precious resources from the landfill. We want to see all residents giving us their old catalogues and magazines, in the sack every two weeks on bin day. It saves everyones money and everyones environment!<BR> <BR> The government-funded campaign has increased recycling rates in the borough and council bosses are continuing to develop strategies to reach out to those who are not yet using the kerbside collection services.

This week is national Real Nappy Week and Wigan Council is out to promote alternatives to the throwaway society.<BR> <BR> The councils People and Places team is joining forces with Cottontails, one of several nappy laundry services in the area, to highlight the sustainable choice available to local parents. Cottontails offers a door-to-door collection and delivery service, supplying customers with odour free containers and 100% cotton chemical free nappies. Its the kind of service the council wants to promote.<BR> <BR> Wigan Councils People and Places Manager, Nick Burdekin says:<BR> <BR> Every day in Britain, eight million nappies are used and thrown away. Whats worse is that they are made from 65% wood pulp and 35% petroleum derived synthetic materials and gels, and each one will take over two hundred years to decompose. I want to make parents aware of alternatives.<BR> <BR> One happy Cottontails customer is two months old Martin Gündher from Swinley, whose family now get fresh nappies delivered to their home and dirty ones taken away for washing  saving time, money and valuable resources.<BR> <BR> Martins mum and dad were attracted to the convenience of having nappies collected from their home, often for less than the cost of buying disposables. But cost wasnt the only factor  mum Petra also wanted to give her baby a green start to life, and was impressed by the friendly laundry service. She says:<BR> <BR> These soft nappies dont have pins, they are safe and fit snug inside a waterproof outer wrap. I enjoy spending time with my baby and think that nappy changing is a lovely part of the bonding process.<BR> <BR> Anybody who wants to find out more and to see if they qualify for a free months trial should telephone (01244) 374521. 0 brian/nappies.jpg <b>Look, no pins</b>!

For a call out fee of just £10 our teams will take away and responsibly dispose of up to seven items of bulky waste.<BR> <BR> This cost compares with £15 on the Wirral and £17 in Salford.<BR> <BR> Fly-tipping now attracts fines of up to £50,000 since the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act came into effect this month. Littering is now illegal in all open spaces, closing a loophole which previously meant it was not an offence to drop litter on other peoples property.<BR> <BR> The councils cleansing team is on the front line of picking up rubbish and has seen fly-tipping increase first hand.<BR> <BR> A dedicated new team has been assembled to police the problem, but, as experienced cleansing operative Ken Littler says, the concern is for children.<BR> <BR> A broken cupboard, fridge or chemical drum left in a ditch could easily become a deathtrap for kids playing, says Ken. For the £10 it costs to get us to collect it would you want a tragedy on your conscience?<BR> <BR> Fridges contain harmful chemicals and valuable metals, all of which can be reclaimed. Such items collected in Wigan are all stripped for re-use, which saves resources and contributes to tough government recycling targets placed on everyone in the borough.<BR> <BR> The cleansing team will collect up to seven items of bulky material, such as free standing furniture, for £10.

It joins a small but growing band of totally smoke free food premises in Wigan, such as The Scene, Café Select, and the Beta Net Café.<BR> <BR> Welcoming the news, the councils director of community protection Bob Saunders said he was sure proprietor Howard Gallimores smoke free policy would attract diners to the new restaurant. Mr Saunders added:<BR> <BR> Many towns and cities around the world now require people not to smoke in enclosed places. One year into smoke freedom in Southern Ireland most customers, publicans and restaurateurs say they wouldnt want to return to the smokey days.<BR> <BR> Smoke free enclosed places means that all workers, even bar and restaurant staff can work in a smoke free atmosphere.<BR> <BR> While local authorities across the north west are now looking at the possibility of going smoke free, enterprising restaurateurs are already taking matters into their own hands and asking customers to stub out before they step in.<BR> <BR> While many places now provide non-smoking areas, fewer have yet to ban smoking totally. With smokers in a minority of the population as a whole, Wigan Council says it is keen to see more diners having a choice of totally smoke free venues. 0

They were both pushing prams with their then two-year-old and five-month-old sons in them.<br><br>Just before midnight a man carrying a long bag over his shoulder approached them on the street. The 30-year-old recognised the man as Devenny.<br><br>Devenny spoke to the man before producing the shotgun from the bag, pointing it at him and his girlfriend. He warned the man's girlfriend to get out of the way, telling her that the gun was loaded.<br><br>The 30-year-old pushed the two prams away from Devenny. Pointing the gun at him, Devenny told the 30-year-old "I'm going to shoot you, I'm going to kill you."

504 news 2007-03-06 18:11:59 3 Wigan Skipper Arjan De Zeeuw Launches Reading Stars Scheme Wigan Athletic's Arjan De Zeeuw is one of the Premier League's most highly respected defenders and now the cultured stopper is proving he has more strings to his bow by becoming Latics' very own Reading Champion.<br><br>The Premier League Reading Stars scheme, a partnership between the National Literacy Trust, Arts Council England, Football Foundation and the Premier League, aims to encourage young people to read more often with their families and to make better use of their local libraries. <br><br>In the Wigan Borough, Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust has teamed up with Wigan Athletic to provide 20 children from four local primary schools (Leigh Central Primary School, Leigh St. Joseph's, Britannia Bridge and St. Mary & St. John) with the opportunity to take part in the scheme.<br><br>Arjan De Zeeuw is one of 20 Premier League players chosen to pick their favourite book that forms of a Premier League Reading Stars reading list.  Arjan has chosen the multi-award winning picture book 'The Gruffalo' by popular children's author Julia Donaldson.  <br><br>Arjan said,  "I chose 'The Gruffalo' because it is lots of fun and easily accessible for children.  As a father of four young girls I spend an enormous amount of time reading kids books and this is one of my favourites.  I am delighted to be involved in the Reading Stars scheme.  Reading is so important to a child's development."<br><br>Arjan continues, "Hopefully we can inspire more children to read and they will go away and enjoy reading on their own and with their families.  It's great that we can work together with our local libraries in this way and I hope all of the children involved enjoy all of the activities that are planned for them."<br><br>All 20 children involved will have the chance to meet an author and take part in a series of football based literacy games throughout the initiative.  Wigan Athletic has adopted the Wiend Children's Centre and Leigh Library (managed by Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust) to co-ordinate the scheme.  Both libraries will receive free copies of all titles on the Reading Stars book list.  Each library has arranged a series of activities for the children to get involved in including a trip to a local bookstore and a visit from author Tom Palmer.<br><br>Taryn Pearson, Head of Lifelong Learning and Information for Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust, said, "This is an excellent scheme and we are glad we can build on the success of last year.  It definitely had a positive impact on many of the children involved and we really value the importance of giving children good role models like Arjan.  We have forged strong links with Wigan Athletic over the last two seasons and we will continue to look at ways in which we can use our library services more creatively to encourage more people to enjoy reading."<br><br>Other players selected a wide range of titles, including children's classics like Roald Dahl's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' (the choice of West Ham keeper Robert Green); sports books like cricket legend Shane Warne's autobiography (fellow Australian, Everton midfielder Tim Cahill's pick) and award winning novels like 'The Kite Runner' by Khaled Hosseini (Arsenal's Jens Lehmann).<br><br>Dave Richards, Chairman of the Premier League and the Football Foundation, says, ""With Premier League Reading Stars, we hope to be able to use footballers' favourite book choices as a way of inspiring families to read together.  It gives players the opportunity to act as positive role models and shows that by using the power of football we can successfully change people's attitudes to reading."<br> <br>For more information on the scheme in the Wigan Borough please contact Jean Lamb on 404126.

1000 news 2009-02-18 15:45:54 1 Have you had your say in the National Conversation? The largest ever consultation of housing tenants has begun.<br><br>The National Conversation  the biggest such scheme in England  is offering tenants a unique chance to have their say on what they think of their landlords, the services they offer and the areas of service that are most important to get right.<br><br>The newly formed regulator for social housing, the Tenant Services Authority, is keen to consult across the social housing sector to help develop a single set of standards. <br><br>This means that council tenants as well as those in a housing association can expect the same level of service.   And the biggest local provider, Wigan and Leigh Housing, have warmly welcomed the consultation, and urge their tenants to get involved to help shape the future standards for social housing.<br><br>Marjorie Marsden, tenant board member and deputy chair of WALH said: It is important that people get involved so that they can let the new regulator know what matters to them.  Not all landlords operate under the same conditions and the regulator needs to be aware of what matters to tenants in our borough.<br><br>Marjorie added that there are lots of ways tenants can get involved in the National Conversation.  You can attend events run by us or hold Local Conversations at home with friends and neighbours, she said, Or if you prefer you can also complete a questionnaire on-line by visiting the National Conversation website.<br><br>Agreed standards for landlords to meet will be rolled out towards the end of the year with Arms Length Management Organisations, such as Wigan and Leigh Housing, being included under the new regulatory regime from April of next year.<br><br>The consultation period runs until 11 March.

1001 news 2009-02-18 15:48:47 1 The Shark Lark Money is tight and the credit crunch is really biting.  Its not a good time for many people  job security, the mortgage, those bills  everything is suddenly a little more frightening. <br><br>In vulnerable times there may be more of a temptation to take rash action to try to solve cash flow issues.  The councils trading standards team are particularly concerned that residents dont bite off more than they can chew with a dodgy doorstep deal from a loan shark.<br><br>Promises of quick cash may be tempting, but the advice is to steer clear:  youre likely to get a loan on bad terms and be harassed into paying back quickly or borrowing more.  But there are solutions for people that avoid the dangers of loan sharks and their exorbitant rates of interest. <br><br>Council leader Peter Smith is recommending people look at credit unions.  Cllr Smith says: I am delighted to be supporting the role of credit unions. Never has the need for access to borrowing at reasonable rates been more important. I hope more people will use their services rather than get involved with loan sharks.<br><br>In Wigan Borough, there are two local credit unions.  These are co-operatives who can assist people in difficulties as well as acting as secure banks for their members.  They are fully regulated, open to anyone, have low interest rates for borrowers but in many cases can give savers a return on their cash which rival ISAs and the deals of the mainstream banks.<br><br>The Unify Credit Union is based in Ince and the council-backed Welcome Credit Union based is at the council tax offices in Whelley.<br><br>The councils improvement champion, Cllr Chris Ready, is a supporter of credit unions.  He says: They have always been popular in Ireland and America, whilst weve been a little slower to catch on here in Britain.  But there are thousands of members in Wigan Borough  and that number is increasing in these difficult times.<br><br>Cllr Ready wants to see locals doing their bit to help each other.  He adds: If you can spare an hour or two a week to assist, wed love to hear from you.  As well as the existing groups, were looking to see if we could work at the local level in every ward to support people in these difficult times.<br><br>By saving with a credit union, members build up a credit history and they can then go on to benefit from low cost loans.  Credit unions consider each loan on an individual basis even for those on a low income or with poor credit history.<br><br>Diane Schanzl, who manages Welcome, says: Theres no profit, no investing outside in the troubled world markets.  We are run by the members for the members  your money is safe and kept locally for the benefit of members.<br><br>For further information on Unify you can call 01942 701706, or visit <a href="http://www.unifycu.org" class="textlink" target="_blank">www.unifycu.org</a>; for more information about Welcome you can call 01942 828702 or visit <a href="http://www.welcomecreditunion.co.uk" class="textlink" target="_blank">www.welcomecreditunion.co.uk</a>.<br><br>If you are having problems with loan sharks or need more information, trading standards recommend calling Consumer Direct on 08454 040506 (calls charged at local rate). 0

2005 news 2011-04-12 15:54:03 1 Closing in on the counterfeiters More than 2,000 fake DVDs and computer games have been seized in a joint operation by Wigan Councils Trading Standards and Greater Manchester Police.<br><br>The counterfeiting raid last week followed a lengthy investigation by Trading Standards officers into the illegal sale of fake DVDs and computer games, which are being sold nationwide over the internet.<br><br>Search warrants were executed at 2 residential properties in Atherton and Leigh and more than 2,000 fake discs were recovered from the premises, as well as various computer equipment. Two individuals were arrested.<br><br>The individual running the organised operation had attempted to hide his identity by setting up bank accounts using relatives names as well as using an alias name and false address, says Chief Trading Standards Officer Julie Middlehurst. "But these dishonest measures ultimately provided no protection when pitted against the  impressive investigative skills of Trading Standards.<br><br>From the evidence we obtained, the individual appears to have made in excess of £150,000, whilst at the same time, claiming benefits.  We are committed to working with all partners, and will always share our information with the various benefit agencies to ensure that these individuals are brought to justice.<br><br>"During difficult times, the temptation to buy things under the counter can prove irresistible. But this is not a victimless crime. Selling counterfeits harms the UK economy, undermines legitimate enterprise and affects local jobs. We urge communities to come forward rather than turning a blind eye. Without your help, ridding our neighbourhoods of these illicit goods would be all the more difficult."<br><br>Superintendent Stuart Ellison of Greater Manchester Police's Wigan Division adds: "Police will continue to work closely with Trading Standards to prosecute those who deal in counterfeit goods and I would encourage people to report suspicious activity to us on 0161 872 5050 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."<br><br>You can also ring Consumer Direct on 08454 04 05 06.<br>Investigations are continuing including potential Proceeds of Crime action to recover money made from the activity which can include freezing bank accounts. 0
2006 news 2011-04-13 17:34:33 1 Town Centre Action: Public Has Its Say Council planners are thanking the public for their input into consultation and exhibitions about Wigan town centre.<br> <br>Over 200 people talked to planners at their recent Grand Arcade public events and told officers what they rated and hated about the town.<br> <br>They were seeking views on the Wigan Central Area Action Plan, which looks at what new development is required, where this should be located and how it will be delivered and funded. It will also set out what other improvements and infrastructure works, such as new roads and cycleways are needed to continue the regeneration of the town.   A similar exercise will be undertaken in the future for  proposed Leigh and Ashton Area Action Plans. <br> <br>The town centre contains over 120,000 square metres of retail floorspace and attracts over 300,000 visitors per week.  Its well inside the UKs top 100 retail destinations.<br> <br>Director of economy at the council, Steve Normington, said: We want as many people as possible to get involved in shaping the plan and the future of the town centre. The issues paper is an opportunity for anyone with an<br>interest in the area to let us have their thoughts on what the plan needs to address.<br> <br>The public used post-it notes to declare their pet loves and hates.  They rated both the town's historic buildings and the new modern buildings such as the glass fronted Wigan Life Centre; they also rated the new shops brought to town by the Grand Arcade development.<br> <br>The publics top hates were the derelict appearance of the old town hall and the former police station; and the decline of parts of the Galleries and Marketgate centres; they also hated the lack of leisure and youth facilities within the centre.<br> <br>Many people commented on the need to improve the station frontages, as they offer visitors their first impression of the town  and which the plan is scheduled to look closely at.  And there were a number of comparisons between Wigan and town centres in Warrington and Bolton  both favourably and unfavourably.<br> <br>In response, planners are talking to major landowners and businesses about the future of the town centre.  They still want to hear from the public too about exactly what they want their town centre to be, although many of the issues the public raised are already subject to detailed discussion.<br> <br>The consultation on the Issues Paper runs until 25 May - details are online at <a href="http://www.wigan.gov.uk/wigancentralactionplan" class="textlink" target="_blank">www.wigan.gov.uk/wigancentralactionplan</a><br> <br>Mr Normington adds: Wigan town centre has many strengths. It is an attractive and busy place that has retained the feel of a thriving large market town. The area has a strong community that cares passionately about its future. There are also a series of well established partnerships involving local businesses, the council and others.  Were investing in improvements at the Saddle and on Wallgate and Id like to thank everyone who took time to be involved in this dialogue about the town.<br><br>Work continues on high profile improvements to Wallgate, with £1.2m investment in the street scene, and engineers report that the road layout changes to the Saddle Junction A49 are on programme.  Please see the councils weekly roadworks bulletin for updates. 0
2007 news 2011-04-14 19:58:45 1 Picking - a winner!  Young litter champs team up with football idols Children from schools across Wigan Borough really have played a blinder when it comes to kicking the problem of litter into touch.<br><br>Throughout March, secondary schools teamed up with Wigan Council to rid the borough of rubbish through a campaign aimed at tackling litter on school routes.<br><br>With help from the councils Eco Schools, Cleansing and Neighbourhood teams, pupils took ownership of the areas surrounding their schools.<br><br>They first researched what local people thought about litter and where it was coming from and then took direct action with a planned programme of litter-picks.<br><br>And the results were stunning! Over the month more than 240 pupils collected 280 bags of rubbish from around their schools. The pupils and the council even managed to pull off a late substitution in the shape of stars from Wigan Athletic, who have come out in support of the young peoples efforts.<br><br>A group of 13 young litter-pickers from St John Fisher High School took part in one of the final clean-up events of the month. They first surveyed other pupils in their school to see if they thought litter was a problem and then asked the school caretaker not to pick up any litter for a two-day period.<br><br>During the clean-up that followed the pupils managed to collect a whopping 30 bags full of litter. As a thank-you the team were invited to Wigan Athletics training ground to meet some of the players.<br><br>Wigan Councils Environmental Education Co-ordinator Nick Burdekin, says: We are really pleased with the results of our month-long anti-litter campaign. The children really have risen to the challenge and theyve made a real difference to the streets around their schools. Its often easy to think that young people are the cause of litter problems in our borough but the truth is they are now leading the way in tackling this problem. The campaign month may have finished but were sure that many of those who took part will continue to keep our borough clean.<br><br>Wigan Athletic manager Roberto Martinez added: Everyone knows that you play better when you play as a team and when it comes to clearing litter it looks like Wigan Borough has a great team. Its fantastic to see so many young people getting involved in their local community in this way. We can all learn something from the example being set by the boroughs young people. 0 brian/11lli.jpg Wigan Athletic stars Hugo Rodallega, Franco Di Santo, Ronnie Stam, Steve Gohouri, Conor Sammon, Steven Caldwell and Gary Caldwell with the clean-team from St John Fisher High School and members of the councils Environmental Education, Cleansing and Neighbourhood teams.
2008 news 2011-04-14 20:03:25 1 Rugbys Coming Home?  Borough partnership bids to host World Cup The Rugby League World Cup belongs in Wigan Borough. <br>Thats the message from sports stars, community leaders, the business community and fans of the game as Wigan Borough formally submits its bid to host the 2013 tournament.<br><br>A top-flight team from Wigan Council, Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust, Ashton Leigh and Wigan PCT; Leigh Sports Village; home-town heroes Wigan Warriors and the Leigh Centurions and the boroughs network of amateur clubs has been working hard to bring Leagues most prestigious event to the  games spiritual home.<br><br>The bid has captured the imagination of rugby stars from across the generations from Leigh legend Tommy Sale right through to upcoming Wigan hero Sam Tomkins.<br><br>Giving his support to the bid, former Wigan, England and Great Britain Rugby League star and Sky Sports Commentator Phil Clarke, says: The Rugby League World Cup offers a real opportunity to spread the game of Rugby League across the whole of Greater Manchester and although it has been played for over 100 years in the region, I believe that this event will help raise the profile of the sport and demonstrate the skills and values the game has to offer.<br><br>Wigan Borough faces competition to host the event from Rugby League heartland across the Pennines and from Wrexham in North Wales, as well as bids nearer to home from Warrington, Widnes and St Helens.<br><br>But the borough partnership is confident that the bid from Wigan will be a world-beater. <br>Wigan Council and PCT Chief Executive Joyce Redfearn says: Few places can measure sporting success in the same way that our borough can and for many Rugby League is the lifeblood of our community. Not only are we steeped in the history and culture of the game but our central location, close to the major motorways and two international airports makes Wigan Borough the perfect location for this event. We also have the support of the real grass-roots in the shape of the boroughs many amateur rugby league clubs, which really proves we are a bedrock of the game.<br><br>The partnership shows how effective we are at working together. It really builds on the success we have had in coming together as one team for the borough and it has put together a fantastic bid.<br><br>We wish our rival bidders well but the strength of our bid makes us believe that Wigan Borough will be a World Cup winner!<br><br>Whilst Simon Toon, chief executive of Leigh Sports Village, adds that the borough has the right facilities to make the World Cup one to remember.<br><br>In both halves of the borough we have world-class stadiums for a world-class event. The DW Stadium needs no introduction and Leigh Sports Village has proved its worth by hosting a number of high-profile international sports events and were relishing the change to shine with this fantastic opportunity to show what we can do.<br><br>Wigan Boroughs bid will formally submit the bid before the closing date of Friday April 15. Officials from the Rugby Football League will scrutinise all the entries before reaching a decision. The announcement is likely to be made in the autumn.<br><br>Wigan Warriors star and Super League Young Player of the Year Sam Tomkins, sums up the mood: Come on Wigan Borough! he says.<br><br>Sport is a fantastic way of bringing people together and this event really would be a massive boost to both the boroughs community spirit and the local economy as well. Its going to brilliant to see this event come home and were all backing the bid!<br><br>While Centurions coach Ian Millward adds: What we need now is for rugby fans from all over the borough to get behind us and show their support. The slogan for the 2013 tournament is Belong and we want everyone to say it belongs in Wigan Borough.<br><br>You can pledge your support for Wigan Boroughs bid to host the Rugby League World by leaving a message on Wigan Councils Facebook or Twitter site  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/wigancouncilonline" class="textlink" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/wigancouncilonline</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/wigancouncil" class="textlink" target="_blank">www.twitter.com/wigancouncil</a> 0 brian/11rll.jpg Wigan Boroughs Rugby World Cup Bid team.
2009 news 2011-04-15 08:17:11 2 Burglars attack householder Burglars hit a Worsley Mesnes resident with a plank with nails sticking out of it before targeting a house on the same street. <br><br>At about 2.50am on Friday 8 April 2011, the victim, a 30-year-old man, was woken up by the front door of his house on Home Grove being kicked open. His wife and four children were also at home. <br><br>Two men burst in and the victim went down to confront them. They hit him on his body with a wooden plank that had rusty nails sticking out of it. He suffered bruising to his body. <br><br>The offenders then stole a laptop and left. <br><br>Later that morning, shortly after 4am the pair burst into another house on Home Grove. They searched downstairs and stole a laptop. <br><br>The 44-year-old woman who lived at this house was also woken up and shouted down to the offenders. They made threats her and told her to stay where she was before leaving. <br><br>The pair are white men in their late teens with local accents in dark hooded tops. One is about 5ft 7in tall while his accomplice is of slim build and about 5ft 10in to 6ft tall. <br><br>Detective Constable Alison Wallwork said: "In both cases, victims were left terrified by these violent robbers who were clearly willing to use violence to get their hands on laptops. <br><br>"They were undeterred when faced with a man who confronted them, so it is imperative that we stop this pair before they strike again. <br><br>"It is rare that offences such as this happen, but I would urge anyone who may have heard or witnessed anything that night to get in touch with us." <br><br>A 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and has been bailed pending further police inquiries. <br><br>Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 5308 or call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. 0

They didn't steal anything and left the premises. <br><br>The offender then stole a green BMW 330 parked outside. The car was later recovered after it crashed into a tree and railings on Warrington Road, Ince. <br><br>A man was seen to run from the scene of the collision towards Banner Street. He was described as white, in his mid 20's, about 5ft 8in tall with shaven dark brown hair and wearing a dark tracksuit top. <br><br>PC Kat Allen, of the Wigan Priority Crime Team, said: "As upsetting as this is for the owner, this incident could have been even more serious. <br><br>"The offender crashed the stolen car into a tree so clearly had little control of the vehicle. <br><br>"I now want to hear from anyone who saw a man fitting the description either milling around St Patricks Way or running from Warrington Road. <br><br>"Your call could help put a reckless criminal behind bars." <br><br>Anyone with information is asked to call Wigan Priority Crime Team on 0161 856 7203 or independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. 0

2012 news 2011-04-19 13:29:34 2 Standish Dispersal Order Cuts Antisocial Behaviour by a Quarter A dispersal order that has been in force across Standish town centre for the last six months has been extended due to its success in reducing antisocial behaviour (ASB).<br><br>Between 15 Oct 2010 and 15 April 2011 there were 52 reports of ASB compared to 69 for the same period in 2009/10, a drop of 17 incidents or 25 per cent.<br><br>Because of this reduction, police and Wigan Council have decided to extend the order for another six months until 21 October 2011.<br><br>Six-month orders are also going to be enforced at Scholes Precinct and in the Beech Hill area from Thursday 21 April to combat similar problems there.<br><br>Dispersal orders are designed to discourage groups from congregating and causing a nuisance, and have been used in areas across Wigan borough that have suffered from serious and persistent ASB.<br><br>The Standish dispersal zone was introduced after a spate of public order offences, and covered Smalley St, Pole St, Preston Rd, Collingwood St, Market St, Bramley Court, Somerfields Car Park, School Lane and all land within the perimeter of these streets.<br><br>Police officers and PCSOs were able to tell people congregating in an area to leave it either immediately or by a certain deadline. They could also tell those who didnt live in the area to leave and not return for up to 24 hours.<br><br>In addition, teenagers under 16 who were not under the control of a parent or responsible person over 18 could be taken home or to an alternative place of safety between 9.00pm and 6.00am.<br><br>Inspector Glenn Jones of the Wigan Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) said: To have reduced the number of antisocial behaviour incidents by a quarter is a really good result, and proof that these measures do work.<br><br>"Its important to stress that the dispersal zone was not introduced to target young people or to demonise any specific groups within the community.  Also, we didnt disperse people just for being in a group, as we recognise that not all groups cause a nuisance.  Our main aim is to target anyone who behaves unacceptably, no matter what their age, and it is only by doing this that we can make these areas more pleasant and safer for everyone.<br><br>Joanne Makin, Group Manager for Neighbourhood Teams at Wigan Council, adds: "In some of our neighbourhoods there are small areas that have become no go zones for local residents, who find themselves intimidated by gangs who are congregating and causing a nuisance. This is totally unacceptable.<br><br>This joint action sends out a clear message that agencies will not tolerate harassment in any form. This reduction is another example of how, working together, agencies can achieve significant results.<br><br>To contact the Wigan NPT call 0161 856 7124 or email wigan.apt@gmp.police.uk  <br><br>For non-emergency calls or to report crime call police on 0161 872 5050 or for more information visit gmp.police.uk/wigan    <br><br>Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Moved to Australia in 1980 and have never looked back...although I've been back for weddings and funerals, one of the weddings was my own (see above). Wouldn't swap Australia for anything, not even a meat and potato pie, as it's been very good to me and I would urge any resident Wiganers reading this to apply immediately to emigrate. Hope to retire soon if I can persuade my young and beautiful Wigan wife to move north to Diamond Beach...no, that's not where they shoot "Home and Away"...could go on forever with this .............. Blackcurrant Tarts..no comments please... and, strangely enough, working behind the bar at Sloopies and serving all you Wigan girls.

7 4 2 neverstill 2006-05-06 14:25:41 Re: Tony Blair ive never been into politics before, but at this election i took an interest.....for people like us- meaning working couple with children- i suppose labour has helped loads with the tax credits......but i didnt vote labour.
why? simply because of those tax credits, they made a mistake with ours even after 5 phone calls 3 visits to tax office, they reckoned they hadnt overpaid us by £1,500.....when we knew very well they had. then 7 months later we get a letter stating we have to pay the over payment back! we went to the citizen advice for help....the tax credit system said, it had made mistakes but where scrapping debts if people could prove that they had phoned the tax office about over payments at the time it happened.......i didnt have such proof...so for all of last year we were struggling money wise because we were not getting any extra....this year im not even applying for the credits, i dont trust the system enough! 80.193.190.49 0 0 0

If it is your head "gasket" £250 is expensive, but if it's your cylinder head that's cracked then that's a different tale.  I don't know much about cars, only what I remember when I used to tinker with my Cortina.  It would be worth getting a couple of different quotes though love, just to be on the safe side.  I don't know where you live but the garage that services our vehicles at work is Spring Street garage just off Darlington Street East and they're very good.  If you can get your car there ask to see John and tell him Mollie from Corlett's sent you.  There's nowt wrong with a spot of name dropping.

956 956 1 brian 2006-06-13 23:40:40 Sorry, but it needs to be said Wigan Forums has unfortunately gone the same way that the wiganworld forums went. Belly up.

All thanks to a very small minority who want to spoil it for the rest of us. I'll stop there.

Thanks for your efforts Oy - it was appreciated by lots of Wiganers. You only have to read some of the 'popular' posts on here to see.

What next? 

Well, I now know of 6 (yes, six) Wigan forums. I had a crazy thought too. Perhaps bringing back a [b]new wiganworld forum[/b] where it costs £1 to join. Subscription only, via Paypal. That way, kids can't join, everyone is traceable (name/addy), and the money would go towards hosting with some left over for charity.

Good idea? Maybe - but I don't want the hassle. 80.192.132.107 0 0 3617

1934 1934 1 empress 2006-07-18 20:44:25 Check this parents and grandparents Today I was linked to a site called Bebo.I was told to check if my kids were on it as a lot of kids are on this site and the security aint that .............great.I got a shock on finding my 9 year old daughter registered, I am security conscience, also my parental controls went into overdrive. So I joined this site using a fake ID, fake email adress and fake age. It lists all schools, even infant schools, kids join it and anyone can message or access them. A visitors teenage daughter had put my little girl on despiote the age limit being 13, I didn't have a clue, almost had a cardiac when I saw her full name and school listed. I called this visitor  and told her I was angry, that in my opinion ts a site that could be used to groom kids. Her mum then told me her daughter had been talking to a kid for weeks on there, planning to meet up, this kid was a 34 year old man from Liverpool.Please check your kids aren't on this site, I have contacted a lot of parents from my daughters school today who didn't know their kids were on it, also the NSPCC is aware of it as are the police and the Internet Watch Foundation, but little can be done to close it down, so I guess its up to us parents.If this site is for over 13's why are primary and even infant schools listed?If its a teen site why are there adults on it I checked and found many in their 30's and 40's with  choice pass times on their profiles .I bet our schools aren't aware they are on these lists.If you want to check register on it, use a fake ID like I did, it shows up their poor security for our kids, I have passed this onto a lot of people today some who have found their own kids on there listed as 14 and 18 when they are actually no more than 9 or 10. Its apparently well known in school. 82.33.158.15 0 0 1933

The building is still there but it's a pub or something of the sort now.  Tommy Moss, I believe, also had a dance hall above the Ritz Cinema.

993 Britboy Michigan USA long ago..browsing Interesting to see some of the "Regular users" getting upset about the chat room. Unfortunately the minority usually spoil it for the majority. There are thousands of chat channels in MIRC, ICQ, or chat in Yahoo and Microsoft Messenger. The Wigan chat room cannot be mediated over 24hours a day so its left to the people in chat rooms to act a bit more civilised, but that very seldom happens. 2005-07-02 17:35:38 0

998 britboy Michigan USA browsing long ago Hmmm so users of the Wigan chatroom think its safe!!! The chatroom is wide open to anyone of 6 billion people in the world who own a computer and an internet connection. All chatrooms are safe, but you can't say the same for the people so get real and don't regard ANY chat room as safe! Just approach chatrooms with a high degree of caution and don't be sucked in with the chat crap, make a good choice of the people you want to talk. 2005-08-02 10:54:17 0

3 1 John Burgess Waterford Ireland I remember the man lighting the gas street light just outside our house in Kimberley St. Trying to remember the names of the two cobblers shops who made clogs nearby, one was the very right hand shop in the row of shops on park road at the side of Moss St., the other was on Springfield Rd. just about opposite Mort St. 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00

8 1 Jack Yates Hindley England Sitting at my desk in St Peter's School and hearing the scrape clop, scrape clop,of the miners as they left their bus and went their different ways home. We couldn't see them. The classroom windows were ten feet high, but the sound of the clogs meant it was home time and freedom 'till tomorrow. I remember the sound of my own clogs as we ran up and down the street striking sparks from the clog irons. My mother put a stop to that; she had the irons taken off and rubbers put on. A new set of irons every couple of weeks wasn't funny, but it was expensive. 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00

92 11 susan skelmersdale england i got my first job while i was still at school. it was in the offices of a famous Catalogue company, and i said i had finished school, (although it was in the summer holidays before i went into my last year). i just wanted a job to earn some extra money. the work was ok, but extremely boring, and i remember i got Â£6.00 a week, and i thought i was so rich! it was really hard to give in my notice at the end of the six weeks, and even harder to think of a good excuse why i had to leave! 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00
93 11 veronica westhoughton Bolton Aspinall's wallpaper shop in Mesnes St. I was 15 and for the princely sum of Â£2 12s 6d a week I worked in the shop. I was shown how to trim rolls of wallpaper on a trimming machine and made a pig's ear of the first batch of expensive paper - the customer brought it back and I got into trouble!! It was difficult to keep the sides even and in parts I had trimmed too much pattern off the side! Looking back I should not have been allowed to do that particular job at the age I was. I did not stay long I'm glad to say. 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00

The trouble was, girls had leather on their clogs, the boys had irons and could spark them, I was most frustrated by not being able to do the same.

1005 9 supuplad wigan lancs I remember early St Pats, there was a slaugterhouse near the school and sometimes the animals would escape and get into the playground??!!!!! The Fire Brigade were always at the school cos kids got their heads stuck in the railings! I remember going to Church and singing the Mass in Latin, but i think that was lovely. Miss Veasey and Miss Lenegan lived near our family and if you were misbehaving at home the words " Carry on and i'll take you round to Miss Veaseys" would strike fear in your heart!!! Miss Holland was the Headmistress at St John Fisher when it was an all girls school, she was nasty! We weren't allowed on the bus at the same time as the boys at the school next door! She made us have a different start and finish time so that we couldn't mingle with the boys? I could go on forever about both schools. Father Lappin was a bit of a tyrrant, he used to come to your house on Fri's and he was given food, drink and money?! You couldn't go out to play until he'd been?! 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00

1015 11 Dave Ingram sales@wargamestore.com Bromborough England To Suzanne Hendon
Hi Suzanne, I'd forgotten about Barbara but yes you are right that was her name.  She worked with my dad for most of his time in Wigan.  He was teaching until two days before his untimely death, in 1988, at the age of 63.  He felt unwell after finishing a dancing class and called an ambulance.  What the hospital didn't manage to find in the 36 hours before his death was an Aneurysm which eventually ruptured.  At the time I thought 63 was old but now aged 52 it seems very young indeed!  We buried him in Hindley Cemetery and old Court School colleagues came from all over the country to pay their last respects.  We inscribed the headstone with the title of a song by one of his favourite bands, Roxy Music, titled simply "Dance Away."  Members of his classes in Northwich had a commemorative plaque mounted on a wall in the Polish Club where he had taught after leaving Wigan. 0 2008-05-26 12:11:30

1009 9 Mona Spring Pemberton Wigan UK Stephen since you have been the recipient of Bus sarcasm on a number of occasions I am impressed with your altruistic response. It does you credit. However, I do not feel that I can be so generous. Steven mentions that Bu is red and white through and through, but Blackpool rock has Blackpool through and through but is made in China. Bus stance against educated people probably stems from what he feels, consciously or subconsciously, is his own lack of education. It is similar to the Napoleonic complex where small people try to make themselves bigger in other ways. My advice to Bu, as a school teacher, is to start some educational classes, perhaps basic English, basic Maths and a language, say French. You can then work up from those starting points. Also you are strongly advised to find an Interpersonal Skills course. This will help you to avoid the difficulties you encounter with the other site contributors. I think it unfair to victimise Bu so I will abstain from the vote on whether or not he is a semi skilled Wiganer. But unfortunately, otherwise I must poo poo, Boo Boo. 0 2008-06-11 14:29:29

523 310 Colin http:// It's further down from the Cherry Gardens, not further up. They started to strip the roof off the building to try to evade council tax, but were made to reinstall it. Ha! But, think of the council tax the council would get out of a few 'apartments' (read: flats), maybe they're cutting their own throat here. 2007-09-22 13:38:02 0 80.193.161.89

2069 730 ayrefield http:// happened to drive past earlier, Ian is right - wall plaque on front says 'Ivy Mount'. Anyhow a good photo of the local farmer gerrin is silage in for winter feeding whilst the sun shone, as weather now back to normal. [;(] 2008-10-04 18:24:01 0 86.134.154.250
2070 730 Honk http:// Nice photo Harry in what is a dry field considering all the rain we have had.

2073 730 ayrefield http:// Hello Honk I understand what you are saying but, hay bales are not totally enclosed in polythene, the ends are left open so as to ensure ventilation and thus preventing fermentation.  Silage or haylage bales are totally enclosed in polythene so as to ensure a fermentation, thus providing a natural preservative within the product.  The bales of hay in this photo are being totally enclosed in polythene, that is the reason why I said silage.  But 'hey' I don't want to start an argument. 2008-10-05 13:06:43 0 86.134.154.250
2074 731 Dave http:// 21 Years! That's one helluva Bowls match Ernest! 2008-10-05 17:31:04 0 82.33.173.84
2075 730 Honk http:// Hello ayrefield, please accept my apology, you are correct the bales are indeed totally enclosed and are definitely for silage.  Also, you explanation is spot on.  

Best regards  Honk. 2008-10-05 23:56:42 0 62.30.38.12
2076 730 Harry C. http:// Thanks ayrefield & Honk I didn't   know the difference, I do now, thanks for the info.
H. 2008-10-06 12:58:42 0 62.136.202.118
2077 730 kesh http:// is there a reason that some of the bales are wrapped in blue and some are wrapped in black ? 2008-10-07 09:46:27 0 81.171.195.75
2078 730 ayrefield http:// hello kesh no reason as far as I know, probably the last bit of film on the roll that was used up, unless someone knows different. Never seen blue before as black is usually used in the UK because it absorbs heat a lot better which is needed for the fermentation.

Hello Honk, no need to aplogise marra, at this time of the year you would expect the farmers to be gathering in the last of the hay, but there doesn't seem to have been much in the way of hay making weather this summer at all.
Regards, C. 2008-10-07 20:16:50 0 86.134.154.250

2. F***ing gives proper relaxation for your mind & body.

3. F***ing refreshes you. 

4. After F***ing dont eat too much; go for more liquids.

5. Try to do f***ing in bed cause it can save your valuable energy.

6. F***ing can even reduce your cholesterol level. 


SO, REMEMBER ... 

FASTING is good for your health.[:D][:D]

I thought politics, and religion were now to be avoided on WW. Harry Webb speaks of nothing else. 31.52.252.188 hotwaterpastry I will tell you about socialists and voters and "None so blind"

Aurthur Scargill is still held up as a hero by many.

He is a a money power grabbing parasite. He used the miners for political reasons trying to bring about a UK version of the Russian revolution. While he was doing this of course and the miners were relying on charity to survive he was driving around in his 4.2 ltr xjs or whatever, being paid an enormous salary, had a fantastic pension plan. Had his rent for his 2 houses paid for all out of union funds. He was in court only a few weeks ago because the miners union refused to pay his PARTNERS RENT which he said had been negotiated to be paid for LIFE. [:D][:D][:D]

[b]"But European Commission vice-president Viviane Reding last night insisted Britain could not slap new controls on migrants once restrictions put in place when Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007 are lifted."[/b]

That shows who is running our country and why the tories are hamstrung. 

I suspect that the change in attitude by  the top tories in having an in out referendum that only `12mths ago William Hague said would not be possible is as a direct result of this situation.

What people DONT GET is that this "mass immigration" is for the PRO EUROPEANS an absolute necessity as part of integrating  Europe as a country. THEY want this.

2000 2015-07-29 12:44:11 jasonbourne@hotmail.com How long before WW is run for the good of all members.? Not just the same load mouthed cowards.? Mick Byrne and John Jarvis or real trouble makers yet they or both protected by Brian Elsey and Ron Hunt. Mick Byrne has been banned several times but always gets back on WW to post his same old drivel and post his personal pictures and Videos of people. Jarvis is allowed to carry on his personal attacks and keep up his adulterous affairs. Another individual is Darren Anderton Wilder.He is allowed to post Lies? Time is running out for the integrity the honesty of the people running this Site. It is just a handful of selected posters who abuse all the rules yet members can see the administrators turn a blind eye to Mick Byrne who is the nastiest poster of any forum. John Jarvis runs Message boards and Mick Byrne runs the forum. Members can see who is really in charge of WW and its not Brian Elsey or Ron Hunt. Both or to busy to see what is happening on WW and its been run like this since WW was LOOK. Profit before honesty every time. We will be keeping a close eye on the way this site is run and on Mick Byrne and John Jarvis and others including administration. All post that or deemed offencive will be reported to the proper authorities. 46.101.35.80 jarvo As everyone can see, Jazzy has been around a long time on here (in other guises, of course). It's not hard to see that this poster is an old multi.

As for abuse and nastiness, the poster, he or she, cannot distinguish the difference between comment, opinion and personal abuse.

I have never abused any poster on here.

This thread is to remind people how bad Mac was and is.

2002 2015-07-30 00:57:05 Theclan6@btinternet.com i am the carer for my very disabled daughter. jarvo is continually making comments about me posting on here and where do I get the time. this is in practically ever post he writes, together with his deliberate mis-spelling of my name, changing it to a very offensive word, which is slang for ejeculate. please delete his post, its very abusive. 86.142.243.175 jarvo It's easy to spot the multis. Eront, Gemmers (she once had 28 different guises) and the prolific Jizzy.

It was the 'I'm leaving...goodbye then' that was a dead giveaway. And the constant posting dawn till dusk. Most carers wouldn't have time for it, but there you go.

And then you have the mysterious Stoo the Poo, the guy with half of Wiggin on his shoulders, that's if he has any; the vitriolic invisible man.

To cap it all, the fellah who tours the pubs of Wiggin for a bet...Hic. [:l]

Granada appears: a breath of fresh and a lovely fellah to boot. You see, that's the difference: guys like me and him exist...

2003 2015-07-30 20:43:05 Theclan6@btinternet.com jarvo has again referred to me as Jizzy. I would appreciate it if you could remove his post, as Jizzy is slang for ejeculate, and since this is twice in less than 24 hours hes done this, could you please tell him to stop referring to me in this offensive manner. 86.142.243.175 jarvo Jizzy: Saying that you don't give a ...., you spend a lot of time on my threads...[?]

Anyway: Next clue:

Fish are actually a link...Plural, that is.

my husband - he is blind and I am disabled. I was born in Platt Bridge. I went to St. Nats. until my parents took me away because I was having such a bad time. They paid for me to go to the High School. That stopped after the 1944 education Act came into force. I trained as a teacher and lived in London until I married when we came to the West country. We have now lived in bath for longer than we lived anywhere else, but my roots are in Wigan. My grandfather was one of the rescuers in the Maypole disaster.

2185 rachelcitadel@hotmail.co.uk pacaminos 3 2011-06-11 2011-06-11 The Smiths LTD The Smiths Ltd was formed in February 2009 by Smiths obsessed Alex Gaskell (guitar), Andy Crook (Bass) and Keith Partington (drums). 
We realised that we needed a superb front man and started an extensive 4-month search to find the perfect Morrissey. After a piece in the Manchester Evening News and a Channel M and Rock Radio interview, Johnny Turner heard our plea and came to audition. As obsessive as we were about getting the sound right and bearing an uncanny vocal and physical resemblance to Morrissey, Johnny completed The Smiths Ltd line-up in June 2009.
After 5 months of rehearsals we played our first gig in October 2009 to a rapturous audience and we havent looked back since.

Being the ONLY Smiths tribute band from and based in Manchester, UK we also have a unique selling point and an authenticity that is hard to beat. The band also uses the same guitars, bass, amps and drum kit live that the Smiths used on their very last tour.

94 P. Cook pjc3219@cs.com According to my great-grandmother's death certificate, it states that she was born in Wigan on August 24, 1868.

She traveled with the Harmston circus as an apprentise, and later with her husband and troupe in many circuses around the world.

95 Nancy Spencer Jones nancyjblue@cs.com Albert Spencer, my Grandfather was born in Feb. 1876 to Martha Spencer, age 27, unmarried. They either lived with, or near, Robert and Elizabeth Harrison and their family for many years on Swan Lane Hindley. Martha being listed as sister-in-law in 1971 census. Martha and Elizabeth Spencer were born in Ormskirk. Martha worked as a silk winder and in 1886 married Joseph William Sargeant, a coal miner. She died in 1902.
Albert was a coal miner from a very young age.
I want to find who my grandfather's father was. His name is not on my grandfather's birth record or on his marriage record, to Elizbeth Jackson of Bolton in 1905.
I hope to find someone from the Harrison or Spencer family who may remember hearing this story, as it must have been quite a scandal at that time.
The Harrison Children were Ellen, William, Martha, Robert, Ruth, and Henrietta, most born in Westhoughton.

1019 A M Cunningham Dear Heather Webster,
If your family lived in Miry Lane in the late 19th century the nearest Catholic Church was St Joseph's in Caroline Street which opened in about 1870.  Your great great aunt would probably have been baptised there.  St Jude's RC Church in Wigan has a website which gives interesting information on St Joseph's which is now closed but still standing, albeit in a bad state.

ROLFE - CROOKS(nee Grimes)
Hi everyone - any info greatly appreciated please of family/descendants/earlier ancestors.
My GGF William Rolfe married Jane Knowles at St Thomas Church, Ashton in Makerfield on 23/12/1855 and lived at Smithy Brow. William died 1907 and Jane died 1899 both in Oldham. The families were enormous in numerical terms! Children I know of were:-
Jane Anne Rolfe b.1856 married George Silvester 1878 
Alice Rolfe b.1858, 
Thomas Rolfe b.1860, 
Louisa Rolfe b.1864 married Henry Stubbins
Fanny Rolfe b.1879 married Richard Phoenix.
James Henry Rolfe b.1873 married Mary Hutton
William Rolfe b.1888, and there were many others.
My GF William Rolfe b.1864 Ashton in Makerfield married Annie Crooks (nee Grimes)
in 1896 and similarly they had a truck load of kids - more than 20 in all! Some of their names are Mary Rolfe b.1897, Alice b.1898, Thomas b.1901, Harry b.1904, Frank b.1906 Leo b.1909, Annie b.1912.

4 6 charlie pemberton how ridiculous to spend all that money on more shops when we can't fill the ones in the gallerys! go to index and have a look around. why don't they build a new concert hall? a town the size of wigan with no concert hall. why? 0
5 6 Ron Wigan They don't need to build a concert hall we have one! The Ritz. Forget all about the 'Grand Arcade' fiasco and refurbish this great building. In it's time one of the biggest cinemas in England. I think it would hold around 2,000 people. I don't know how much of the original interior is left? However I am sure it could be rebuilt to it's former glory. What a great asset to the town. Instead of yet another White Elephant!!!! What nobody in Wigan wants. Except the council. Who are elected to represent OUR views Not their own. As I have already said somewhere else on the site. "Show me a new development, and I'll show you a few backhanders". 0
3 6 John Williams Wigan THIS MONEY COULD BE BETTER SPENT IN FORMER PIT VILLAGES LIKE BICKERSHAW, ABRAM AND OTHER LOCAL PLACES.THE MONEY COULD ALSO BE SPENT ON GETTING KIDS OFF THE STREETS 0
6 6 Rob Wigan It's a good idea, it will improve the area immensely as it is very run down at the moment, it will also attract bigger name shops such as HMV, Waterstones, Gap etc. so Wiganers don't have to go to Manchester or Liverpool all the time. 0
7 6 Carl Ince HMV, Gap, Waterstones? Have any of these agreed to come to Wigan? I doubt it very much. So far it seems that only existing busineses have signed up to new units like debenhams, M&S, Next... What will happen to their premises when they move? Hmm... VACANT. 0
8 6 len wigan open ur eyes and look around. why do the council and the goverment give grants and hand outs to build new buildings.there are so many dis used shops and buildings in wigan already. spend the money to renovate these buildings to there former gloury??? as u walk down the familier street look up at the arcitecture . demolish these buildings and u may never see them again . only quickly build fabricated block buildings . that to in time will stand empty !!!! 0
9 6 james robert ashton another white elephant for wigan town center, when will the council realise that wigan is no longer a single town but a borough that includes many smaller towns and villages and spend some money on their infastructure.We all pay the rates in what ever guise it takes, spread the money round a bit more evenly PLEASE. Any way you can't get into wigan town center as it is. 0
10 6 Barbara Johnson Seattle USA I left Wigan in 1985 and after going all through your website there does`nt seem to be any of the old wonderful Wigan left, I could weep when I see how many old buildings have gone. Great website. 0
11 6 Tim Cooke Wigan I agree with the majority. Keep the Ritz ! I work for the council, and I'm sick of them making rash and stupid decisions, that cost US the tax payer thousands of pounds. There is no variety in Wigan, if you want to see a show, you have to travel to Bolton, Preston, St.Helens, Bury, Manchester Etc. All the surrounding towns all have decent theatres, sometimes two. Get a life Wigan Councillors. Stop ripping the heart out of OUR town. Give us some variety. Not more shops, not more take-aways, not more pubs or nite clubs. But a decent Live venue. KEEP THE RITZ !!! 0
12 6 jim edwards bryn having worked on the galleries and seen all the empty shops, whats the point in building more shops, if the rental of these units where more reasonable perhaps there would not be as many empty. 0
93 5 John Cottom Wigan The Wigan Observer is the only local paper worth reading,lets hope it never follows the same line as the evening post. 0
94 5 Orter Wigan The reporter is decent paper, its free,its delivered free, OK it has plenty car ads. Have a good look at the dailys,they have plenty ads and they aren,t free. Must admit, I,ve had plenty of smiles reading the spelling of the classified ads. You would think they would employ someone on the end of ads phone who can spell. No don,t bother,I get the drift of the ads and I also get a smile! it,s free because the advertisments cover the cost and there,s probally a few Quid left. Nobody gives you something for nothing,you don,t have to read the ads, just enjoy, and when you,ve finished reading it, cut into 6inch square pieces, stick on a nail in your loo, presto! Free bog rolls! No sruggling to find the the first sheet of tissue when your in a hurry. 0
95 5 kathryn wigan Wigan reporter,what's that? Although we live in wigan we do not receive one, if we did I would only too happy to comment on it! 0
96 5 Bert WIGAN POST IS PRINTED IN PRESTON AND DOESNT IT SHOW.LATICS WOULD HAVE TO WIN EUROPEAN CUP TO GET DECENT COVERAGE EVERY DAY! 0
97 5 Mark Ploon wigan the reporter is not free. It costs £1000 a page to advertise in it but the ten year olds who lug them around in the rain are paid just 2 pence a paper 0
98 5 Jeff wigan They charge 5p to put one leaflet in that paper and on average theres about 8 of them in every paper. Theat's 40 pence for spam. They just make too much money and don't care how they make it. 0
99 5 Lyndsey Wigan the standard of writing in all the wigan papers is very poor. It's boring as well. I get the impression most of 'em don't even live in Wigan. 0
100 5 LoRa! wigan no deffenatley not too much rugby in these papers, we need a good sport to follow in our home town, and why not let it be rugby! i think you should put more rugby in, and please they should not put asmeny spelling mistakes in like simple words like danny tickle (they spelt it like danny pickle) i mean come on....the top man for the warriors! 0
101 5 Ed! wigan When I put an ad in Reporter I just got a load o these weirdos askin' if I'd like double glazin' and one neet some comany rang me ten times askin' if I'd like a bit of a timeshare. I'm not puttin' an advert in there again! 0
102 4 eddie wigan (winstanley) forget it wigan council, its not happening! This area should be turned into a place of beauty, a nature reserve or something. 0
513 8 Joe Grimes Atherton Hello,
Just read Mr Mellings note.
It's a sad day for all when someone with Alan's specialist local knowledge packs in and a sure sign of the way he is being treated. If anyone was ever in the right job he was and much appreciated by us locals, god help who comes next!
I despair,
Joe 0
508 6 Matthew Stott local paper boy Higher Ince I think that the money could have been better spent as a few of the others have covered. There is only about 5 shops we never used to have and i think its a bit of a disapointment because all the hype and build up has been let down for me and a few others. 0
509 7 Matt stott Higher Ince Why dont we lower bus prices then people may actually travel more on buses, instead of ranting and raving about bus lanes and cycle lanes. We moan also about the global warming and pollution, this is the main cause. Why dont more people take the bus and we lower bus fairs. Theres enough busses around. Ince bar to wigan are once every 2 mins

i no im going off topic here but still. 0
511 8 Bill Melling Leigh I have just heard that Alan Davies, the archivist at Leigh Town Hall, has handed in his resignation and will be leaving in about three weeks time. 0
512 8 Jonathan Parton Lancaster Seeing the news from your last correspondent saddens me. I was a regular user of the archives a couple of years ago and remember Mr Davies's enthusiastic help given to me, but also his frustration trying to run the archive single handedly. To expect him to do the same over two days a week is nothing short of constructive dismissal, no-one would stand for that sort of treatment.
What low calibre managers the department must have to create these situations. More importantly who is likely to take on such a post in the future! 0
516 8 Andy Lomax Kitt Green Dear Mr WW,
Amanda (above)may be pleasantly surprised in actually getting some half decent service at the History Shop but she comes from one angle, that of the fanatical family tree brigade who make excessive demands of staff at the best of times.
The heritage department should be much wider in it's scope and services than giving priority to people carrying out the pointless excercise of creating family trees, which their children eventually throw in the bin!
Keep up the good work Mr WW,
Andy 0
518 8 Jim of Hindley Hindley not Wigan! Too right what Andy says, I went to the History Shop recently to quietly read local history books and was surrounded by sad eccentric people wondering who else was in their grandad's grave and how to find out!
Get a life I say,
Jim (75) 0
519 7 biker ashton Bike lanes are useless when you have to pull out every five yards because of parked cars. There is usually room to park cars on the outside of cycle lanes, as I have seen in other town around the UK. 0
520 6 jamie wigan i think it is brill it should of been done a few years ago 0
521 6 Stephen Cambridge I was brought up in Wigan and visited last weekend. How appalling to see the ghost of the Wigan Casino and the Ritz covered over with the usual boring chain  shops. Sure it looks nice but what was wrong with the old JJBs, Debenhams etc. Now the galleries and what we used to call the precinct are dead. Poor old Smiths will have to put up a fight to attract people to what will become the rough end of town. Madness, really, when what Wigan needed was a decent music venue, maybe gasp even a gallery or "summat proper nice" as you folks might say. 0
