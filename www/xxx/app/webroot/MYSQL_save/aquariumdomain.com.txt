1 Beginner Hobbyist Guide:  Beginners guide to keeping Neon Tetra This freshwater aquarium hobbyist guide looks at keeping Neon Tetra in the home aquarium from the standpoint of a beginning aquarium hobbyist.  The guide covers the basics to successfully select and care for Neon Tetra within the freshwater community aquarium environment. <b>Where do Neons come from...</b>
<p>
Neon Tetras are native to the streams and small tributaries of the Amazon including areas of southeastern Colombia, northeast Peru and northern and western parts of Brazil.  They thrive in blackwater and murky water areas of dense vegetation, including flood plains during the rainy season.  Neon Tetras in the wild are found in large schools staying close to the lower areas of the streams and creeks in which they live, close to vegetation and root structures that afford them protection from larger predatory fish species.  While it isnï¿½t necessary to completely recreate their natural environment in the home aquarium, it is important to provide some key aspects of it.  If you plan to keep Neon Tetras in your community freshwater aquarium, you should plan to provide areas of lower lighting with either vegetation or root structure to provide them a reasonable comfort level with their environment and a place to escape larger more aggressive species. <b>Choosing healthy specimens and selecting proper quantities...</b>
<p>
When selecting Neon Tetras for your aquarium it is important to choose healthy specimens that will be able to cope well with the transition into their new aquarium environment.  Specimens should be active swimmers that swim purposely in the aquarium and do not float or drift in the water as this is a sign of poor health.  Healthy specimens will also exhibit bright well defined colors that are not washed out or faded in appearance.  General fish selection rules apply as well, in that the store aquarium should be clean, free of any odors and dead fish.  Since the Neon Tetra is a very small fish it is a little more suseptible to fluctuations in water chemistry, so it is important to acclimate them slowely to their new environment. 
<p>
In addition, Neon Tetra are a schooling fish and should absolutely be kept in reasonable sized schools in order for them to thrive in the home aquarium.  The size of the school will vary depending on aquarium size, but at least a group of 8 or more specimens should be doable in most all but the smallest aquariums.  Larger schools tend to do even better as the numbers provide the Neon Tetra with a good comfort zone and feeling of safety.  It is not uncommon to see schools of Neon Tetra as large as 20 to 30 fish in even moderately sized aquariums because of their relatively small size.  Last but certainly not least is the sheer beauty of a large school of Neon Tetra with their vibrant color and closely grouped schools, they provide a truly impressive site within the community freshwater aquarium. Overall the Neon Tetra is a hardy small fish species that brings a lot of color and activity to peaceful freshwater community aquariums.  With a reasonable amount of care, a beginner aquarium hobbyist can not only maintain this species, but create an environment in which they can thrive. freshwater-community-fish Hobbyist-Guide Administrator :: AquariumDomain.com 2009-07-22 2009-08-07 00:28:50 1 Not yet rated English Neon Tetras /images/fish_freshwater/tetra_neon1.jpg Neon Tetra Closeup /images/fish_freshwater/tetra_neon2.jpg School of Neon Tetras /images/fish_freshwater/tetra_neon3.jpg Tetras schooling /images/fish_freshwater/tetra_neon5.jpg Neon Tetra Closeup /images/fish_freshwater/tetra_neon6.jpg Large group of Neons /images/fish_freshwater/tetra_neon7.jpg Another Closeup /images/fish_freshwater/tetra_neon8.jpg Pair of Neons /images/fish_freshwater/tetra_neon9.jpg Beginner aquarium hobbyist guide for the Neon Tetra, community freshwater fish species. <b>In the aquarium...</b>
<p>
Neon Tetras are suitable for the beginning aquarium hobbyist, but they do require that the aquarium environment support their basic needs.  In the wild, Neon Tetra generally live in water that is cooler as it is well shaded from the sun and somewhat on the acidic side, ranging from a pH of 5.0 to 7.0 and KH or 1.0 to 2.0.  However, within the aquarium environment they can be acclimated to tolerate brighter lighting conditions and pH as high as 7.5 if they are brought into these conditions gradually as not to shock the fish.  This is best accomplished by emptying the newly bought Neon Tetra into a container with the store bag water and the fish.  Then, every 5 minutes a cup full of water can be added to the container for 20 to 30 minutes.  This will give the fish time to adjust to both the water chemistry and temperature of the aquarium system.  After this acclimation process is complete the fish should be netted and added to the aquarium and the water in the acclimating container should be discarded.
<p>
Once in the aquarium, Neon Tetra should be provided plenty of places to hide if threatened; such as, live or fake plants, drift wood or root structures or large rocks.  Due to their size and overall very passive nature, Neon Tetra should only be kept with other peaceful community species that will not grow large enough to eat them.  While they reach just over an inch in size when fully grown, they do form tight schools that help give them protection from other larger fish species, so it is strongly recommended that this species be kept in good sized groups which will benefit their overall health and security. <b>Sexing and Breeding...</b>
<p>
Female and Male Neon Tetras have very subtle physical differences with the female having a more round body and curvature of the blue line, while the male is more slender and has a straight blue line.  The curvature of the blue line in the female is most likely due to the location of the egg sack that even when empty creates a slightly more rounded appearance to the body.
<p>
Typically Neon Tetras are bred in conditions that closely mimic their natural surroundings including dim lighting and cooler water temperatures of around 72 to 75 degrees fahrenheit or 24 degrees celsius.  The breeding aquarium should also have live plants that provide areas of the aquarium with high levels of shade and provide the fish a location to deposit their eggs.  Breeders will often try to induce mating by lowering the KH to 1.0 or by letting nitrate levels rise and then replace 50% of the water with fresh RO/DI water along with brighter lighting to simulate the rainy season.
<p>
Once the eggs have been laid it is important to remove the adults as they will often eat young fry.  The young are sensitive to higher lighting levels, so the lights should be maintained a low level and other water parameters should remain stable and constant.  Eggs typically hatch within 24 hours and fry will reach their adult coloration within 30 days.  During this time they can be fed a diet of rotifers, egg yolk, baby brine shrimp or other prepared foods formulated for newly hatched fish. http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=10
2 Beginner The Nitrogen Cycle and New Tank Syndrome The nitrogen cycle as it pertains to the home aquarium is the process of establishing beneficial bacteria in order to break down nitrogenous waste compounds into less harmful nitrates that can be removed from the aquarium via plants or water changes. <b>What Is the Nitrogen Cycle?</b><br>
Like all living creatures, fish give off waste products, these nitrogenous waste products break down into ammonia (NH3), which is highly toxic to both fish & Invertebrates.  In nature, the volume of water per fish is extremely high and waste products become diluted to low concentrations and are ultimately purified by the mass amounts of nitrofying bacteria that exist. In aquariums, however, it can take as little as a few hours for ammonia concentrations to reach toxic levels.  How much ammonia is too much? The quick answer is: if a test kit is able to measure it, you've got too much, it's in a high enough concentrations to stress fish and cause irritation. Consider emergency action such as water changes using Reverse Osmosed water or ammonia locking products, if your ammonia levels are .25ppm or higher.
<p>
The Nitrogen Cycle is the biological process that converts ammonia into other, relatively harmless nitrogen compounds. Fortunately, several species of bacteria do this conversion for us. Some species convert ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (N02-), while others convert nitrite to nitrate (NO3-). Thus, cycling the tank refers to the process of establishing bacterial colonies in the filter bed that convert ammonia -> nitrite -> nitrate.  Nitrate is only toxic at high levels that take time to accumulate and can be removed through partial water changes or aquatic plant life. The desired species of nitrifying bacteria are present everywhere (e.g., in the air), therefore, once you have an ammonia source in your tank, its only a matter of time before the desired bacteria establish a colony in your filter bed. The most common way to do this is to seed your new aquarium using water or substrate from and existing aquarium, live rock or to place one or two (emphasis on one or two) hardy and inexpensive fish in your aquarium (damselfish and chromis are good for this purpose). The fish waste contains the ammonia on which the bacteria will live and grow, be careful not to overfeed them, causing more ammonia than can be handled by the growing bacteria bed.
 <p>
During the cycling process, ammonia levels will vary wildly as the nitrite-forming bacteria take hold. Because nitrate-forming bacteria don't even begin to appear until nitrite is present in significant quantities, nitrite levels skyrocket (as the built-up ammonia is converted), continuing to rise as the continually-produced ammonia is converted to nitrite. Once the nitrate-forming bacteria take hold, nitrite levels fall, nitrate levels rise, and the tank is fully cycled. More recently, products containing colonies of nitrifying bacteria have become available at pet shops (e.g. Fritz, Bio-zyme, Cycle). In theory, adding the bacteria jump-starts the colonization process as above. Net experience with such products has been mixed; some folks report success, while others report they don't work as well as advertised.  In principle, such products should work well. However, nitrifying bacteria cannot live indefinitely without oxygen and food. Thus, the effectiveness of a product depends on its freshness and can be adversely effected by poor handling (e.g. overheating). Unfortunately, these products dont come with a freshness date, so there is no way to know how old they are. 
<p>
Of course, there are many variations on the above that work. However, it is a bit difficult to give an exact recipe that is guaranteed to work. It is advisable to take a conservative approach and not add fish too quickly. In addition, testing the water to be sure nitrates are being produced eliminates the guesswork of determining when your tank has cycled.  Remember that using any method to cycle your 
tank is going to take some time and that following the advice written here along with some patience and diligent water testing, will in the end result in a well established and enjoyable marine aquarium. filtration-general filtration-saltwater filtration-freshwater Article Administrator :: AquariumDomain.com 2009-02-11 2011-12-19 23:06:44 1 English /images/nitrogenCycle.jpg The Nitrogen Cycle /images/nitrogenCycle.gif This article explains the nitrogen cycle process and why it is an important process in the maturation of an aquarium environment. Your tank is fully cycled once nitrates are being produced (and ammonia and nitrite levels are zero). To determine when the cycle has completed, you will need to have a marine water test kit, and measure the levels weekly at first and then monthly.  Another possibility is to bring water samples to your local fish store and let them perform the test for you. The cycling process normally takes anywhere from 2-6 weeks, at temperatures below 70F it takes even longer to cycle a tank.  In comparison to other types of bacteria, nitrifying bacteria grow slowly. Under optimal conditions; however, it can take only 15 hours for a colony to double in size!  It is possible to speed up the cycling process by using bacteria based products available that will speed the process of building the nitrifying bacteria beds.  The use of these products along with proper temperature, water flow and lighting can shorten the cycling process to 1-3 weeks.  Reverse Osmose water should be used to limit the amount of ammonia, nitrite and silicates that are present in the water. 
<p>
<b>Warning: AVOID THE TEMPTATION TO GET MORE FISH UNTIL AFTER YOUR TANK HAS FULLY CYCLED!</b> More fish means more ammonia production, increasing the stress on all fish and the likelihood of fish deaths. Once ammonia levels reach highly stressful or toxic levels, your tank has succumbed to New Tank Syndrome; the tank has not yet fully cycled, and the accumulating ammonia has concentrations lethal to your fish.  Each time you add a couple of fish you will need to allow a couple of weeks for the bacteria in your aquarium filter bed to grow in number to handle the increased amount of ammonia and filtering loads.  Keep in mind that not only are you adding more fish, but you are also increasing the amount of food fed, consumed and the amount of uneated food, all of which creates higher ammonia levels. <b>How Much Ammonia Is Too Much?</b><br>
In an established tank ammonia levels should always be 0 ppm, which is undetectable using standard test kits available at stores. The presence of detectable levels indicates that your bio filter is not working adequately, either because your tank has not yet been completely cycled, or the filter is not functioning adequately (e.g. too small for fish load, clogged, etc.) It is imperative that you address the cause of the problem (filter) in addition to the symptoms (high ammonia levels). 
<p>
The exact concentration at which ammonia becomes toxic to fish varies among species; some are more tolerant than others. In addition, other factors like water temperature and chemistry play a significant role. For example, ammonia (NH3) continually changes to ammonium (NH4+) and vice versa, with the relative concentrations of each depending on the water's temperature and pH. Ammonia is extremely toxic; ammonium is relatively harmless. At higher temperatures and pH, more of the nitrogen is in the toxic ammonia form than at lower pH. 
<p>
<b>Speeding Up Cycling Time</b><br>
The nitrogen cycle can be sped up or jump started in a number of ways. Unfortunately, they require access to an established tank, which a beginning aquarist may not have available. The basic idea is to find an established tank, take some of the bacteria out of it and place them in the new tank.  Most filters have some sort of foam block or floss insert on which nitrifying bacteria attach. Borrowing all or part of such an insert and placing it in the new tanks filter gets things going more quickly.   If the established tank uses an undergravel filter, nitrifying bacteria will be attached to the gravel. Take some of the gravel (a cup or more) and hang it in a mesh bag in your filter (if you can), or lay it over the top of the gravel in the new tank (if it has an UGF). http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?t=11
3 Intermediate Hobbyist Guide: Introduction to Acropora Corals in the Home Reef Aquarium Introduction to Acropora Corals gives marine reef aquarium hobbyists an overview of Acropora Corals especially as it relates to keeping them in the home aquarium environment.
<p> <b>Introduction</b>...<br> 
Acropora corals are highly adaptive, opportunistic and fast growing, which has made them a very popular species in reef aquarium hobby. Acropora can be found in a variety of grow forms ranging from plates to staghorns and a variety of colors. With the popularity and variety of this coral an entire website could be dedicated to their selection and husbandry. However, this guide will introduce the various varieties of Acropora and will cover their scientific background and information related to Acropora within the context of the reef aquarium hobby environment. 
<p> <b>Scientific Information</b>...<br>
Genus Acropora (ak-roh-pohr-ah) is part of the largest family and most important contributor to coral reef formations in the world. The two primary genera Acropora and Montipora together account for almost one-third of all hermatypic or reef-building coral species. While found in both the pacific and atlantic oceans, Acropora is far more dominantly found in the Pacific ocean as there are only 3 known species of Acropora in the Atlantic. Acropora contain specialized axial corallite, which do not contain zooxanthellae, but allow for a very rapid growth rate, as they are fed by other areas of the colony. This allows for the genus to have a advantage over other corals in that they can outgrow them and rapidly colonize the reef. These fast growing Acropora branches can be identified by their light-colored tips, which are almost white or brightly hued.
<p> Acropora need to be acclimated carefully to their new surroundings so that they are not shocked by light, water parameter changes or other stresses. They should also be located in their final position as quickly as possibly to avoid stress or unfulfilled metabolic needs. Typical stressors include: low light, low water current and frequent movement from different positions in the aquarium. They do not tolerate sudden changes in aquarium conditions, especially water temperature and will fade in color, recede in growth or even die if proper water conditions are not maintained. While frag or captive-bred species do best, they often require about 6 months to regain full normal growth rates. Acropora are also susceptible to most known coral diseases including: white-band disease, black-band disease, recession, etc. While Acropora are a demanding species to keep in captivity, it is possible to keep them successfully and can be an extremely rewarding coral to keep and raise. Hopefully the information in this article along with the experience obtained from keeping corals in the reef aquarium will help increase the likelyhood that these corals can not only be kept successfully in the reef aquarium, but also thrive as well. saltwater-corals Hobbyist-Guide AquariumDomain :: Administrator 2009-02-13 2009-08-07 01:02:12 1 English /images/corals/article3_acropora1.jpg /images/corals/article3_acropora2.jpg /images/corals/article3_acropora3.jpg /images/corals/article3_acropora4.jpg /images/corals/article3_acropora5.jpg /images/corals/article3_acropora6.jpg /images/corals/article3_acropora7.jpg /images/corals/article3_acropora8.jpg This Hobbyist Guides covers the basic scientific information related to Acropora coral species and then goes into intermediate detail about keeping Acropora Coral species in the home reef aquarium. <b>About Acropora Corals</b>...<br> 
There are 13 to 15 basic growth forms of Acropora that vary according to size and shape of the branches, the position of the brances, the number of corallite septa and the nature of the coenosteum. The most commonly available aquarium species tend to fall into the following growth forms: branching, bushy, cluster, finger, bottlebrush and tabular. In the aquarium hobby , species are generally sold by form and color as oppossed to the species i.e. purple staghorn or pink bottlebrush. This is understandable, but can make it difficult in providing a species designation, which is then left upto the aquarist. 
<p>
Acropora are highly diverse and adaptable, which makes figuring out the best aquarium conditions difficult. Specimens have been collected in a multitude of areas including areas of strong water current and intense lighting to deep water areas and calm lagoons. Pretty much anywhere coral reefs can be found, Acropora can also be found there thriving. Discussed in the next section, growth forms and not species are probably the better indicator of the natural location of the coral. Coloration of Acropora is even more diverse than the growth forms, with almost every hue of the rainbow possible. <b>Acropora Corals in the Home Reef Aquarium</b>...<br> 
Acropora in the wild are highly adaptable and can exist in a variety of locations including: calm lagoons, pounding reef crests and even reef flats where they can be out of water for periods of time. They tolerate huge differences in light intensity, water movement and even salinity, thus one would think that they would extremely easy to keep in the reef aquarium, but nothing could be further from the truth. In fact they are very demanding of their conditions when housed in captivity. However, once they are acclimated to aquarium life, and if kept with stable water conditions, they will also thrive in the reef aquarium. 
<p>
Generally speaking, Acropora species with thick branches are normally more difficult to keep than those with thin branches. This is most likely because of the inability of reef aquarists to provide enough water flow that the thick branched species need to thrive, thus making these species more prone initially to problems. Brown specimens, bottlebrush and thin branched species tend to be more tolerant of the lower water flow and light level conditions. Tabletop species are among the most difficult Acropora species to keep in the home reef aquarium, with staghorn specimens being somewhere in the middle. 
<p>
Captive-bred or frag specimens seem to be generally healthier and easier to care for than wild specimens. Nonetheless, all Acropora specimens seem to prefer strong, random or mixing type water current with intense lighting and high levels of calcium and strontium to promote maximum growth and health. Water quality should also be excellent and very stable, thus Acropora do much better in established reef aquariums where water parameters are generally more stable. http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?t=12
4 Beginner Hobbyist Guide: Acclimating Corals to the marine reef aquarium This Hobbyist Guide focuses on the steps a hobbyist should take to safely add a marine coral to their reef aquarium.  The recommended steps are clearly laid out, so that a hobbyist of any level will benefit from this guide.  Notes and warnings are included for areas that require special attention or are common areas where new hobbyists typically make mistakes. The vast majority of aquarium hobbyists strive to provide the best possible environment and care for all of their aquariums inhabitants.  It is because of this attention to excellent husbandry, that collectively as a hobby, reef aquarists have learned the best methods in which to introduce and maintain corals within the aquarium environment.  There is probably no more critical time for a coral than during the process of being transported home and introduced into the hobbyists reef aquarium.  During this period of time the coral will be subjected to many stresses, that while inevitable, can be greatly reduced through the care and technique that the marine aquarium hobbyist uses to introduce the new coral into its new home. <p>
In order to safely acclimate Corals into an already established aquarium it is important to closely follow this proven set of procedures designed to limit any stress on the new specimen and get it acclimated as quickly as possible.  It is highly recommended to look over all the steps ahead of time and be sure to have all the necesarry items handy and ready to go prior to the arrival of the new coral specimen.  This acclimation procedure is a safe and easy way to introduce Corals from the relatively stressful water chemistry of its shipping bag to the healthy and safe conditions of its new home. Though it may seem like the best course of action is to get your new specimen into your clean aquarium as soon as possible, it is extremely important to note that rapid changes in water conditions or chemistry can be more dangerous to an aquatic animal than being kept longer in an unhealthy environment. It is this slow transition from shipping container to established tank that is the focus of this acclimation procedure. 
<p>
<b>Note:</b>  It is generally recommended that all newly purchased specimens be quarantined in a separate tank before introduction to the population of your established aquarium; however, the acclimation process is the same either way (assuming the quarantine tank has the same water chemistry as the main aquarium). By following these steps a reef aquarium hobbyist of any level should be able to properly acclimate a new coral specimen to their established reef aquarium.  It is also recommended that the aquarium hobbyist pay close attention to their new coral specimen(s) during acclimation and in the short term afterwords to verify that the coral is doing well and taking to its new environment.
<p>
<b>Helpful Hints:</b>
<p>
&middot;&nbsp;When Acclimating corals, begin with a low level of lighting and gradually work up to a higher level, allowing the coral(s) time to adjust before lighting increases.<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Never introduce an airstone or any other form of aeration into the shipping bag. Aerating the water inside the shipping bag will only convert non-toxic ammonia to a toxic form that will be extremely harmful to the animal.<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium. THESE SPECIES MUST BE KEPT UNDER WATER AT ALL TIMES.<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Do not be too anxious to admire your new specimen. Allow them to adjust to their new home before you expose them to bright lights and attention.<p> saltwater-corals Hobbyist-Guide Administrator :: AquariumDomain.com 2009-07-22 2012-09-27 20:50:01 0 English Acclimating corals /images/corals/article4_acclimate0.jpg Non-abrassive net /images/corals/article4_acclimate1.jpg Plastic tub /images/corals/article4_acclimate2.jpg Plastic cup /images/corals/article4_acclimate3.jpg Aquarium Siphon /images/corals/article4_acclimate4.jpg Aquarium Thermometer /images/corals/article4_acclimate5.jpg This Hobbyist Guide focuses on the steps a hobbyist should take to safely add a marine coral to their reef aquarium. <p>
<b>Acclimating corals into an established reef aquarium</b><br>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This procedure should not take any more than 1 hour to complete.
<p>
<b>Important Note:</b> Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium.
<p>
Before you start, you will need the following:
<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Non-abrasive net<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Plastic or glass cup<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Clean plastic or glass container to keep the specimen during the acclimation process<p>
&middot;&nbsp;A means to access water from your aquarium<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Aquarium Thermometer<p> <p>
<b>Steps to take to properly acclimate a new Coral specimen</b>
<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Open the bag or shipping container and carefully place coral with the water from the bag into the empty bucket or container.<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Add 1 cup of your aquarium water to the bucket slowly.<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Repeat this process adding 1 cup of aquarium water every 5 minutes for 30 minutes.<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Dim or turn off the aquarium lights to help minimize stress on the new coral.<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Carefully remove the coral or clam from the bucket. Be extremely careful when handling live corals not to touch the delicate flesh of the animals.  Try to handle the corals only by their hard skeletons or the plug or coral rubble that they are attached to whenever possible.<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Place your new coral in a location within your reef community that will not place the newly introduced specimens too close to other well established or aggressive species, as they will sting their new competitors. Check on compatibility issues to see where your new coral should be placed in its new home. Remember that many aggressive coral species extend their sweeper tentacles mainly at night, so what may seem to be a peaceful environment during daylight hours may not be once the lights go out.<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Discard the water left in the bucket. <b>EXCEPTION:</b> Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium.<p>
&middot;&nbsp;Keep the aquarium lights off or at a low level and gradually work up to a higher level, allowing the coral(s) time to adjust before returning lighting to full operating levels.  This process should ideally occur over a 2 to 3 hour period.<p>
&middot;&nbsp;At this time your coral species will be ready to coexist with its fellow tank mates.<p> http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=13
5 Beginner Hobbyist Guide: Wet / Dry Filtration systems Wet / Dry filters have become one of the corner stones of a well designed aquarium system.  This hobbyist guide covers the basics of Wet / Dry filters along with their many benefits.  Along with the general aspects of Wet / Dry filters, this guide covers all of the benefits of this type of system including biological filtration, mechanical filtration, water oxygenation, chemical filtration and sump setups.  From the basic Wet / Dry filter to the more recent advancements in these filter systems, this guide bring the aquarium hobbyist up-to-speed on this very desirable aquarium filtration system. <p>
Wet / Dry filtration is a method of filtration that focuses on providing biological, mechanical and chemical filtration for marine or freshwater aquariums.  Wet / Dry filters get their name because the take water from the aquarium via an overflow system and pass the water through the air over a series of porous bio-material which is usually in the form of plastic bio-balls.  While this process gives the filter system its name, the modern Wet / Dry filter system does much more.  While the primary task of a Wet/Dry filter is to provide biological filtration, it is also an excellent filter for both mechanical and chemical filtration as well.  After siphoning the water from the aquarium via a skimmer or overflow system, the water is passed through one or more sponge or filter pad chambers where mechanical filtration takes place as physical particles are removed from the water stream.  At this point the water is passed into the bio-chamber where it drops down onto plastic bio-balls that are piled up on top of a plastic grate at the bottom of the chamber.  This allows the water to pass through the air as it drips through the bio-ball chamber which creates an ideal environment for beneficial aerobic bacteria to live.  It is these aerobic bacteria living on the bio-balls that performs biological filtration on the water as they remove waste products from the water and produce oxygen.  At this point the water drops down into the main sump area of the Wet / Dry Filter system, where chemical filtration can be added along with other filtration devices such as protein skimmers, activated carbon media and much more.  Lastly the water moves into the final chamber which contains the pump to return the water from the Wet / Dry filter sump back into the aquarium.

Since Wet / Dry filters excel  at biological filtration, they have become one of the most important ingredients to a successful aquarium filtration system.  Biological filtration is the process in which ammonia is converted to the less toxic nitrite, then to the non-toxic nitrate.  While nitrate is non-toxic at low levels, it can build up over time and become toxic to most aquarium inhabitants.  Nitrate will need to be removed from the aquarium system either through the use of nitrate eating plants or from water changes where aquarium water is removed and replaced with fresh water that is from a nitrate free source. <p>
<b>Biological</b>
<p>
Wet/Dry systems earned their reputation as excellent biological filters by the method by which they stimulate bacterial growth.  A successful bacteria colony requires moisture, heat and oxygen, all of which a properly maintained Wet / Dry filter will provide in spades.  The temperature of your tank will provide the necessary heat for proper growth, and the moisture is taken care of by the water in your tank.  The process of how the water is siphoned from the aquarium surface and trickled over the biological surface is how the Wet/Dry does the rest by providing the correct environment and living conditions for billions upon billions of beneficial aerobic bacteria colonies to live and thrive.
                      
Each Wet/Dry filter uses its own type and grade of bio material.  Most filters use bio-balls, which are spherical plastic balls which are hollow and have a netted structure that provides large amounts of surface area for beneficial bacteria to live.  Other Wet/Dry filter designs use a structure called Bio Bale, which looks like 'plastic hay' which is also very effective at stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria.  New versions of bio-material and Wet / Dry configurations are popping up within the hobby as filter manufacturers look to further improve on what is already a very effective design. <p>
A Wet / Dry filter system is not simply a good option to consider, it has become the ideal starting point for a high quality filtration system that excels in both freshwater and saltwater aquarium installations.  Due to their popularity, they have expanded with many different variations of the standard Wet / Dry system with expanded sumps, refugiums, Berlin style setups and many more.  Be sure to carefully investigate your options when setting up your next aquarium and find the right Wet / Dry system to fit your aquarium goals. filtration-general filtration-saltwater Hobbyist-Guide Administrator :: AquariumDomain.com 2009-07-23 2011-12-19 23:06:37 0 English Custom Setup /images/article5_image1.jpg Base System /images/article5_image2.jpg Modified system /images/article5_image3.jpg Wet/Dry System /images/article5_image4.jpg Large sump area /images/article5_image5.jpg Megaflow Wet/Dry /images/article5_image6.jpg Berlin Style /images/article5_image7.jpg Dual bio chamber /images/article5_image8.jpg Wet / Dry filters have become one of the corner stones of a well designed aquarium system.  This hobbyist guide covers the basics of Wet / Dry filters along with their many benefits. <p>
<b>Oxygenation</b>
<p>
Firstly the process of skimming the water from the aquariums surface and returning it via the surface of the water creates excellent water agitation which saturates the water with large amounts of dissolved oxygen.  On top of this process, when the water enters the Wet/Dry filter from your tank, it is poured over the biomaterial at a high velocity, as the water flows over the material it mixes with the surrounding air, supersaturating the water with oxygen.  It is this mixing affect that contributes to the name Wet/Dry filtration.  There are even opportunities within the sump portion of the Wet / Dry filter itself for oxygen to be introduced into the water via the return from a device such as a protein skimmer or by passing over additional filter media or substrates where more beneficial bacteria may be present. <p>
<Mechanical Filtration</b>
<p>
While all models of Wet / Dry filters have mechanical filtration via pre-filters in the skimmer box to filtration trays located above the bio material, newer model Wet / Dry filters are constantly improving on this by providing more physical filtration in the form of micro mesh bags, sponge filters and media pads located in various locations throughout the filter system.  Any of the Wet / Dry filter systems commonly available within the aquarium hobby provide not only excellent biological filtration, but top notch mechanical filtration as well.  Additional mechanical filtration would only be necessary in the most extreme of cases where the aquarium inhabitants produce large amounts of physical waste.
<p>
<b>The Sump</b>
<p>
The sump area of the Wet / Dry filter system allows the hobbyist a convenient location to locate chemical filtration, protein skimmers, live rock (saltwater setup), plants, macro algae and much more.  It is now quite common for Wet / Dry filter systems to come with expanded sump sections to allow hobbyists to keep a variety of additional filters and even create refugiums and plant based vegetable filters.  All of these additional forms of filtration make the Wet / Dry filter a complete all-in-one filtration system that is capable of handling all types of marine or freshwater aquarium setups. http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15
6 Beginner Hobbyist Guide: Aquarium Lighting Intensity and Quality in the Home Aquarium Aquarium lighting is more than just illumination of the aquarium itself, there are many important factors to consider when selecting the correct lighting for your home aquarium.  While aquarium lights allow the hobbyist to view their aquariums inhabitants, there are also many other critical roles that aquarium lights play.  Proper aquarium lighting can greatly enhance the appearance of fish, plants, corals and invertebrates along with providing vital health benefits to all types of aquarium life forms.  When choosing the correct aquarium lighting system for a particular aquarium setup, the hobbyist does their best to replicate the natural lighting conditions that their aquarium inhabitants would experience in nature.  Fortunately with the recent advancements in aquarium lighting systems, this has become much easier to do due to the introduction of complex lighting systems that simulate all types of natural lighting environments even nighttime lighting as well.  In order to put together the best lighting for a particular aquariums needs, it is important to know the factors that go into deciding on which lighting system to choose. The main factors involved in choosing the correct aquarium lighting system are the lighting spectral qualities and lighting intensity.  There are many factors the affect the lighting quality and intensity of a lighting system, thus the following factors: water depth, water clarity, water movement and lighting intensity should be taken into consideration before making a lighting system decision.  Understanding the natural conditions of your aquarium inhabitants and their lighting needs along with understanding your home aquarium environment are critical to implementing the best lighting solution for your aquariums needs.  Lastly, this article touches on some common aquarium environments and the best lighting solutions available for each.
<p>
<b>Lighting Spectral Qualities</b><p>
Lighting Spectrum is something most aquarium hobbyists have heard about in connection with aquarium lighting, but probably don't have a full understanding about exactly what it is and what it means for their aquarium inhabitants.  Sunlight is a combination of many types of light blended together, with the red, yellow and green areas of the spectrum being the ones most easily visible to the human eye.  Ultraviolet, in the blue end of the spectrum, is invisible but its effect can be felt very easily as it is this end of the spectrum that causes the warm sun sensation you feel on your skin from the sun and causes sunburn when overexposure occurs.  You can usually feel a quick change in temperature of your skin when a cloud passes over, this signals a decrease in the amount of radiation in a given light field. For humans prolonged exposure to this type of light is dangerous to both our skin and eyes; however, UV radiation also plays an important role in coral, plant & invertebrate health and photosynthesis. <p>
The spectrum of bulbs for aquariums are expressed as a color temperature given or stated in Kelvin degrees. Sunlight has a color temperature of about 5500K, at 12 noon over a tropical reef while actinic light sources typically have a color temperature of about 7100K.  The more blue the light the higher the temperature.  Light is electromagnetic energy in the form of waves, with these waves having frequencies.  As the temperature of a substance increases, the frequency of the light emitted also increases, thus lower temperatures produce red and yellow light, while higher temperatures produce light in the blue end of the spectrum.
<p>
In nature, as light enters and passes through the first 15 feet of water, the red and orange wavelengths are absorbed by the water, increasing the light's Kelvin rating, and giving the light a more blue appearance.  As the light penetrates to 30 feet, the water absorbs the yellow spectrum, and when the light continues past 50 feet, the water filters the green wavelengths, leaving just the blue and violet wavelengths resulting in the light with the highest Kelvin rating.  This is not so noticeable in the home aquarium as we typically do not maintain aquariums with a depth of 15 or more feet!
<p>
Poor quality lighting products not intended for the aquarium hobby typically have Kelvin ratings in the 4300 K range which produces too much red and yellow light.  These lighting products are not only undesirable because they do not provide the needed lighting qualities for most aquarium plants and corals, but they also promote undesirable types of nuisance algae.  While the quality of aquarium lighting and its affects on aquarium inhabitants is extremely important, so is the look or aesthetics of the aquarium as well.  It is important to select bulb types and spectral qualities that satisfy both the needs of your aquariums inhabitants and also provides a pleasing aesthetic for the aquarium hobbyist as well. <p>
When choosing lighting for your aquarium, keep your aquarium inhabitants natural lighting conditions foremost in your mind, while still budgeting for the initial cost of the lighting system and for replacement bulbs.  Other factors such as heat produced from the lighting system, physical size and dimensions of the system and airflow should also be considered before purchasing a lighting system.  Having the correct wattage, Kelvin rating and lighting intensity can mean the difference between an aquarium with beautifully colored fish, thriving plants and corals and a tank overgrown with nuisance algae. lighting-general lighting-saltwater lighting-freshwater Article Administrator :: AquariumDomain.com 2009-07-25 2011-12-19 22:51:27 1 English Lighting Intensity Chart /images/articles/article6_image1.jpg Metal Halide Pendant /images/articles/article6_image2.jpg Coral Tank /images/articles/article6_image3.jpg Intensity Meter /images/articles/article6_image4.jpg Bright Planted Aquarium /images/articles/article6_image5.jpg Spectral Chart /images/articles/article6_image6.jpg Reef Lighting /images/articles/article6_image7.jpg HQI Metal Halide /images/articles/article6_image8.jpg This hobbyist guide talks about lighting spectral quality and intensity of aquarium lighting systems and bulbs for fish-only, planted freshwater and marine reef aquariums <p>
Lighting intensity is measured as Lux at the surface it impacts and as watts when measured at its source.  Since light spreads outward and scatters in all directions, the farther we are from the source the less light we see. The intensity of light decreases by the square of the distance that area is from the lighting source. If a fluorescent bulb is moved 2 inches away from the water, it will be 4 times lower in intensity.  This is an important fact to remember when placing bulbs that appear at first to have the correct amount of intensity for an aquaria. As you raise them higher above the water, the intensity will drop dramatically and you might not have the correct amount of light reaching your animals.  
<p>
Lighting intensity can be affected by other factors other than distance. Turbidity of the water can significantly reduce the actual amount of light that penetrates the surface and reaches the animals. In tanks where activated carbon is used and is changed regularly light penetration into the aquarium can be maximized. Cleaning or removing glass or acrylic lenses from the light hood will also help. The intensity of light above the surface of a reef can be as high as 130,000 lux. The actual amount of intensity that penetrates the surface of the water can be about 70,000, with maybe only 15,000 lux actually reaching the 10-15 meter mark. The water surface also reflects some of the light back, reducing the amount that penetrates the water and reaches the corals.
<p>
Light intensity at the source is measured in watts.  The higher the watts, the more intense the light, and the more energy required to produce the light.  A 100-watt bulb, for example, will give off more light than a 40-watt bulb, and will cost more to use.  A watt is actually related to a lux in that one lux is equal to 1.46 milliwatts (0.00146 watts) of energy of one specific frequency (555 nm) hitting a surface area of one square meter. However, since bulbs used in aquarium lighting systems emit light of many frequencies (not just 555nm), no exact formula can be used when determining the number of lux produced by a bulb of a specific wattage.
<p>
It is also very important to note that aquarium light bulbs begin losing intensity long before they stop emitting light.  The general rule of thumb is to replace aquarium bulbs every 8 to 12 months with some reef aquarium lighting needing replacement every 6 months.  These times will vary based on bulb type and lighting requirements for a particular aquarium, so one should consult the documentation for the bulb type being used." <p>
In nature most corals and invertebrates live in conditions that are lit mostly by blue light waves, thus they have adapted to this and will require bulbs that produce these blue wavelengths in the aquarium environment as well.  While corals and invertebrates thrive under blue light, most hobbyists find aquariums illuminated with blue light only to be unattractive.  This aesthetic dilemma can be solved by combining an actinic light with a white light, such as a 50/50 bulb half blue/white or a light combination in which the white lights give light in the range of 8000 to 12000 K.  This lighting combination gives corals and invertebrates the spectrum necessary for growth, in addition to the spectrum necessary for accurate color rendering within the aquarium.
<p>
Lastly, it is important to consider initial and ongoing operating costs, lighting intensity and spectrum and the heat produced by the lighting system when choosing a lighting system for your saltwater reef aquarium.  Lighting systems for reef aquariums, such as metal halide and HQI systems, tend to be rather expensive due to their high initial cost, high levels of required energy, and characteristically frequent bulb changes.  Lighting systems designed for reef aquariums produce two types of intense heat, which must be addressed prior to installation.  The first type of heat - from the actual bulbs - surrounds the bulbs and should be removed with cooling fans. The second type of heat - radiant heat produced by the lighting system - is unavoidably absorbed by the aquarium water and should be controlled with a water chiller (be sure to budget for a water chiller in your installation plans)." http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?t=16
7 Beginner Beginning Hobbyist Guide: Stocking a Marine Fish-Only Aquarium With the beginner marine aquarium hobbyist in mind, this guide covers the major factors that should be considered when determining the proper stocking levels for a marine fish-only aquarium.  This guide discusses the major factors to consider when choosing what species of fish to keep and in what quantities.  The major areas covered include: oxygen levels, water temperature needs, filtration and fish species and numbers.  The goal of this beginners guide is to give the beginning marine aquarium hobbyist a solid footing with which to make good decisions on how many and which fish they should keep in their new marine aquarium. When stocking a saltwater fish-only aquarium, there are four main areas to consider before you invest in your first fish.  These four very important aspects of stocking a marine aquarium are oxygen levels, Filtration System, Water Temperature and the Fish (or specifically the size and quantity of fish).  The following discussion breaks down each of these areas to provide the beginning marine aquarium hobbyist with the information they need to quickly be on your way to successfully stocking your marine fish aquarium. 
<p> The first consideration to take into account is the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and its replenishment rate.  This is especially true in the case of tropical saltwater fish as they are used to extremely high levels of oxygen in their water.  One must also keep in mind that the warmer the water the less dissolved oxygen that it can hold, but most tropical reef species require less oxygen than their cold water counterparts.  A common mistake is the belief that by forcing bubbles into the water that this will increase oxygen levels, when in fact the bubbles quickly rise to the surface where they release the oxygen back into the air.  The absolute best method to introduce oxygen into the aquarium is through surface water movement or agitation, which is  generally done through a water return from the filter or via a powerhead.   Do to this fact is very important to have a good amount of surface area relative to the amount of fish being kept in the aquarium (something to think about when choosing a tank design).  It is generally thought that for every 1cm of fish body length (excluding the tail) that the aquarium should have 120cm squared of water surface, but of course a good filtration system will greatly reduce this number. The use of a sump or wet/dry filter can increase oxygen levels by increasing overall water volume and by passing the water through the air as it descends into the sump.  Be sure to provide high levels of oxygen in order to keep dissolved oxygen levels high and to facilitate proper biological filtration by aerobic bacteria.
<p> Remember, go slow during the first 6 months to a year, give time for your filtration to catch up each time you add new fish (usually 2 to 4 weeks) and do your best to recreate the methods mother nature uses.  By providing high oxygen levels, biological filtration and protein skimming, quality lighting, controlled additions of new tank mates and keeping in mind the adult size of specimens, you will guarantee yourself many years of successful marine fish keeping.  Good Luck! saltwater-general Beginner Hobbyist Guide Administrator :: AquariumDomain.com 2009-08-05 2009-08-10 00:52:51 1 English /images/article7_image1.jpg /images/article7_image2.jpg /images/article7_image3.jpg /images/article7_image4.jpg /images/article7_image5.jpg /images/article7_image6.jpg /images/article7_image7.jpg /images/article7_image8.jpg Stocking an aquarium is one of the first considerations when setting up any aquarium.  This beginning hobbyist guide looks at stocking a marine fish-only aquarium with the beginner hobbyist in mind. Filtering the water to remove the buildup of fish waste and toxins is extremely important in the aquarium environment where relatively small amounts of water must support a closed community of fish and invertebrate species.  Marine filtration consists of biological, chemical and physical filtration.  The most common filtration methods for the marine fish aquarium are protein skimming, which is the removal of dissolved proteins before they have a chance to break down and fowl the water and biological filtration, which is the method of using beneficial bacteria to breakdown waste products in the water and convert them into the relatively harmless nitrate which is then removed or diluted through water changes.  In terms of stocking your marine fish aquarium the amount and type of filtration you have will ultimately play a large part in how many fish you can keep.  Be sure to use filtration products that are rated for your aquarium size or larger.  Also be sure to combine filtration techniques in order to provide the maximum water quality possible.  You will have to use a water test kit to measure your filtrations effectiveness and to monitor it on an on-going basis.  Remember to go slow when building up your fish stock, especially at the early stages of your aquarium as your biological filtration and nitrogen cycle will be immature and unable to perform properly.
<p>
Another main factor involved in stocking levels is the temperature of the water.  As stated above the warmer the water the less dissolved oxygen that it will hold. Also as stated above cold water specimens require more oxygen then tropical species.  In general most tropical reef species will do best in water that is maintained at a constant 77 to 79 degree range.  Warmer water will decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen as well as promote the rate of chemical breakdown of physical wastes, which cause ammonia and nitrate levels to rise.  Do your best to keep the aquarium water at a constant temperature, as temperature fluctuations will put stress on the fish. The last aspect to keep in mind is the type of inhabitants being kept in the aquarium. Fish species vary greatly in the amount of waste they produce; as well as, their individual oxygen and water quality requirements.  In the beginning of an aquariums life it is recommended that only extremely hardy specimens are kept until the water has adequate time to mature. Some examples of very hardy fish which are tolerant of all but the worst water conditions are: damsels, chromis, clownfish, triggers, and groupers.  Keep in mind though that due to their size and feeding habits triggers and groupers can quickly deteriorate the water quality of an aquarium.  Also be sure to add specimens a few at a time and with at least 2 to 4 weeks between additions to allow the aquarium biological filtration bed to adjust to the new inhabitants.  This is especially critical in the first 6 months of the life of the aquarium. 
<p>
A safe formula to use in stocking a fish only aquarium in the first 6 months to a year, is to add only 1 inch of fish for every 5 U.S. gallons that the aquarium holds (regardless of the filtration). After the first year the amount of fish can be doubled, but be sure to allow time for the filtration system to adjust to the increased load placed upon it.  Keeping in mind all this information the minimum size of marine aquarium should be no less than 30 gallons with at least 432 square inches of surface area.  This will allow enough room for various species to stake out their own territories and co-exist happily without too much squabbling.  Lastly be sure to allow for some hiding spots, so fish can retreat to safety when they feel threatened. http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=17
8 Beginner Beginning Hobbyist Guide - Canister Filtration This Beginning Hobbyist Guide covers all aspects of Canister Filtration.  The hope is that this guide will provide the beginning aquarium hobbyist with answers to all their questions in relation to using canister filtration; as well as, provide them enough information about Canister Filters to make the decision as to whether a Canister Filter fits the filtration needs for their particular aquarium setup. Canister filtration consists of a sealed canister that is typically located either hanging on the aquarium or inside the aquarium stand.  Canister filters use intake and exhaust tubing along with a pressurized canister to water from the aquarium and pass the water through a series of filtration chambers before returning the filtered (clean) water to the aquarium usually through a spill way, spray bar or bio-wheel.  Canister filtration works well for both freshwater and saltwater setups and has become quite popular through its combination of power, efficiency and relatively low cost.  Canister filtration is also a very flexible style of filtration as the canisters themselves can contain a variety of filtration media for many different types of filtration.  For example, a canister filter may have bio-material for biological filtration, sponge or filter material for mechanical filtration and chemical media for chemical filtration all located within separate chambers located within a single canister.  The variety of canister styles and the ability to re-configure a canister for different uses has also helped increase the popularity of canister filters with both freshwater and saltwater hobbyists.
<p> Canister filtration works by drawing water from the aquarium through a plastic intake tube directly into the body of the canister where the water is then pushed through a series of internal chambers, each of which contains one or more types of chemical, biological and mechanical filtration material.  After the water has passed through all of the filtration chambers, it is pumped back into the aquarium through an outtake tube with is connected to either a plastic return elbow, a spray bar or bio-wheel.  The flexibility of the return mechanism is another great feature of a canister filter as the hobbyist is able to increase water flow via a return elbow, water oxygenation via a spray bar or increase biological filtration through the use of a bio-wheel.  Modern canister filters will usually ship with a variety of return options along with all the parts and fittings necessary to setup the canister filter as either a hang-on filter or an in-stand unit.  Canister filters will also contain all required filter media, optional filter media and spare parts and tools used to assemble, maintain and clean the unit.  Generally, canister filters allow you to use a variety of filter media types which are stored in baskets, cartridges, media bags, or isolated chambers within the canister filter.  You can interchange the filter media being used with other filter media types, add more of a particular media type to get more of that type of filtration providing a variety of filtration options.
<p> <p>
Canister filters are very efficient filters if used and maintained correctly.  A well designed canister filter allows the aquarium hobbyist to make adjustments to the type of filtration used within the canister filter thus giving them the advantage using just the right filtration for their tank, rather than being stuck with the manufacturers pre-made media cartridges.  A canister filter usually has lower maintenance requirements than a comparable power filter, because the water is forced through the media, rather than being allowed to flow over or around.  Also, most canister filters give the hobbyist choices in how the clean water is returned to the tank through a spray bar with reduces evaporation and current, via a bio-wheel for increased biological or through a bent pipe return for creating maximum water current.

Canister filters allow aquarium hobbyists to filter large amounts of water using a very compact canister unit, which has many benefits for the aquarium and the hobbyists.  However, the power, efficiency and compact nature of a canister filter also means that it will need to be cleaned regularly in order to remove from the canister all of the pollutants that the canister removed from the aquarium.    While the exact frequency of cleaning will vary from setup to setup based on factors such as aquarium size, canister size (rating), aquarium stocking levels, fish species being kept, whether the aquarium is freshwater or saltwater, etc. it is fairly safe to say that in most setups the canister filter should be inspected and/or serviced every 1 to 2 weeks.  Servicing a canister filter usually entails checking all tubing and fittings to make sure that everything is tightly fastened, checking for any blockage or reduction in efficiency, cleaning the filter material and verifying that the canister is working properly after being serviced  Some media needs to be rinsed out regularly, while other media needs to be replaced.  Check the manufacturers recommendations for the type(s) of media you are using.  In addition to the maintenance required for the filter media, you will also have to periodically clean the tubes and the pump on your canister filter.  This can be done easily with aquarium tube cleaning kits sold at most pet stores. http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=20
9 Beginner Water Dogs!  A crash course in keeping Oscar Cichlids This freshwater Cichlid Hobbyist Guide for Oscars covers everything including an introduction to the species, choosing healthy specimens for your aquarium, acclimation, proper fish and tank care, and information on breeding Oscars. <b>Introduction:</b>
<p>
Astronotus ocellatus, also known as the Oscar, is a fresh water species which is a member of the Cichlid family. Wild Oscars are native to the Amazon River basin (as well as the Orinoco and Paraguay basins) in South America. In their natural environment Oscars are typically found in slow moving, whitewater to blackwater environments and can be found taking cover around and within submerged trees, roots, rocks, vegetation and driftwood.
<p>
Oscars are one of the hardiest and most popular Cichlids in the hobby and they can learn to distinguish their owner(s) from strangers as well as associate them with food. Oscars are very intelligent and will develop and display unique and interesting personalities. In addition to their constant "begging" for food, Oscars can also be trained to eat from their owner's hand; which is why they are sometimes referred to as river or water dogs.
<p>
<b>Choosing your Oscar:</b>
<p>
The original species of Astronotus ocellatus is the Wild Oscar (also referred to as the Common Oscar); the Wild Oscar is the only Oscar that can be found in it's natural habitat in the wild (aside from various "pets" that have been released in ponds, lakes, canals, and rivers within sub-tropical or tropical environments). All other varieties of the Oscar have been bred exclusively for the aquarium trade, including varieties with red marbling, albino, leucistic, and xanthistic. Red Oscars, Tiger Oscars, Red Tiger Oscars, Red Lutino Oscars, Lemon Oscars, Platinum Oscars, Gold Oscars, Copper Oscars, Albino Tiger Oscars, Albino Red Oscars... the list goes on. There are also veil-tail (long-finned) versions of all the various forms in the aquarium trade, but it's not recommended that they be kept with other Oscars or aggressive Cichlids; as their fins are delicate and are prone to damage, which can cause various fin diseases or infections.
<p>
When choosing an Oscar, make sure to examine it closely before you decide to purchase it. Keep an eye out for the ones that are very alert and active. Don't choose one that is acting completely different from the rest, seems to be lethargic or just happens to be lying on the bottom of the tank pouting or possibly not feeling too well. A healthy Oscar is always alert and looking for food.
<p>
If you plan to purchase a mature Oscar, keep an eye out for any pitting or holes that may have devleoped on it's head; It's a sure sign of Hole in the Head Disease.
<p>
Also make sure your future pet Oscar does not have any small white spots (similar to tiny grains of salt) on it as it's a sure sign that it has been infected by Ick (an Ichthyophthirius multifilis parasite).
<p> <b>So, you brought home a new Oscar for your tank...</b>
<p>
The water chemistry at a fish store is usually fairly neutral at a pH of around 7.0 and the GH and KH can very greatly, not to mention that it can also contain various nasty parasites. When introducing a new Oscar to a tank, you can't go wrong with the "drip" method as even baby Oscars have been known to tear little holes in the store bags and nobody wants fish store water in their tanks.
<p>
Carefully empty the contents of the bag (including the water) into a container. Take some airline tubing and set up a siphon drip line from the target aquarium to the container with your new Oscar. If you don't have an airline control valve handy, you can tie a couple loose knots in the airline to control the rate of water flow (it's also recommended that you secure the airline tubing in place with an airline holder or some other method). Start a siphon by sucking on the end of the airline tubing you'll be placing into the container. When water begins flowing through the tubing, it's time to adjust the drip (either by adjusting the control valve or tightening one or both of the knots) to a rate of 2-4 drips per second. When the amount of water in the bucket doubles, empty half of it and start the drip again until the volume doubles again. Repeat this process for about one hour and then your new Oscar is ready to be netted and moved to your target aquarium.
<p>
New Oscars will often pout. If your new Oscar swims to the bottom of the tank and lays on one side, looking up at you with an untrusting eye, don't panic, it may just be a little stressed and will soon get over it and snap into action, exploring its new home. Current, resident Oscars consider new Oscars a threat as well as intruders in their territory. The bigger the Oscars are, the bigger the fight can be. They will sort things out, but there maybe be a few bruises and hurt feelings in the process.
<p>
<b>In the Aquarium:</b>
<p>
Oscars are excellent for breaking in a beginning Cichlid hobbyist as they are a very hardy species and their owner(s) will learn a lot about the care and habits of predatory fish, water conditions, filtration and how much fun it can be to have a Cichlid tank. Oscars can live for 12 to 16 years and it's important to understand that Oscars are a long-term commitment.
<p>
In their natural environment, Oscars can be found in acidic blackwater conditions as well as neutral whitewater conditions with a pH anywhere from 4.5 to 7.5. In an aquarium environment, Oscars will thrive in conditions with a pH ranging from 5.0 to 7.0 and a temperature between 74°-84° F; When it comes to water hardness, the GH should be around 3 to 7 and the KH ranging from 2 to 4. 
<p>
Oscars are one of the fastest growing aquarium fish in the hobby and baby Oscars are usually sold at the fish store at around one to two inches long. Those babies will easily gain one inch a month for the first eight months. Expect those babies to be seven or eight inches by the time they are a year old. Ideally, a single Oscar should be kept in a tank that is no less than 75 gallons and a 110-125 gallon tank is recommended for two. Oscars are greedy, big and messy eaters and produce a considerable biological load within their environment. Therefore, the two most vital components for Oscars are tank size and filtration; a large tank with an efficient amount of quality filtration will play a vital role in keeping your Oscar(s) happy and healthy.
<p>
Oscars love to decorate and will rearrange their environment to their liking by digging large pits within the substrate and relocating rocks and other objects (including submersed heaters and thermometers). Oscars are very powerful fish and can and will move almost anything in the tank aside from large pieces of driftwood. As far as live plants go, Amazon and various Swords are recommended as they will grow powerful root structures and may be too difficult to move. Most other live plants will either be uprooted or shredded. Oscars have also been known to actually break heaters, filter intakes, under-gravel filter stems, and floating thermometers.  Sometimes the wreckage is from an accident, other times it's on purpose as the Oscar was using that floating thermometer as a toy. If you want to give your Oscars a toy to play with, occasionally throw a clean ping-pong ball into the tank and enjoy the show.

Oscars are the beginner's species of New World Cichlids and an introduction to the more aggressive species, but despite their size (average of 14 inches in the aquarium), predatory nature, and the fact that Oscars like to play rough, they are not considered to be an aggressive species themselves, as long as their tank mates are too large to be mistaken for food (an Oscar will eat any fish that can fit its mouth). Oscars mainly show signs of aggression when they are feeding, getting ready to breed, arguing over territory, or when they want some exercise. Unlike the more aggressive Cichlids, Oscars are not known to incessantly bully or terrorize their tank mates for no apparent reason. First-time Oscar owners often panic when they see their first Oscar argument. Expect occasional arguments, that's what Oscars do; Oscars like to test their tank mates. They may try and bully other fish once in a while, but will not usually persist if the other fish can get out of their way fast enough. In addition to a nip here and a bite there, Oscars will fight and test each others strength by jaw or lip locking and will wrestle and tug on each other, which can sometimes lead to some nasty scrapes and abrasions. Don't immediately separate Oscars or tank mates when you see aggressive behavior. Observe them for a little while and see how it goes. It should become apparent if it's a short argument, a change of command, a breeding ritual, or an all out war. MelaFix is an excellent, natural medication that promotes quick tissue regeneration and wound healing and it highly recommended for any Cichlid tank.
<p>
If you end up with enough room for some tank mates to keep your Oscar(s) company, be very wary of small Catfish and small Plecos. An Oscar will eat any fish that it can fit in its mouth and Plecos and catfish have sharp, strong barbs that can kill the Oscar that gets one stuck in its mouth or throat. Catfish and Plecos can make great tank mates, but be sure to get them large enough so that an Oscar can't fit them in it's mouth. Silver Dollars and various Geophagus species also make great tank mates as they are fairly peaceful and very tough. It's possible to add other Cichlids as tank mates, but there will be arguments for sure. There have been tanks housing Oscars, Pike, Jack Dempseys, Arowana, Peacock Bass, and Managuense, but it's hit or miss and only recommended that an experienced hobbyist makes the attempt. 
<p> <b>In conclusion:</b>
<p>
Oscars can be a lot of fun and are a great introduction to predatory fishkeeping. They are truly a species that will bring a lot of personality and activity to any freshwater Cichlid aquarium. Remember to keep their water clean and they will thrive and offer years of enjoyment and excitement for the beginner to intermediate hobbyist. freshwater-cichlid-NW Hobbyist Guide B.D. 2009-08-18 2009-08-18 23:17:58 1 English /images/article9_image1.jpg /images/article9_image2.jpg /images/article9_image3.jpg /images/article9_image4.jpg /images/article9_image5.jpg /images/article9_image6.jpg /images/article9_image7.jpg /images/article9_image8.jpg Aquarium hobbyist guide for keeping the Oscar Cichlid, a freshwater, New World Cichlid fish species. <b>Feeding Oscars:</b>
<p>
The first thing that should be noted is that Oscars require vitamin C and will develop health problems in its absence.
<p>
Oscars are omnivorous (more accurately, facultative piscivores); They love live foods and enjoy the chase (your live plants won't). Feeding Oscars live fish can make them more aggressive (some hobbyists like this idea) and most readily available live feeders have little to no nutritional value. Goldfish and Rosy Red minnows should be taken out of the mix completely due to being extremely fatty and rich in a chemical called thiaminase (an enzyme that destroys the essential nutrient thiamine, also known as vitamin B1). In addition to being a catalyst for vitamin deficiency, Goldfish and Rosy Reds also have the ability to introduce some nasty parasites and bacteria into the aquarium which can cause a number of different diseases (Ick and velvet are extremely easily transmitted between feeder fish).
<p>
Baby Oscars (until they reach 1 month) should be fed 3 times a day with live, frozen, or freeze-dried: Brine shrimp, blood worms, black worms, tubifex worms, and/or small shreds of frozen krill. Once the Oscars are a little older they should also be given beef heart, white cloud minnows, ghost shrimp, and river shrimp, as well as mealworms and small Cichlid pellets. As the Oscars get more mature (5+ inches), they should be fed 2 times a day with, earthworms, frozen krill, shrimp, medium Cichlid pellets, live crickets, peas, lettuce, pieces of cooked or fresh fish, and minnows. When the Oscars grow even larger (8+ inches), they should be fed 1 to 2 times a day (2 if you give in to their begging or want them to reach full size quickly) with all of the previously mentioned foods in addition to large Cichlid pellets and cooked mussels as well as an occasional small frog, large tadpole, or crayfish. Feed your Oscars a wide variety of the foods listed and they will have all the nutrition they could ever need.
<p>
<b>Oscar Health:</b>
<p>
Home aquariums contain insignificant volumes of water compared to an Oscar's natural environment. In the wild, Oscars rarely encounter excess amounts of ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, and harmful organisms and they are much more resistant to infection due to the relatively low concentration of harmful chemicals and organisms in such a massive volume of water. Although, in a home aquarium, biological waste can pollute the water extremely fast and if left unchecked, water chemistry can become extremely toxic to Oscars and harmful organisms can multiply exponentially and will infect them with disease and serious illness. However, if Oscars are well cared for and their water chemistry is maintained at optimal levels, Oscars can easily resist any effects from harmful organisms in very low or nonexistent concentrations.
<p>
Water changes (at least 25%) should be carried out every 2 weeks (or more or less frequently, depending how efficient your aquarium filtration is). Oscars are very hardy fish, but they are also big and messy eaters and eventually they will have health problems if their water chemistry is not maintained; filthy water is usually where "one-eyed" Oscars come from as well as Oscars that have developed HITH (Hole-in-the-Head) disease.
<p>
There are a number of different freshwater fish diseases and parasitic infestations out there, but the following two are the most common with Oscars:
<p>
Hole-in-the-Head Disease (HITH): Oscars are known to be susceptible to a nasty disease called Hole-in-the-Head; Other common names for this disease are Freshwater Head and Lateral Line Erosion (FHLLE) and Hexamita Disease. Nobody really knows the true cause of this disease, and although it can be fatal, if treated early and properly your Oscar can survive (aside from permanent scarring). Signs of HITH include pitted lesions on the head and lateral line. HITH will be mild at first, but if not treated, pitting will become more intense and secondary bacterial and fungal infections can develop, which will eventually lead to a severe infection and the Oscar will become systemically ill with eventual loss of appetite and life. HITH can be treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole, or a combination of MelaFix and PimaFix can be used.
<p>
Ich (Ichthyophthirius multifilis): Also referred to as White Spot, is a burrowing parasitic infestation that causes the skin of the fish to swell and produce white cysts that can be observed as small white spots covering your Oscar to varying degrees. An early symptom (before the spots are visible) is usually when your Oscars continuously scratch themselves on rocks, substrate and driftwood. In the more advanced stages, the Oscar will become lethargic and will eventually develop redness or bloody streaks across its body. Although the infestation itself is similar to a human skin infection, it can be the death of an Oscar with poor nutrition and water conditions. Ich can be treated by first doing a 25 to 50% water change, then raise your aquarium temperature to 86° F, discontinue any carbon filtration, add a normal dose (listed on the box) of freshwater aquarium salt and obverse the situation for 2 weeks. If things don't clear up, repeat them again and add normal doses of MelaFix and PimaFix as well and observe for another 2 weeks. That should do the trick. One of the best ways to avoid Ich and other parasites is to quarantine new fish in a separate tank for two weeks while performing the full Ich treatment (with MelaFix and PimaFix) before introducing them to your main tank.
<p>
One thing that every Oscar owner will have to get used to is that Oscars have a tendency to get cuts and abrasions as well as fin damage once in a while; Either from playing rough with other Oscars or tank mates, or even just bumping into various objects (heaters, driftwood, rocks, filter equipment, etc.) in the tank while chasing food, Oscars seem to always get hurt at some point and it can be quite disturbing for newcomers seeing these injuries for their first time. Although some of these injuries may look rather serious, they are actually superficial wounds and Oscars will quickly heal on their own. Keep their water clean and they will be fine. No medication is necessary, but if you want to help speed up the healing process you can add a normal dose of MelaFix to the tank to speed up the tissue regeneration process.
<p> <b>Oscar Breeding:</b>
<p>
Oscars are monomorphic and it's almost impossible to sex them (it is impossible to sex young Oscars), but at breeding time you will have a around 4 days to attempt to sex your Oscars; a males breeding tube can be observed as being small and pointy where the female's egg tube is larger and more oval at the end. Unfortunately, two females will sometimes pair off and lay eggs together and several infertile clutches will eventually let you know that you have two females instead of a breeding pair. Unfertilized eggs are milky white while fertilized eggs are tanish to amber.
<p>
A breeding pair of Oscars can be conditioned for spawning by feeding them live food such as freshwater shrimp, minnows, frogs and crayfish. A pair of Oscars will usually test each other with a jaw/lip-locking, breeding ritual and once they both pass, they may chase each other around for a little while and then they will begin cleaning off rocks in the aquarium. At this time it's recommended to provide them with a large slab of slate where the female can lay her eggs as Oscars will not lay eggs on substrate. Once the Oscars clean off the area, the female will lay her eggs (up to 1000) and the male will fertilize them. While Oscars are breeding, they are extremely protective of their area and no other fish will be allowed near it.
<p>
The eggs will hatch in 3 to 5 days and the fry will look like a wiggling mass with tails, attached to the slate; as they start to absorb their yolk sacs, they will eventually fall to the substrate in a sticky blob. Once the fry are done with their yolk sacs (around 4 days), they will begin swimming on their own and will be ready to consume gargantuan quantities of baby brine shrimp (their water will need to be changed often). Because Oscars will care for their eggs and practice brood care for their newly hatched fry, it is safe to leave the fry with their parents for about a month, after which they should be relocated to another tank. Some breeders will move the slate and attached eggs to a different tank (using the same water) after they are fertilized, for fear of the parents may eat them. If the slate is relocated into another tank, the eggs will hatch on their own, but beware of Oscar attacks while trying to remove their eggs.

10 Beginner Hobbyist Guide: Aquarium bulb types for freshwater and saltwater aquariums This hobbyist guides talks about the different types of lighting systems available to the freshwater and saltwater aquarium hobbyist, with a focus on the different bulb types and fixtures. <b>Aquarium lighting overview...</b>
<p>
To the average person viewing an aquarium they see the lighting system as just a means to illuminate the aquarium so that people can see the inhabitants.  However, the aquarium hobbyist knows that aquarium lighting plays a much more important role in the aquarium ecosystem than just illumination.  Proper aquarium lighting for a particular aquarium setup provides illumination, photosynthetic energy source for plants and corals, brings out vibrant coloration in fish, plants, corals and invertebrates, helps grow beneficial macro-algae and plants, as well as inhibits nuissance algae from growing.  In fact proper aquarium lighting is essential for any system that contains photosynthetic organisms such as plants, anemones, or corals.  Beyond being a source of energy for plants and corals, lighting also influences fish behavior and physiology and is vital for the overall health and well-being of the entire aquarium.
<p>
<b>Lighting fixture types...</b>
<p>
There are a wide variety of different light bulbs and light fixtures availabe for aquarists to choose from depending on their aquarium setup.  The large selection of available aquarium lighting options allows aquarists of all levels and monetary budgets to find the right lighting setup to create the desired lighting conditions for their particular aquarium inhabitants.  Aquarium light fixtures are generally grouped into three general categories: Standard output fluorescent lighting, compact fluorescent lighting, and high intensity metal halide lighting.
<p> <b>Standard Output Fluorescent Lighting</b>
<p>
These are versatile lighting systems that are the easiest and most cost efficient way to illuminate an aquarium.  Fluorescent light fixtures are a great choice for fresh and saltwater fish-only aquariums or for hobbyists on a limited budget.  The wide selection of bulbs available for these easy-to-use, affordable, and energy-efficient light fixtures allows hobbyists to customize aquarium lighting to allow the right light for their aquarium inhabitants.
<p>
<b>Compact Fluorescents</b>
<p>
Compact fluorescent provide a higher light output version of the standard fluorescent lighting system.  Instead of single tube bulbs, compact fluorescent systems incorporate dual or quad tube bulbs for greater light output from a single bulb.  A single compact fluorescent light fixture easily does the job of two standard fluorescent fixtures, which saves space and makes compact fluorescent systems a great choice when upgrading from standard fluorescent systems.  Compact fluorescent lighting systems are no more difficult to operate and maintain than standard fluorescent lighting systems, with self-contained ballists, caps and wiring, these lighting systems are easy to operate and provide all the benefits of fluorescent lighting; such as, low operating cost, lower heat emission, and a wide selection of bulbs with color temperatures ideal for both freshwater and marine applications.
<p> <b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
Choosing the correct lighting setup for your freshwater or saltwater aquarium is more than just a matter of aesthetics or personal taste.  Lighting systems play an important role in the overall health of many aquarium species; as well as, contribute greatly to the overall health of the aquarium ecosystem itself.  The right lights will go along way towards producing a working aquarium eco-system that will provide the inhabitants with a healthy living environment and the hobbyist with a beautiful and rewarding aquarium that will provides many hours of enjoyment. lighting-general lighting-saltwater lighting-freshwater Hobbyist Guide Administrator :: AquariumDomain.com 2009-08-21 2011-12-19 22:54:14 1 English /images/article10_image1.jpg /images/article10_image2.jpg /images/article10_image3.jpg /images/article10_image4.jpg /images/article10_image5.jpg /images/article10_image6.jpg /images/article10_image7.jpg /images/article10_image8.jpg Hobbyist Guide covering the variety of available aquarium bulbs for use within the aquarium hobby. <b>Metals Halides</b>
<p>
Metal halide systems are high intensity discharge (HID) lighting systems that are very popular with aquarium hobbyists who keep live planted freshwater setups and coral or reef saltwater setups.  Metal halide bulbs are comprised of a main glass bulb with a series of wires connecting another glass bulb (arc tube) within it. When electricity passes through the arc tube, the gases and metal salts contained within the tube produce light.  Metal halide fixtures are ideal for freshwater planted aquariums with plants that require high intensity lighting or for reef aquariums with corals, invertebrates and macro algae that require high lighting conditions.  Metal halide systems are also used for very large aquariums or aquariums deeper than 24 inches where other lighting systems may not be powerful enough to provide adequate illumination.  Metal halide systems do have some downsides in that they are generally the most expensive lighting system available in the hobby with expensive fixtures and bulbs, produce the most heat and use the most electricity of any of the common aquarium lighting systems.
<p>
<b>Bulb types...</b>
<p>
<b>50/50 Bulbs</b><br>
50/50 or Actinic White Bulb 50/50 or Actinic White Bulbs are a blend of white and blue light that helps recreate marine lighting conditions. Typically 50/50 bulbs are a combination of 10,000°K white light and blue actinic light. The blended light of the 50/50 bulb helps encourages photosynthetic coral growth while providing aquarium lighting that is bright, vibrant and pleasing to the human eye.
<p>
<b>Color-Enhancing Bulbs</b><br>
Color-Enhancing Bulb Color emit light from the "warmer" end of the color spectrum to augment or enrich color.  These bulbs are designed with fish coloration in mind and will bring out the most vibrant colors of both freshwater and marine fish species.
<p>
<b>Full Spectrum/Daylight Bulb</b><br>
Full Spectrum/Daylight Bulbs are intended to simulate natural sunlight by emitting all the wavelengths of visible light and closely approximates the visual effects of natural sunlight.  This Contains a blend of all the colors of the color spectrum. These general-purpose bulbs are ideal for all types of fresh and saltwater aquariums.
<p> <b> Actinic Bulb</b><br>
Actinic bulbs concentrate on the blue end of the color spectrum by producing a penetrating blue light that is useful for reaching the lower regions of deeper aquariums that are over 36 inches in depth.  By recreating the light conditions found in deep water, actinic bulbs have become a mainstay in reef aquariums where they provide the necessary light energy for proper photosynthetic coral growth.
<p>
<b>Plant Bulb</b><br>
Plant Bulbs focus on the light spectrums that stimulates plant growth, which is typically between 5500°k and 7500°k. With peak light emissions in both the red and blue regions of the color spectrum, this light maximizes photosynthetic activity for lush planted aquariums.
<p>
<b>Super Daylight Bulb</b><br>
Super Daylight bulbs or High-Intensity bulbs emit an extremely bright light with a color temperature or Kelvin rating ranging from 10,000°K to 20,000°K.  The light is an intense white light that is usually used in combination with actinic blue bulbs to provide a full spectrum lighting solution that is best suited for reef aquariums and large marine aquariums.  The combination of these two bulb types creates a more eye please color combination than simply an extremely bright white light.

1 Anthelia Waving Hand Coral Anthelia sp. The Anthelia Waving Hand Coral or Glove Coral is a group of colonial animals with several individual polyps attached to a piece of rock.  Under proper conditions, these colonies will grow out and cover adjacent rock, giving a mat like appearance.  Waving Hand Corals can range in color from pink,  blue, brown, or tan and their polyps have the distinctive eight-leaved tentacles associated with all of the members of this family.  While they do not pulse like xenia corals, they do wave in the water currents, which gives them their common name.  This species is best kept by a moderate to advanced reef aquarist in a mature reef aquarium with strong water movement and intense quality lighting.
<p>
The Anthelia Waving Hand Coral is similar in appearance to the xenia coral, but the Waving Hand Coral does not require quite as intense lighting and prefers bottom locations within the reef aquarium.  Moderate to high lighting levels with either power compact fluorescents or T5 fluorescents should be adequate for aquariums 25 inches in height or less.  On deeper aquariums, metal halides should be used to make sure that adequate lighting intensity makes it to the bottom of the aquarium where Waving Hand Corals are typically placed.  Indirect medium to strong water currents are required, along with excellent water quality.  Ideally this species should be kept in an established reef aquarium so that it can supplement its diet with planktonic foods via filter feeding.  It is important to position this species away from other soft corals and sessile invertebrates and to allow adequate room for growth, as under the right conditions, this species can grow rapidly.  Under correct conditions, the Waving Hand Coral will spread laterally over adjacent rockwork forming a mat like appearance on the rocks.
<p>
Anthelia Waving Hand Corals receive much of their nutrition through their symbiotic zooxanthellae algae that is hosted within their bodies.  This algae creates energy for the coral through photosynthesis, which requires moderate to high intense aquarium lighting.  This species is also a filter feeder and requires strong currents that it can filter plankton or other micro foods from the current to supplement its nutritional needs.  Weekly feedings of micro-foods designed for filter feeding invertebrates should be fed to this species via water currents or pipette. Moderate Medium to Strong Bottom Peaceful Moderate to High 72-78°F; sg 1.023-1.025;  pH 8.1-8.4; dKH 8-12 Iodine, Trace Elements Brown, Tan, Pink, Blue Xeniidae Polyp Corals nano_reef 2009-02-12 17:19:00 /images/marineCoral-Anthelia.jpg /images/corals/wavingHand1.jpg /images/corals/wavingHand2.jpg /images/corals/wavingHand3.jpg /images/corals/wavingHand4.jpg Polyp Corals http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=158 31
2 Birdsnest Coral Seriatopora hystrix The Birdsnest Coral is also commonly referred to by many names within the reef aquarium hobby including: Seriatopora Bird's Nest, Needle, Finger, and Brush Coral.  The Birdsnest Coral is a small polyp stony (SPS) coral with very delicate, thin branches with needle-like tips and is found in a variety of shades of pink.  This species is very delicate, but offers a very attractive coral that has diverse shapes and bright coloration.  The Birdsnest Coral should only be kept by advanced reef aquarists with established reef tank systems.
<p>
The Birdsnest Coral requires both strong lighting and moderate water current to maintain proper health and bright coloration.  When kept under the right conditions, the Birdsnest Coral can grow quickly and obtain a variety of different shapes.  It is important to place this species within the aquarium to allow for its growth and still provide it with the strong lighting and moderate waterflow that it needs to thrive.  For continued good health, it will also require the addition of calcium, strontium, and other trace elements to the water.
<p>
When kept in an established reef aquarium with proper lighting, water chemistry and movement, the Birdsnest Coral will not require additional feeding.  However, it will feed on micro-plankton and foods designed for filter feeding invertebrates. Difficult Medium Middle to Top Peaceful High 72-78°F; sg 1.023-1.025;  pH 8.1-8.4; dKH 8-12 Calcium, Trace Elements Pink, Purple Pocilloporidae Indo-Pacifc SPS Hard Corals 2009-02-12 00:00:00 /images/marineCoral-Birdsnest.jpg /images/corals/birdsnestCoral1.jpg /images/corals/birdsnestCoral2.jpg /images/corals/birdsnestCoral3.jpg /images/corals/birdsnestCoral4.jpg SPS Hard Corals http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=159 empty
3 Black Tube Coral Tubastrea micrantha The Black Tube Coral is a large polyp stony (LPS) coral, also commonly referred to as the Black Sun Coral. It is a very dark olive green to black colonial coral, markedly different than others within the species. It is often found on reef ledges or steep reef slopes in the wild, where it feeds on drifting zooplankton. Its skeleton has tubes branching in all directions.  They should be placed into rockwork and prefer to be beneath a ledge where they will be shaded from high light.  They are a low light species, but do require medium to strong water movement in order to feed on zooplankton that drifts by.
<p>
Be careful when handling the Tube Coral; it can be fragile and needs to be picked up by its underside when placing it in the aquarium. Moderate to strong water current combined with low lighting levels will provide a good aquarium environment in which the Black Tube Coral can thrive. Usually, it will only expand its polyps in the evening unless it is hungry, when it may expand its polyps during the day.  The tentacles have stinging cells that can shoot tiny poison darts into their prey or can even be used as a defense mechanism if necessary, but generally this species is peaceful with other if not overcrowded.
<p>
While it is a hardy coral for the reef aquarium, it is classified as moderately difficult to maintain because it has special dietary needs. It is one of the few corals that does not contain the symbiotic algae zooxanthellae. Instead, it must be regularly fed vitamin-enriched brine shrimp or micro-plankton from an eyedropper directly to each of its polyps to promote rapid polyp budding. It will also benefit from the addition of calcium, strontium, and other trace elements to the water. Moderate Medium to Strong Any Peaceful Low 72-78&deg;&nbsp;F; sg 1.023-1.025; pH 8.1-8.4; dKH 8-12 Calcium, Strontium, Trace Elements Olive Green, Black Dendrophylliidae Indo-Pacific LPS Hard Corals 2009-03-15 00:00:00 /images/marineCoral-BlackTube.jpg /images/corals/blackTubeCoral1.jpg /images/corals/blackTubeCoral2.jpg /images/corals/blackTubeCoral3.jpg /images/corals/blackTubeCoral4.jpg LPS Hard Corals http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=160 empty
4 Closed Brain Coral Favites spp. Maintenance for the Closed Brain Corals (Favites Brain Coral) is relatively easy, making them excellent choices for both beginner and expert hobbyist. They require only moderate lighting combined with moderate water movement within the aquarium. While they do not require high intensity lighting, Pineapple Brain Corals should be given full spectrum lighting usually 6500K with Actinic Blue combination and they will also do fine with more intense lighting systems. Water movement should be moderate, they should not be subjected to any direct continuous current.

To maintain Closed Brain Corals in good health, calcium, strontium, and other trace elements should be added to the water. They will also benefit from the addition of supplemental meaty foods in the form of micro-plankton or brine shrimp. They should be fed twice per week in the evening while the tentacles are visible.  The Closed Brain Corals are large polyp stony (LPS) corals often referred to as Moon, Pineapple, Brain, Favites Brain, Star, Worm, or Honeycomb Coral. They are the most common and prolific coral in the world, and are very similar to the genus Favia, sharing many of the same common names, and sometimes being very difficult to differentiate. Closed Brain Corals are found in various color forms and polyp shapes. "Pineapple Coral" is the name commonly given to those that have smaller circular patterns with a tan-ish brown outer ridges and vibrant green inner crevices. Favite Corals are aggressive, expanding their sweeper tentacles at night well beyond their base. It is important to leave space between them and neighbors in the reef aquarium, so that other corals are not stung by the sweeper tentacles.
<p>
Maintenance for the Closed Brain Corals (Favites Brain Coral) is relatively easy, making them excellent choices for both beginner and expert hobbyist. They require only moderate lighting combined with moderate water movement within the aquarium. While they do not require high intensity lighting, Pineapple Brain Corals should be given full spectrum lighting usually 6500K with Actinic Blue combination and they will also do fine with more intense lighting systems. Water movement should be moderate, they should not be subjected to any direct continuous current.

6 Bubble Coral Plerogyra sp. Bubble Corals are both unique and attractive in their appearance.  With both attractive colors and a unique bubble like appearance they provide a stark contrast to many other Indo-Pacific LPS corals.  They have a white-ridged hard skeleton that can be seen only when the polyps are deflated.  When inflated, the large skin like polyps will cover the entire coral skeleton, giving this species a white, yellowish or pink coloration.  Like many other LPS corals, this species posses sweeper tentacles that can harm other near by corals, making it important to think about the position and placement in the aquarium.
<p>
Bubble Corals require moderate lighting levels combined with low to moderate water flow to flourish in the home aquarium.  Too much water flow will prevent the coral from fully expanding its fleshly polyps.  These polyps are very fragile and will puncture easily, thus it is very important to handle these corals with the utmost care and only by the hard skeletal base.  Because Bubble Corals have long sweeper tentacles, be sure to place them in a location that will provide plenty of room between themselves and other species to prevent damage being done to its neighbors.  As with most corals the Bubble Coral will benefit from the addition of calcium, strontium and other trace elements added periodically to the water.
<p>
Bubble Corals utilize the symbiotic algae zooxanthellae from which it receives the majority of its nutrition through photosynthesis. They also benefit from occasional feedings of meaty items; such as, brine shrimp or micro-plankton. They should be offered food when the tentacles are fully expanded, which is typically during the night time hours.

7 Bullseye Mushroom Rhodactis inchoata The Rhodactis Bullseye Mushroom is also known as the Tonga Blue Mushroom and is less commonly referred to as a Hairy or Small Elephant Ear Mushroom.  The Bullseye Mushroom usually is a violet to blue color, often with margins and highlights of green and may have a red mouth area, with papillae that form cauliflower-like patterns, and can grow up to 3 inches in diameter.  This is a relatively easy species to care for and can thrive with lower lighting and waterflow.  The Bullseye Mushroom makes a good coral for beginner reef aquarists in that it is relatively easy to care for and is a very attractive specimen.
<p>
It is very easy to maintain the Bullseye Mushroom in the reef aquarium, mostly because it prefers low to medium lighting and low water movement.  The Bullseye Mushroom  is less tolerant of bright light compared to other Rhodactis sp., prefering reduced lighting, which normally requires that is be placed in the lower regions of the aquarium or where it is partially shaded.  It is a semi-aggressive species and requires adequate space between itself and other corals so as not to damage any nearby neighbors.  Longitudinal fission is the primary means of reproduction and it normally is sold as several individual mushrooms attached to one rock.
<p>
The Bullseye Mushroom Coral receives most of its nutrition requirements through the symbiotic algae zooxanthellae hosted within its body through photosynthesis, which provide the majority of its nutrition.  It may also eat plankton and small invertebrates which can be provided through supplemental liquid foods.

8 Button Polyp Protopalythoa sp. The Protopalythoa Button Polyp Corals, are also commonly referred to within the aquarium hobby as Moon Polyps, Encrusting Anemones, or Sea Mats, are generally brown or tan in color, but may also be green and fluoresce under actinic lighting. Button Polyp Corals are a colonial animal with multiple individual polyps attached to a piece of live rock or coral rubble.  Over time with proper aquarium conditions Button Polyp Corals will grow out with more and more colonies being produced and over time can create a mat or carpet like appearance.
<p>
Button Polyp Corals are very easy to maintain in an established reef aquarium with only moderate water flow and lighting being required.  Their polyps have the ability to sting other animals and are semi-aggressive; therefore, they need to have space between their colony and any other neighbors. Button Polyp Corals grow rapidly and will crowd out their neighbors including any sessile life; it is this rapid growth and the resulting appearance that gives them the name Sea Mats.  Button Polyp Corals will reproduce easily in the reef aquarium by budding (splitting off a portion of their base or mouth), which will increase the size of their colony.  For continued good health, they will also require the addition of iodine and other trace elements to the water.  As with other semi-aggressive fast growing corals, be sure to place this species where it will have room to grow without coming into contact with other specimens.
<p>
Button Polyp Corals receive most of their nutrition through the symbiotic algae zooxanthellae hosted within their bodies, which provides the majority of their nutritional requirements through photosynthesis. Button Polyp Corals will also benefit from weekly feedings of micro-plankton or brine shrimp which should be fed to each individual of the colony.

9 Candy Cane Coral Caulastrea furcata The Candy Cane Coral is a large polyp stony (LPS) coral often referred to as either Trumpet, Torch, Candy, or Bullseye Coral. Its genus name, Caulastrea, comes from the Latin kaulos (stalk), and aster (star) describing its skeletal structure consisting of tubular stalks with stars on each tip. The large circular polyps are vibrant green, yellow, blue and brown.  The Candy Cane Coral from Fiji are generally a brilliant greenish/teal and brown, and the tips are white.  With quality lighting such as metal halides or combination 10,000k & actinic blue power compacts, the Candy Cane Coral will stand out amongst the crowd with it's brilliant coloration.  As corals go the Candy Cane coral is a hardy species when kept in an environment with moderate water movemoment and medium to strong lighting.
<p>
The Candy Cane Coral requires moderate water movement and moderate to strong lighting in the aquarium environment.  It makes a great addition to the reef aquarium with its' brilliant coloration and passive nature.  Unlike many corals, the Candy Cane coral has very short sweeper tentacles, which allows it to be kept in close quarters with other corals without harming them.  Due to its need for only moderate lighting combined with very short sweeper tentacles, the Candy Cane coral can live in many areas within a reef aquarium and do very well.
<p>
The Candy Cane coral has short sweeper tentacles, which will necesitate the need to provide some supplemental nutrients through weekly feedings of either brine shrimp or micro-plankton.  As with most other corals the Candy Cane coral will also benefit from the addition of calcium, strontium, and other trace elements to the water.

10 Carnation Tree Coral Dendronephthya sp. The Carnation Tree Coral or as it is often commonly known as, the Dendronephthya Carnation, Cauliflower Soft Coral or Strawberry Soft Coral is both a very attractive coral and also very peaceful in nature. This species can differ in appearance quite a bit with over 250 different identified Dendronephthya species, but is is often found in a variety of flamboyant colors, with red, pink and orange being the most common. It is normally sold attached to a small piece of live rock or coral rubble, which can then be placed within the reef aquarium pretty much any location that has low lighting and strong water current.  The Carnation Tree Coral requires excellent water conditions with very low nitrate and phosphate levels; as well as, frequent feedings of phytoplankton based foods.  This combination is difficult to achieve for most hobbyists, which makes this species the domain of the expert hobbyist.
<p>
While its requirements of low lighting and medium to strong water movement is not unusual, what makes the Carnation Tree Coral difficult to keep is its feeding requirements. It is necessary to have a constant current with an abundance of phytoplankton within, so that the Carnation Tree Coral can be supplied with the necessary nutrition. Unlike many other species the Carnation Tree Coral does not contain symbiotic algae zooxanthellae, thus it needs to get all of its nutrition from micro-foods that it catches from the water currents. This makes it difficult to maintain in the reef aquarium, and should only be housed in an established reef aquarium, by an advanced marine aquarium hobbyist. For continued good health, it will also require the addition of strontium, iodine, and other trace elements to the water.
<p>
The Carnation Tree Corals requirements of multiple feedings of meaty foods per day and excellent water quality consisting of very low nitrates and phosphates makes them difficult to keep in many aquarium setups.  Larger established reef aquariums with plenty of live sand and live rock are ideal for keeping NPS Corals as they are able to both provide the necessary food sources for filter feeding corals and provide excellent water quality.  The large amount of de-nitrification provided by the bacteria living on the live rock/sand is critical for keeping sensitive coral species, as they fully breakdown waste within the aquarium without producing high levels of nitrates.  Protein skimmers are also critical in NPS Coral setups as they remove waste products before they have a chance to break down.  It is important to not introduce phosphate, nitrate or silicate via water changes or top-off water, thus a RO/DI unit should be used for all water being introduced into the NPS Coral reef aquarium.
<p>
The Carnation Tree Coral does not contain the symbiotic algae zooxanthellae; therefore, its diet must include meaty foods delivered either by the water currents or a pipette.  Ideally they should be able to filter feed on nutrient rich waters containing phytoplankton and photosynthesizing microscopic organisms that are found inhabiting the upper sunlit areas of the ocean.  Only hobbyists with large mature reef systems will be able to sustain enough phytoplankton to meet the needs of NPS Corals.  Hobbyists with smaller or less established aquariums will need to feed their NPS Corals foods designed for filter feeding invertebrates.  Suitable foods include: cyclop-eeze, baby brine shrimp, plankton and phytoplankton based food designed for corals.  These micro-foods must also be available often within the water currents, so that the Carnation Tree Coral can feed many times each day. Only expert reef aquarium hobbyists with mature reef systems will have success keeping this coral due to its rather stringent feeding and pristine water requirements.

1 Acei Cichlid Pseudotropheus sp. <b>Native Habitat and Species Information</b>
<p>
Pseudotropheus Acei are typically found on the Northwestern areas of Lake Malawi in Zambia, Africa. Their bright blue and yellow coloration and interesting banded markings on both their fins and body have made them a long time favorite of African Cichlid enthusiasts. Pseudotropheus Acei tends to become highly aggressive towards the same species when they do not have sufficient space to claim a suitable territory, but are otherwise considered to be fairly peaceful. However, many hobbyists have great success with crowding African Cichlids, which means that no one individual can establish their own territory. This essentially creates a balance within the aquarium and spreads any aggression from dominant specimens amongst many tank mates, which keeps any one fish from being stressed to death. Overall there is little to differentiate a male Acei Cichlid from a female, other than the males bearing egg spots on the back edge of the anal fin. Overall the Pseudotropheus Acei is a popular species and definitely worth a chance for beginners and advanced hobbyists alike. They are generally easy to find at local and online retailers and sell for very reasonable prices.
<p>
<b>Aquarium Care</b>
<p>
Pseudotropheus Acei will do best when housed in an aquarium of 75 gallons or more, and are provided with a fine sand substrate, multiple rocky formations or along with moderate water flow and small amounts of vegitation, that will simulate their natural environment. They prefer open space and should be provided with enough room to swim around freely. They should be fine with live plants, but have been known to eat them sometimes in their diet. Pseudotropheus Acei are normally fine with tank mates that do not share their appearance or species, but they should be similar in size and disposition. A larger tank, 6 foot long or more, will be needed if another male Pseudotropheus Acei is ever planned as a new addition, unless the tank is crowded with specimens and no one dominant male is able to establish his own territory.
<p>
<b>Feeding & Nutrition</b>
<p>
Acei Cichlid are herbivores who in their native habitat feed primarily on algae covered rocks and submerged wood. They are also known to graze on multiple types of aquatic vegitation, thus making them not as well suited as most African Cichlids for a planted aquarium environment. However, they should be fine with tougher plants like Java Ferns or many Anubias plant species. Hobbyists typically provide Acei Cichlids with a quality herbivore flake or pellet food, along with supplemental algae wafers and of course naturally occuring algae growth on the rock and wood aquarium decor.
<p>
<b>Breeding Information</b>
<p>
For hobbyists looking to breed Acei Cichlid, they will more quickly facilitate spawning by keeping a single male specimen with at least three females. Pseudotropheus Acei are maternal mouthbrooders, with the female cichlid laying her eggs and immediately gathering them up in her mouth. The female will then be attracted to the egg-like spots on the males anal fin, thinking that they are more eggs to gather up in her mouth; she will then try to gather and will receive sperm from the male, thus fertilizing the eggs. The female will carry the eggs (usually a clutch of 25-50) for around 25 days before she releases free-swimming fry. The fry can then be fed newly hatched brine shrimp, Artemia nauplii, daphnia, or crushed flake food. 7 Aggressive 70 Lake Malawi Moderate 72-82&deg;&nbsp;F, pH 8.0-9.0, KH 9-19 Herbivore Cichlidae Cichlid-African African Cichlid 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/cichlid-AceiCichlid.jpg empty Acei Cichlid /images/fish_freshwater/african_AceiCichlid1.jpg Acei Cichlid /images/fish_freshwater/african_AceiCichlid2.jpg Acei Cichlid /images/fish_freshwater/african_AceiCichlid3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/african_AceiCichlid4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=26
2 Neon Tetra Paracheirodon innesi Neon Tetras originate from the streams and flooded woodlands of South America.  They are a relatively small fish, but are very impressive when kept in medium to large schools.  When kept in a good sized school, their bright colors and darting swimming motion are truly impressive to watch.  Neons do very well in most community tropical freshwater aquariums, where their tankmates are of similar calm disposition and are not large enough to see the Neon as food.

5 Tiger Barb Puntius tetrazona The Tiger Barb is a tropical freshwater fish species found commonly throughout southeast Asia. This species is found living in a variety of natural tropical settings including clear shallow waters, turbid flowing streams and shallow murky waters. Due to this variety of settings, the Tiger Barb has developed a wide tolerance to many varied water conditions. They will do well in an aquarium setup with warm tropical waters ranging from 75 to 82°F, with a pH of 6.0-8.0, a water hardness of 5-19 dGH, and either calm water or moderately turbid water currents. Tiger Barbs do not grow too large, attaining a maximum size of about 3 inches in length. They have unique coloration of silver to brownish/yellow on their body with four vertical black stripes and red coloration on their fins and snout. With their attractive coloration and pattern, wide tolerance for various aquarium conditions and relatively long life span of 5 to 7 years, the Tiger Barb has become an aquarium hobbyist favorite and can be found in practically all aquarium pet stores.
<p>
In the aquarium environment the Tiger Barb is an active brightly colored species that will generally be found swimming at lower and mid levels of the aquarium. They have a reputation as being fin nippers; however, this reputation is somewhat unfair as barbs in general exhibit this as part of their natural behavior. It is important to keep Tiger Barbs in groups of 4 or more, so that they can swim as a group and nip at each other instead of other aquarium species. Tiger Barbs will not injure each other with this behavior as it is something barb do amongst themselves and are well equipped for this type of behavior. The nipping only becomes a problem when Tiger Barbs are kept singularly or in too small of numbers (less than four) that they may nip at others in the aquarium who can have their fins injured by this behavior. Tiger Barbs will do best in aquariums that are brightly lit with a good amount of vegetation and some moderate water currents. While they can be kept with all but the most shy of species, they are well suited to coexist well with other boisterous species like loaches, catfish, danios and other species of barbs. Ultimately, the key to successfully owning this barb species is to keep them in good sized groups (6 plus members) and provide them with plenty of mid-level plants and driftwood that they can playfully swim about.
<p>
Tiger Barbs are true omnivores and will readily accept a variety of flake, crisp, freeze-dried, frozen or live foods. A typical tropical species staple flake will satisfy their complete nutritional needs; however, they can be offered bloodworms, brine or other similar foodstuffs to give them some variety in their diet.
<p>
Tiger Barbs usually attain sexual maturity at around 1.5 inches in total length, or approximately 2 months of age. The females are larger with a more rounded stomach and a mainly black dorsal fin while the males have a bright, red nose with a distinct red line above the black on their dorsal fin. As egg-layers, they tend to spawn several hundred eggs in a suitable area of plants, with around 300 eggs being the norm for a mature breeding population. The eggs are adhesive and will stay stuck to the plants where they were laid. Tiger Barbs will eat their own eggs, so it is important to remove the parents after spawning to prevent them from eating the eggs. 3 Semi-Aggressive 20 Southeast Asia Easy 75-82&deg; F, pH 6.0-8.0, KH 5-19 Omnivore Cyprinidae Community Barbs 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/community-TigerBarb.jpg empty /images/fish_freshwater/barb_tiger1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/barb_tiger2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/barb_tiger3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/barb_tiger4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=30
6 Odessa Barb Puntius padamya The Odessa Barb is a very colorful and boisterous barb species that while not the most common fish available at the local pet store it can be found from time to time.  It is worth the wait to obtain some of these delightful fish as they will bring unmatched color and movement to any tropical community freshwater aquarium.  Odessa Barbs originate from Southeast Asia where they live in a variety of tropical waters with varying water chemistry.  They are a relatively long lived species that can commonly live for 5 years in a well maintained aquarium.  This flexibility helps make the Odessa Barb an excellent specimen for the freshwater aquarium hobbyist.
<p>
As with most barb species, it is very important to keep this species in groups of 6 or more.  Although the Odessa Barb is not known to be overly aggressive towards other tankmate species, they will truly thrive when kept with a group of their own kind that they can playfully chase and nip at each other.  When kept in a group, this species will gladly ignore other more slow moving or long finned species in the aquarium such as gouramis, angels or Betta in turn sticking with their own kind.  An ideal tank for this species would be a long moderately planted tropical aquarium with warmer water temperatures and plenty of space for this active fast swimming species.
<p>
Odessa Barbs are very easy to take care of as they are tolerant of a range of aquarium conditions and will eat any type of tropical freshwater flake, pellet, frozen or live foods.
<p>
Males of this species have a very pronounced wide red stripe that runs from their head to the caudal fin, with very defined black outlined abdominal scales.  Females do not have the red stripe and have bodies that are more grayish in color with less prominent black markings on the body and outlining the scales.  Both sexes possess a vertically elongate dark humeral blotch and a small, inconspicuous dark blotch on the side of the caudal peduncle. 3 Peaceful 20 Southeast Asia Easy 72-82&deg; F, pH 6.0-7.5, KH 6-16 Omnivore Cyprinidae Community Barbs 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/community-OdessaBarb.jpg 24 /images/fish_freshwater/barb_odessa1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/barb_odessa2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/barb_odessa3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/barb_odessa4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=31
8 Pearly Calvus Altolamprologus calvus Altolamprologus calvus (Pearly Calvus) have become very popular with African Cichlid owners as they have a slender aggressive body shape, steep sloping forehead with a large mouth and attractive coloration with stripes on the head and collar region and brilliant white spots on the posterior two-thirds of the their sides, all this combined with their easy going temperament make them a good choice for a variety of aquarium setups.  Pearly Calvus are known for being slow growers and can take over two years to reach their maximum size of 6 inches for males and 4 inches for females.  They are found in eastern parts of Lake Tanganyikan around rocky outcrops and other areas with plenty of rock caves and crevices.  There are several morphological varieties of Pearly Calvus including: black, white, yellow, and even zebra, which looks a lot like a white version of Alto. compressiceps.  Pearly Calvus make a great addition to most any Tanganyikan community setup, except for setups with much smaller fishes or shellfish, as these would most likely become a meal.  They can also be kept 
with many of the fishes from Lakes Malawi and Victoria, provided the latter also require a high protein diet.
<p>
Pearly Calvus require an aquarium with plenty of rocks forming caves and rock ledges and crevices.  When initially added to the aquarium, it is not unusual for this species to hide in the rocks most of the time.  However, over time they will adapt to their new environment and spend most of their time in the lower areas of the aquarium along the substrate and lower rocky areas.  It is important to not overfeed the aquarium during this period trying to get food to the Calvus, they will emerge from their rock cave when they are ready and will begin eating hardily at that time.  This mimics there behavior in the wild where they spend their time along the substrate looking for shellfish and other foodstuffs to scoop up from the ground or from within rock caves.  Pearly Calvus are quite peaceful in the aquarium and will not fight with other fish species including similar sized species as well.  While they have a good temperament for a community cichlid aquarium, they are very capable of defending themselves and will use their thick scales as both a strong defense and for inflicting damage on their attacker.  Unlike many other African Cichlid species, Pearly Calvus are not territorial and will coexist with other species or others of their own kind.
<p>
Pearly Calvus are hardy eaters (once established) and will readily take most any type of high-protein meaty foods including: brine shrimp, meaty pellets, cichlid flakes and live foods.  They will also consume fish species that are much smaller than themselves and will eat shellfish and crustaceans.
<p>
Pearly Calvus are substrate spawners and it is not uncommon to miss that they have spawned as they are very secretive spawners.  Calvus like to spawn in tight confines such as a rocky cave, deep rocky crevice, rock overhang, inside a shell or pot or any suitable area that the male of the species cannot enter.  The male will release his milt at the entrance of the females spawning location and both the male and female will use their fins to fan the milt onto the eggs, which will be dropped on the substrate.  A typical spawn for a younger pair will number 75 eggs while a mature breeding pair will number around 200 eggs, with females being able to spawn every 30 to 40 days.  The fry are very slow growers and will need upwards of 9 months to reach approximately 1 inch in size, the male young will be about 1/3rd larger than the females.  While it is possible to raise the fry in the parent aquarium, the survival rate will be increased drastically if the fry are moved to a grow-out tank with a seasoned sponge filter.  The fry calvus are bottom huggers, thus for this reason, you will need to pay extra attention to water quality as extra food can quickly foul the substrate.  A mixture of Cyclops-eeze, Hikari First Start, and finely ground earthworm and brine shrimp flakes should provide the necessary nutrition with as little excess as possible.  Partial weekly water changes will help insure that proper water conditions are maintained. 6 Semi-Aggressive 20 Lake Tanganyika Easy 75-80&deg; F, pH 7.8-9.0, GH 12-20, KH 14-20 Carnivore Cichlidae Cichlid-African African Cichlid 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/cichlid-PearlyCalvus.jpg empty /images/fish_freshwater/altolamprologusCalvus1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/altolamprologusCalvus2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/altolamprologusCalvus3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/altolamprologusCalvus4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=32
9 Zebra Obliquidens Astatotilapia latifasciata The Zebra Obliquidens (Astatotilapia latifasciata) is a popular Lake Victoria species of African Cichlid, that is popular within the aquarium hobby due to its colorful appearance and peaceful disposition.  This species is also bread heavily in the aquarium trade as it is heavily threatened in the wild and may be nearing extinction.  While the females of the species are attractive in their own right, they lack the bursts of red and yellow that the males posses.  It is the bursts of red and yellow on the belly of the fish with the vertical black bars over top a silver body that makes this fish very distinguishable amongst its peers.  
<p>
Zebra Obliquidens are a dream species for the aquarium hobby as they are very easy to care for and can easily get along well with other fish species.  They prefer neutral to moderately hard water conditions, with regular partial water changes or the presence of a high-end filtration system.  It is important to provide plenty of rocky hiding places in order to provide this species with a sense of security and a place to retreat to when it feels threatened.  It may become aggressive towards others if it is not provided with plenty of caves and crevices as it will feel the need to fight over what little cover is provided.  Male Zebra Obliquidens typically get about 5 inches in length, with females reaching about 4 inches in length.  While this species is a very suitable candidate for a community African Cichlid aquarium, they should not be kept with species that are much larger or overly aggressive species.
<p>
Zebra Obliquidens are omnivores (eating primarily the diet of an insectivore), thus they will eat a variety of foods ranging from plankton and insects to more meaty foods including: krill, mysis shrimp, daphnia, chichlid flake, cichlid pellets and other meaty (protein rich) preparations.  This species is a hardy eater, that should be fed multiple times a day a diet that is rich in protein and as varied as possible, in order to provide balanced nutrition and promote a healthy immune system.
<p>
Zebra Obliquidens are prolific spawners that are easily bread within the aquarium environment.  They will require a good sized aquarium of 125 gallons or greater, along with flat rocks or slate on which to lay their eggs.  The females of the species will actually guard the fry for approximately 2 months after they are born, which means that the fry can be raised in the same aquarium as the parents.  They should begin feeding almost immediately on baby brine shrimp or similar preparations and will grow quickly, reaching their distinctive shape and form in about a week. 5 Peaceful 45 Lake Victoria Easy 75-82&deg; F, pH 7.0-8.5, KH 10-25 Omnivore (insectivore) Cichlidae Cichlid-African African Cichlid 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/cichlid-ZebraObliquidens.jpg empty /images/fish_freshwater/astatotilapiaLatifasciata1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/astatotilapiaLatifasciata2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/astatotilapiaLatifasciata3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/astatotilapiaLatifasciata4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=33
10 Blue Gourami Trichogaster trichopterus Blue Gourami are an attractive Southeast Asian community species that is widely available within the aquarium hobby trade.  They have been a very popular species ever since their introduction into the hobby, due to a mix of attractive colors, interesting body shape, swimming habits and peaceful demeanor, Blue Gourami are at home in pretty much any tropical freshwater community aquarium.  While always an attractive fish, their coloration and pattern can change based on their mood and their surroundings, at times being a deep blue with a well defined pattern  all the way to a pale blue with a very faint color pattern.  Like many fish species the Blue Gourami goes by multiple names including: Opaline Gourami and Three-Spot Gourami, for the two spots on their body and their eye being the third spot as it is lined up nicely with the other two.  Blue Gouramis also possess a labyrinth organ, which allows them to breath air directly, which comes in handy in their natural environment as they often live in shallow water with low oxygen levels.
<p>
Blue Gourami are a very hardy species that is very tolerant of water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen levels and KH.  They prefer aquariums that have plenty of dense live plants with calm or moderate water currents.  Blue Gourami will spend most of their time near the surface of the aquarium, but will seek cover in plants of near driftwood if they feel threatened.  The males of the species are very territorial and should only be kept with multiple females; however, if the aquarium is very large (125 gallon plus) a group of 6 or more Gourami can be kept together and the combination of tank size and fish group size will reduce their natural territorial aggression. 
<p>
Blue Goruamis are an exceptionally easy fish to feed, as they will accept virtually any meaty foods ranging from flake or freeze-dried, to live foods, such as bloodworms, brine shrimp or krill.  They will also consume hydra voraciously, and are prized for their ability to eliminate this pest from the home aquarium.
<p>
Blue Gouramis tolerate a wide range of temperatures and are not demanding in terms of water conditions, but they prefer soft, slightly acidic water when in breeding season.  Males have a long, pointed dorsal fin, while the females dorsal fin is shorter and more rounded.  Because the male can be rather aggressive during spawning, the aquarium habitat should provide plenty of places for the female to take refuge, this is important as the female will need to seek refuge from an overanxious male in order to avoid fin damage and stress.  
<p>
 Just before the sperm are released, the pair may be observed quivering, which is a sure sign that spawning is near completion.  The eggs are released immediately thereafter, and are fertilized by the time they reach the bubble nest created earlier by the male fish.  The pair may repeat the process a number of times over the course of several hours.  It is not unusual for the number of eggs produced to reach into the thousands.   
<p>
Once spawning is complete, the female's involvement is over, and she should be removed to prevent her from being attacked by the male. From this point forward until they hatch, the male will tend the eggs, carefully rearranging them and returning any errant eggs back to the nest.  The eggs hatch in approximately 30 hours.  The fry should be moved to a grow out tank with a sponge covered bubble filter, so that the young fish are not sucked into the filtration and killed.  It is important that the fry be fed small foodstuffs, such as baby brine shrimp, infusoria or nauplii.  The aquarium housing the fry should have frequent water changes during their growth as the water can become fouled quickly. 4 Peaceful 20 Southeast Asia Easy 72-82&deg; F, pH 6.0-7.5, KH 5-28 Omnivore Belontiidae Community Gouramis 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/community-BlueGourami.jpg 23 /images/fish_freshwater/blueGourami1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/blueGourami2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/blueGourami3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/blueGourami4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=34
11 Bala Shark Balantiocheilus melanopterus Like most fish found in the aquarium hobby the Bala Shark goes by a variety of common names including: Tri-Color Shark, Silver Shark and of course <a href="http://www.rolexreplicait.it/categorie/rolex/">replica rolex</a> the Bala Shark named after its scientific name.  Despite their large adult size, Bala Shark are most commonly kept in standard community aquariums where they will happily coexist with a variety of other community fish species. <a href="http://www.replicaderelojesdelujo.com/category/rolex/">rolex daytona replica</a>  While not aggressive, they can be a problem if kept with very small fish species or if not given enough room to swim, as they are active swimmers.  Adult specimens are also kept with larger, semi-aggressive fish species as they are usually able to hold their own once they have reached adult sizes of 1 foot or more.  They make a great addition to medium to large aquariums where a small group of them can be kept successfully, swimming about all day providing a lot of activity within the aquarium and providing a bright silver color contrast to other less metallic fish species.
<p>
Despite their large adult size, Bala Sharks like to swim <a href="https://www.orologireplicait.net/categorie/omega/">omega replica</a> in schools both in a natural setting and within an aquarium environment, thus it is best to keep them in small groups of 3 to 6 specimens.  It is important to keep in mind that as adults they can reach approximately 1 1/2 feet in length, so they should only be kept in large to very large aquariums.  Will not particularly aggressive, Bala Sharks can pose a hazard to much smaller fish species like Neon Tetras, as they have been known to eat small fish.  Bala Sharks prefer aquarium setups that have a good mixture of open swimming areas and dense vegetation or vertically oriented drift wood.  An ideal setup for this species would contain lots of live plants, driftwood and open areas to swim, with a low to moderate current and tank mates that will tolerate the Bala Sharks active nature.
<p>
Bala Sharks are omnivores and thus will eat a wide variety of plant based or meaty food preparations.  On top of being an omnivore, Bala Sharks are simply just not picky eaters as they will readily consume a wide variety of foodstuffs including: flaked foods, freeze-dried, vegetable or plant matter, frozen foods, bloodworms, tubifex worms and much more.  It is best to feed them a 2 to 3 times per day amounts that they will consume within a minute or two. 16 Semi-Aggressive 75 Southeast Asia Moderate 70-82° F, pH 6.0-7.5, KH 10-15 Omnivore Cyprinidae Community Sharks 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/community-BalaShark.jpg 61 /images/fish_freshwater/shark_bala1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/shark_bala2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/shark_bala3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/shark_bala4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=35
92 Cherry Barb Puntius titteya The Cherry Barb (Puntius titteya) is a tropical community species endemic to the lakes and river basins of Sri Lanka.  Their name comes from the red coloration of the male, that obtains a vibrant cherry red color that they use to attract females of the species.  Female Cherry Barbs are more brownish/tan in color, but still have an attractive stripe that runs the length of their body.  Females are larger and more plump than the males, who have a more stream lined body shape and brighter coloration.  In the wild, Cherry Barbs are found in shady areas of thick vegetation or amongst tree roots, where they hunt for food and stay protected from larger fish species that cannot easily maneuver in the dense vegetation.
<p>
Cherry Barbs should be housed in peaceful tropical community aquariums that contain plenty of plants, driftwood and root structures in order to provide them an environment that emulates their natural habitat.  They are a peaceful and somewhat shy species that depend heavily on dense vegetation to afford them a sense of security when kept with other larger and more boisterous community species.  An ideal aquarium setup would contain a sandy or fine substrate with a mix of densely planted areas, branch type driftwood,  tree root and open swimming areas.  Cherry Barbs should be house with other peaceful community fish and/or semi-aggressive community fish not large enough to eat them.  If kept with semi-aggressive species like Angelfish and Gourami, it is important to provide plenty of dense foliage and tree root to provide the Cherry Barb with plenty of protected areas.
<p>
Breeding Cherry Barbs is a fairly straight forward process that generally only requires a small aquarium (10 gallons), some plants or similar decorations and a mated pair or a single male with a group of females.  Place the male/female pair or male and female fish into the planted breeding aquarium.  When the male is ready to breed, he will begin chasing the females about the tank, which will stimulate them to lay their eggs amongst the leaves of the plants.  The male will then fertilize the eggs, after which they will hatch within 2 to 3 days.  The parents should be removed from the aquarium after the eggs are laid and fertilized so that they do not eat the eggs or hatched fry.  Fry can be fed commercial foods specifically designed for fish fry, then moved to crushed flake food as they grow.  Lastly, be sure to cover all filter intakes with sponges to prevent the fry from being sucked into the filter.
<p>
In their natural habitat, Cherry Barbs consume both vegetable and meaty foods ranging from plant matter to insects and small worms.  Omnivores like the Cherry Barb should be fed a varied diet containing both plant and meaty foods in order to provide them all the nutrients that they need to support a healthy immune system and slime coat.  Hobbyists should feed the Cherry Barb a quality flake food designed for tropical omnivores mixed with algae or plant based flaked foods.  In addition to quality flaked foods, Cherry Barbs should be offered quality frozen foods, blood worms, tubifex worms, brine shrimp and similar fair to mix up their diet and provide them a wide range of nutritional foodstuffs.  They should be fed 2 to 3 times per day an amount of food that will consume within a few minutes. 2 Peaceful 20 Sri Lanka Easy 74-80&deg; F, KH 4-18, pH 6.0-7.5 Omnivore Cyprinidae Community Barbs 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/community-CherryBarb.jpg empty /images/fish_freshwater/cherryBarb1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/cherryBarb2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/cherryBarb3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/cherryBarb4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=670
93 Denison Barb Barbus denisonii Denison Barb's originate from India where they can be found living in fast flowing streams, rivers  and tributaries of the southern part of the country.  They are a shoaling species that groups in large numbers for protection from larger predatory species.  They are also fast swimmers that use rapid acceleration and jumping from the water to avoid attacks from larger predatory fish species.  Denison Barb's are commonly sold within the aquarium hobby by a variety of common names including: Denison Barb, Rose Line Shark and the Red Lined Torpedo Barb.  As with most fish species that originate from fast flowing rivers and streams the Denison Barb is designed to swim very rapidly, thus they need larger (longer) aquariums than other fish species their size.  They also require the aquarium to be fully covered as they have a natural instinct to jump from the water as an escape mechanism when they feel threatened.
<p>
Denison Barb's require larger aquariums than most tropical community species their size, as they are very active swimmers and need plenty of room to dart about the aquarium.  As they originate from fast flowing streams and rivers, they are used to high levels of dissolved oxygen in the water and very high quality water conditions.  It is important to provide them with plenty of water flow and oxygen through the use of additional power heads or pumps that agitate the water's surface, which will increase the levels of oxygen in the water.  While it is possible to keep a single specimen or a pair of Denison Barb's, it is better to keep a group ( 4 or more) as this will help replicate how they live in the wild.  They do very well with other similar sized tropical community species and can be kept with a wide variety of peaceful and semi-aggressive tropical community fish species.  In addition to sufficient water flow, the Denison Barb will also appreciate an aquarium with plenty of plants that it can swim amongst and retreat to when threatened.  Lastly, aquariums housing Denison Barb's should be fully covered as they are well known for jumping out of un-covered aquariums.
<p>
In the wild the Denison Barb will consume a mix of plant and animal based foods.  In order to provide them with a balanced nutritional diet, the aquarium hobbyist should make sure that they have a mixture of plant, algae and meaty foods in their diet.  They are not picky eaters and will readily consume a large variety of commercially available foods including: high quality flake and pellet foods, frozen foods, freeze-dried worms, bloodworms, tubifex worms, brine shrimp and other similar foodstuffs. 5 Peaceful 55 India Easy 62-78&deg; F, KH 4-10, pH 6.8-7.8 Omnivore Cyprinidae Community Barbs 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/community-DenisonBarb.jpg 58 /images/fish_freshwater/denisonBarb1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/denisonBarb2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/denisonBarb3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/denisonBarb4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=671
94 Green Tiger Barb Puntius tetrazona Green Tiger Barbs are a selectively bred variant of the Tiger Barb, that through years of selective breeding have brought out the naturally occurring green coloration and accentuated it.  The body of the Green Tiger Barb has medium to large areas of green coloration that varies from a medium to dark green in color.  In the wild Tiger Barbs are found living in a variety of natural tropical settings including clear shallow waters, turbid flowing streams and shallow murky waters. Due to this variety of settings, the Tiger Barb has developed a wide tolerance to many varied water conditions. They will do well in an aquarium setup with warm tropical waters, with a pH of 6.0-8.0, a water hardness of 5-19 dGH, and either calm water or moderately turbid water currents. Green Tiger Barbs do not grow too large, attaining a maximum size of about 3 inches in length.  With their attractive coloration and pattern, wide tolerance for various aquarium conditions and relatively long life span of 5 to 7 years, the Green Tiger Barb has become an aquarium hobbyist favorite and can be found in practically all aquarium pet stores.
<p>
In the aquarium environment the Green Tiger Barb is an active brightly colored species that will generally be found swimming at lower and mid levels of the aquarium. They have a reputation as being fin nippers; however, this reputation is somewhat unfair as barbs in general exhibit this as part of their natural behavior. It is important to keep Green Tiger Barbs in groups of 4 or more, so that they can swim as a group and nip at each other instead of other aquarium species. Green Tiger Barbs will not injure each other with this behavior as it is something barb do amongst themselves and are well equipped for this type of behavior. The nipping only becomes a problem when Green Tiger Barbs are kept singularly or in too small of numbers (less than four) that they may nip at others in the aquarium who can have their fins injured by this behavior. Green Tiger Barbs will do best in aquariums that are brightly lit with a good amount of vegetation and some moderate water currents. While they can be kept with all but the most shy of species, they are well suited to coexist well with other boisterous species like loaches, catfish, danios and other species of barbs. Ultimately, the key to successfully owning this barb species is to keep them in good sized groups (6 plus members) and provide them with plenty of mid-level plants and driftwood that they can playfully swim about.
<p>
Green Tiger Barbs are true omnivores and will readily accept a variety of flake, crisp, freeze-dried, frozen or live foods. A typical tropical species staple flake will satisfy their complete nutritional needs; however, they can be offered bloodworms, brine or other similar foodstuffs to give them some variety in their diet.
<p>
Green Tiger Barbs usually attain sexual maturity at around 1.5 inches in total length, or approximately 2 months of age. The females are larger with a more rounded stomach and a mainly black dorsal fin while the males have a bright, red nose with a distinct red line above the black on their dorsal fin. As egg-layers, they tend to spawn several hundred eggs in a suitable area of plants, with around 300 eggs being the norm for a mature breeding population. The eggs are adhesive and will stay stuck to the plants where they were laid. Green Tiger Barbs will eat their own eggs, so it is important to remove the parents after spawning to prevent them from eating the eggs.  As they are a selectively bred variant, they will need to be bred with other Green Tiger Barbs to continue to exhibit strong green coloration on their bodies. 3 Semi-aggressive 20 Southeast Asia Easy 75-82&deg; F, KH 5-19, pH 6.0-7.8 Omnivore Cyprinidae Community Barbs 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/community-GreenTigerBarb.jpg empty /images/fish_freshwater/greenTigerBarb1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/greenTigerBarb2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/greenTigerBarb3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/greenTigerBarb4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=672
95 Chinese Algae Eater Gyrinocheilos aymonieri The Chinese Algae Eater has been a popular aquarium fish for a long time, as they have been kept in tropical community aquariums for some time.  Hobbyist's initially purchase the Chinese Algae Eater for it's ability to keep algae under control, but soon find them to be both a useful and interesting fish to keep.  Their unique swimming style combined with their ability to perch on rocks, plants, driftwood, etc. make them entertaining to watch.  If kept in groups, a single specimen will generally become dominant over the others and attain a much larger size then the other Chinese Algae Eaters kept in the same tank.  While this is a breeding adaptation seen in many fish species, little is known about this species breeding requirements and habits.
<p>
Aquariums housing Chinese Algae Eater's should have plenty of rocks, driftwood and plants for the fish to graze on for algae.  Chinese Algae Eater's can reach upwards of 10" when fully grown and can swim very quickly in short burst, thus they should be housed in aquariums of 30 gallons or more to give them the room they need.  They can be semi-aggressive towards others of their own kind, but tend to leave other fish only.  Even when they chase other sucker mouth fish, they are not overly aggressive and typically only squabble with other similar fish species over territory.  Ideally they should be provided shaded areas within the aquarium, as they tend to like to avoid the bright aquarium lights at times.
<p>
Chinese Algae Eater's are herbivores that primarily eat algae growing on rocks, plants, driftwood and aquarium glass.  They are excellent for planted aquariums as they can eat algae growing on live plants without damaging the plant itself.  Other larger algae eaters like Pleco's can be damaging to live plants due to their size and weight.  If enough naturally occurring algae is not present within the aquarium, Chinese Algae Eater's can also be fed sinking algae wafers and pellets. 10 Semi-Aggressive 30 Southeast Asia Easy 74-81&deg; F, KH 8-10, pH 6.8-7.4 Herbivore Gyrinocheilidae Community Suckermouth Catfish 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/community-ChineseAlgae.jpg empty /images/fish_freshwater/chineseAlgaeEater1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/chineseAlgaeEater2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/chineseAlgaeEater3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/chineseAlgaeEater4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=694
96 Galaxy Pleco Leporacanthicus galaxias Galaxy Pleco's originate from the Amazon basin, where they can be found living along the bottom of the many streams, tributaries and flood plains.  They spend the majority of their time searching the growth along the river bottom for decaying plant matter, algae and small meaty items.  They typically avoid the brightness of the midday sun by hiding under plants or driftwood, then come out at night to forage.  The Galaxy Pleco is a very peaceful species that will get along well with tropical community fish and cichlids.  They will squabble with other similar sized Pleco's and bottom feeders if not given enough room to establish a suitable territory.  These territorial battles tend not to be too violent; however, they should be house in an aquarium larger than 55 gallons if they are to be kept with other Pleco's or similar species.
<p>
The streams and tributaries of the Amazon from which the Galaxy Pleco originates have relatively strong water currents and large amounts of dissolved oxygen within the water.  Galaxy Pleco's will appreciate an aquarium that has plenty of water current and high levels of dissolved oxygen within the water.  They should also be provided with plants, driftwood and rocky caves in order to give them plenty of places to find cover and look for algae growth.  It is important to provide them with shaded areas within the aquarium to allow them to retreat from the bright aquarium lights, thus some rock caves or driftwood are important aqua scaping elements for this species.  Galaxy Pleco's require good water conditions with stable temperature and pH.  They should be kept in aquariums of 55 gallons or larger in order to provide them enough room and to allow enough water volume to maintain quality stable water conditions.  The Galaxy Pleco is a peaceful species that can be housed with a wide variety of tropical community fish species and semi-aggressive cichlid species.
<p>
Galaxy Pleco's are omnivores that will eat a large variety of foods ranging from algae and decaying plant matter to sinking meaty foods or foodstuffs that find their way to the aquarium substrate.  They are not picky about what they will eat, but should be offered a varied diet containing plenty of algae and plant material, along with some meaty based foods.  In a mature aquarium, the bulk of the Galaxy Pleco's diet can come from scavenging the aquarium substrate for excess food and from eating algae.  If enough food is not available to scavenge, their diet should be supplemented with sinking pellet foods or algae wafers. 8 Peaceful 55 South America Easy 72-79&deg; F, KH 8-12, pH 6.0-7.5 Omnivore Loricariidae Community Plecos 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/community-GalaxyPleco.jpg empty /images/fish_freshwater/galaxyPleco1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/galaxyPleco2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/galaxyPleco3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/galaxyPleco4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=731
97 Bumblebee Cichlid Pseudotropheus crabro Bumblebee Cichlid's or Crabro Cichlids originate from Lake Malawi, where they are found in deeper waters live in caves or near large rocky formations.  The Bumblebee Cichlid shares these caves with the Kampango Catfish, which is a large aggressive species.  The two species have a partial symbiotic relationship in that the Bumblebee Cichlid will eat parasites off of the Kampango Catfish and in return the Kampango will not eat the Bumblebee Cichlid.  In the dark watery caves, the Kampango Catfish uses the lighter gold and brown/black barred pattern of the Bumblebee Cichlid to identify it and not treat it as prey.  However, the Bumblebee Cichlid can rapidly change their coloration to a very dark almost black coloration that they use to mimic the appearance of the Kampango in order to feed on their eggs during breeding season.  After feeding on the Kampango eggs, the Bumblebee Cichlid is quick to adjust it's coloration and pattern back to the gold and brown striped pattern so they can remain safe inside the cave with the larger catfish.  Bumblebee Cichlids must be aggressive in the wild in order to coexist in close quarters with other larger predators and steal eggs while doing it, so it is important to remember that they will also be very aggressive within the aquarium environment as well.  The Bumblebee Cichlid makes a great addition to aggressive African Cichlid aquariums and larger community African Cichlid aquariums provided that the habitat is properly designed and large enough to provide the necessary territories for the fish being housed.
<p>
When considering a Bumblebee Cichlid for your African Cichlid aquarium, the most important aspect to consider is the aggressiveness of the species.  They are easy to care for and do not have many specific needs when kept within an aquarium, but they are quite aggressive and will need to be housed with proper tank mates in a reasonably sized aquarium.  It is critical to consider this when choosing tank mates as the Bumblebee Cichlid will quickly dominate less aggressive species, which could very well mean killing them.  The best ways to mitigate this aggression is to keep them with other larger aggressive species, create aqua-scaping that provides a large variety of territories with plenty of caves, house them in large aquariums that will allow them to establish territory without taking over the entire aquarium and lastly, keeping them with many other aggressive species so that aggression is spread out amongst many fish.  Bumblebee's will appreciate an aquarium setup that has a sandy substrate and plenty of large rocky caves.  Quality biological, mechanical and chemical filtration along with partial water changes are critical to maintaining high water quality levels that mimic the water conditions of the Bumblebee Cichlids native rift lake home.
<p>
The omnivorous Bumblebee Cichlid is an aggressive feeder that in the wild scratches out an existence eating parasites, stealing and eating other fishes eggs and preying on a variety of meaty planktonic foods.  When kept in an aquarium environment the Bumblebee will readily accept a large variety of meaty foods including: cichlid flake, pellet, sticks, frozen and freeze-dried foods, blood worms, tubifex worms and other similar meaty foods.  Simply provide them some variety to their diet so that they receive balanced nutrition and the Bumblebee Cichlid will be more than satisfied with most any meaty fare. 8 Aggressive 75 Lake Malawi Easy 75-82&deg; F, KH 10-15, pH 7.5-8.5 Omnivore Cichlidae Cichlid-African African Cichlid 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/cichlid-BumblebeeCichlid.jpg empty /images/fish_freshwater/bumbleeBeeCichlid1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/bumbleeBeeCichlid2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/bumbleeBeeCichlid3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/bumbleeBeeCichlid4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=750
98 Boesemani Rainbow Melanotaenia boesemani Boesemani Rainbow fish originate from the heavily planted tropical waters of Southeast Asia, Thailand and surrounding islands.  They are a schooling species that does much better within the aquarium environment when they are kept in schools of at least 6 individuals or more.  Juvenile Boesemani Rainbows tend to have relatively dull colors that brighten and develop into a much more vivid coloration as an adult.  Male and females differ in coloration with the males exhibiting a blue and purple head that fades into an orange and yellow posterior, while adult females develop an intense silver coloration that extends the whole of their body.  Many aquarium keepers have found that keeping Rainbow fish in aquariums with darker substrate and plenty of live plants works to bring out the full intensity of the Boesemani Rainbow fishes coloration.  Another benefit of keeping this species in a school is that the males will compete with one another for the females in the group, which they do by exhibiting the brightest coloration that they can muster.
<p>
When housing Boesemani Rainbow's in the home aquarium it is important to provide them with a long (4 feet or larger) aquarium that has areas of plants and plenty of room for these active swimmers to move about.  They are also well known jumpers, thus their aquarium should be well covered in order to keep them from jumping out of the aquarium when startled.  Boesemani Rainbow are schooling fish and should be kept in groups (6 or more individuals) as they would live this way in the wild.  Keeping single individuals is likely to cause the fish a lot of stress which will lead to poor coloration and more than likely a shorter lifespan.  Another important aspect to keeping Boesemani Rainbow fish is to provide them with plenty of planted areas within the aquarium, which will simulate their natural habitat and provide them with cover when needed.  Like most all tropical species, the Boesemani Rainbow needs stable water conditions and good filtration and water aeration.
<p>
Boesemani Rainbow are an omnivorous species that will readily consume a wide variety of commercially available foods.  In order to provide them with all the nutrients and minerals that they need to maintain a healthy immune system, they should be fed foods that contain both meaty and plant based material.  A variety of flake, frozen and freeze-dried fish foods fed 2 to 3 times per day is ideal.  Boesemani Rainbow have relatively small mouths and throats, thus should be fed smaller foods that they can easily swallow.  Live or freeze-dried bloodworms are a great treat for a school of Boesemani Rainbow's to supplement their normal diet. 3 Peaceful 55 Southeast Asia, Thailand Easy 72-79&deg; F, KH 9-19, pH 7.0-8.0 Omnivore Melanotaeniidae Community Rainbowfish 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/community-BoesemaniRainbow.jpg empty /images/fish_freshwater/boesemaniRainbow1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/boesemaniRainbow2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/boesemaniRainbow3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/boesemaniRainbow4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=761
99 Rainbow Platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus Rainbow Platies have been available within the aquarium trade for a long time, during which they have become a favorite of beginning aquarium hobbyists due to their bright coloration and ease of care.  Rainbow Platyfish are commonly sold under a variety of names including: Topsail Platy, Southern Platy, Moonfish and Rainbow Platy.  They make a great addition to any community aquarium, but are especially sought after by beginning hobbyists as they are one of the more attractive of the the fish species recommended for beginning aquarium hobbyists.  The Rainbow Platyfish exhibits brilliant coloration including a yellow / orange about the head area that fades to red towards the tail fin, along with a high dorsal fin which extends half way to the tail fin.  Males are more brightly colored than the females, with females obtaining a larger size.
<p>
The Rainbow Platyfish is an ideal species for beginning aquarium hobbyists as they have very modest aquarium requirements and are tolerant of a variety of water parameters.  They will do well in aquariums that are 10 gallons or larger, with stable water conditions and modest filtration.  They prefer calm waters and plenty of plants and driftwood in which to swim in and around.  Rainbow Platies should be kept with hardy plants like anubias, java ferns or java moss if kept within a smaller aquarium, as they will eat the leaves of more delicate plant species.  If kept within larger aquariums that are well planted, the Rainbow Platy should not cause too much damage to delicate plant species as they will mostly eat prepared foods and only occasionally graze on plants and algae.  They do well with a wide variety of tank mates and can be kept with most any tropical community fish species and larger freshwater invertebrates that are too large to eat.
<p>
Rainbow Platyfish are an omnivorous species that eat a wide variety of foodstuffs in the wild ranging from plant matter to insects.  They will pick at algae and certain plant species found within the aquarium.  They should be fed a varied diet that contains quality prepared foods including: flake, freeze-dried and frozen.  Tubifex, bloodworms and brine shrimp can be fed as treats or mixed with a quality flake food.  Overall this species is not a picky eater and will readily consume a wide variety of foods. 2 Peaceful 10 Mexico, Guatemala, Northern Honduras Easy 68-78&deg; F, KH 10-25, pH 7.0-8.2 Omnivore Poeciliidae Community Platy 2012-04-14 21:04:03 empty /images/fish_freshwater/rainbowPlatyfish1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/rainbowPlatyfish2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/rainbowPlatyfish3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/rainbowPlatyfish4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=764
100 Serpae Tetra Hyphessobrycon callistus Serpae Tetra or Red Minor Serpae Tetras are a common schooling fish found throughout South American waters.  They are a popular species that has been imported for the aquarium trade for a long time.  Their attractive red coloration and distinctive black markings along with their hardy disposition have made them popular with freshwater community aquarium hobbyists.  They are generally considered a peaceful species, but will nip at fins a little bit if house singularly, thus it is best to keep them in small groups of 4 or more in smaller aquariums and larger schools in bigger aquariums capable of housing many fish.
<p>
Serpae Tetras do very well in a wide variety of tropical freshwater community aquarium setups, as they can be kept with a wide variety of tank mates and themselves have only modest aquarium requirements.  Since they are a schooling fish, they do best when kept in groups of at least 4 or more individuals.  They need clean and stable water conditions, but do not have any special requirements in regards to water parameters, lighting or water movement.  Their ideal aquarium environment would contain plenty of plants and driftwood along with low to medium water currents and medium lighting.  They also do best with tank mates that have peaceful or semi-aggressive dispositions.
<p>
Serpae Tetras will breed within the aquarium environment when provided with proper water conditions.  A breeding pair or male and small group of females should be placed into a small breeding aquarium of approximately 10 gallons of slightly acidic water 6.0 to 6.5, medium to low lighting,  with some plants, driftwood or similar aqua-scaping.  A power filter or internal bubble filter with sponge or foam covered intakes should be used so that the fry do not get sucked into the filtration.  After eggs have been laid and fertilized, the parents should be removed from the aquarium so that they do not eat the newly hatched fry.  The fry should be fed baby brine shrimp or crushed flake foods until they are large enough to move to regular foods.
<p>
Serpae Tetra are an omnivorous species that will readily accept a variety of flake, crisp, freeze-dried, frozen or live foods. A typical tropical species staple flake will satisfy their complete nutritional needs; however, they can be offered bloodworms, brine or other similar foodstuffs to give them some variety in their diet. 2 Peaceful 20 South America Easy 72-82&deg; F, KH 4-8, pH 6.0-7.5 Omnivore Characidae Community Tetras 2012-04-14 21:04:03 /images/community-SerpaeTetra.jpg 17 /images/fish_freshwater/serpaeTetra1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/serpaeTetra2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/serpaeTetra3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/serpaeTetra4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=865
101 Scissortail Rasbora Rasbora trilineata The Scissortail Rasbora is a schooling fish that originates from the tropical waterways and flood plains of Vietnam.  It is a long sleek quick fish species that use their speed along with large schools of individuals to evade larger predators.  Their speed also comes in handy when it comes to feeding, as they can catch small insects in the water and at the waters surface.  They make a very interesting aquarium species as they will school together and swim about the upper regions of the aquarium; as well as, swimming in and out of taller plant species and tall pieces of driftwood.  The Scissortail Rasbora also has a very bright iridescent silver sheen that sparkles as the bright aquarium lights reflect off of the fish as it swims.  Scissortail Rasbora add a lot of contrast to most community aquariums as they are fast top water swimmers, where as the majority of species kept are slower moving mid-water species.  Overall the Scissortail Rasbora makes a great addition to all but the smallest freshwater tropical community aquariums.
<p>
While Scissortail Rasbora do not have specific feeding or aquarium setup requirements, they do best when kept in groups of 4 or more individuals with plenty of horizontal swimming room.  They are very active swimmers that bring a lot of movement and energy to any tropical community aquarium.  They are peaceful towards other fish species and are quick enough to easily evade all but the most persistent bullies that they may encounter within the tropical community aquarium environment.  They should be housed in aquariums that are fully covered as they are well known jumpers that instinctively will take to the air when they are startled.  Scissortail Rasbora appreciate the presence of plants and driftwood, but also require plenty of open swimming area to feel most at home.  Darker substrates and medium plant density along with proper lighting will help to bring out the best coloration in this species, that are capable of exhibiting brilliant silver, gold and black colors.

2 Flame Angelfish Centropyge loriculus The Flame Angelfish makes a flashy addition to any aquarium, thus making it one of the most popular dwarf angel species within the marine aquarium hobby.  It requires a minimum of a 30 gallon tank with extensive live rock for both grazing and to provide adequate hiding places. The Flame Angelfish is prone to nip at stony and soft corals (sessile invertebrates) and clam mantles, thus it must be kept with some caution in a reef aquarium.  Compared to most pygmy angels the Flame is one of the least destructive in the reef environment; therefore, if you want to keep an Angelfish in your reef aquarium, the Flame is the best bet.  They adapt well to aquarium life, but should be kept in an established system and housed with dissimilar genera, like other pygmy angels (and most species in general) they do not get along well with others of their own species due to territorial battles that will erupt.  Of course large aquariums (100 gallons plus) can provide more territory thus limiting these battles (extensive rock work is required to provide the necessary territory.  The Flame Angel is hermaphroditic, thus making it very difficult to breed in an aquarium and has no distinguishable differences in color between male to female.
<p>
There are slight differences in both coloration and markings of this species based on the location of collection. Marshall Island Flames are more red in color, with thicker black bars running vertically down the body. Cook Island Flames are more orange in coloration with either small black bars, or only a few thin bars running vertically down the body. Christmas Island Flames are normally a red/orange coloration with thin black bars running vertically down the body.  It is important to note that these color descriptions are a general guideline, and please expect variation among each fish.
<p>
Like most species and especially pygmy angelfish the Flame Angelfish is territorial towards both other Flame Angelfish and other pygmy angelfish.  Extensive rock work, live rock or reef area is required to give the Flame a suitable environment in the aquarium.  The Flame Angelfish will spend most of it's time swimming in and out of the rock work picking at marine algaes and small coral polyps.  The Flame Angelfish is probably the least destructive pygmy angel to keep in a reef aquarium, but it should be kept with caution as it can nip at corals and polyps and may be damaging to some species of corals.    
<p>
The diet of the Flame Angel should include marine algae, spirulina, high-quality angelfish preparations, and other meaty items such as brine or krill. This species should be fed two to three times daily what the fish will consume within a minute or two.  Being an omnivore it is important to provide a balanced diet of algaes and meats to provide all the necessary vitamins and nutritional needs. 4 Semi-aggressive 30 With Caution Fiji Moderate 72-78&deg; F, dKH 8-12, sg 1.020-1.025, pH 8.1-8.4 Omnivore Pomacanthidae Reef Compatible nano_reef Angels (Dwarf) 2008-12-07 12:00:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/angelfish_flame.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/angel_flame.jpg empty Flame Angelfish /images/fish_marine/angel_flame1.jpg images/fish_marine/angel_flame2.jpg images/fish_marine/angel_flame3.jpg images/fish_marine/angel_flame4.jpg images/fish_marine/angel_flame5.jpg images/fish_marine/angel_flame6.jpg images/fish_marine/angel_flame7.jpg images/fish_marine/angel_flame8.jpg qdy6lsxPnBM http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=80
3 Coral Beauty Centropyge bispinosus The Coral Beauty is a relatively peaceful fish that does very little or no harm to invertebrates, although it may be inclined to occasionally pick at tubeworms, coral polyps and sessile invertebrates. It is generally resistant to disease and grows to a maximum of 4 inches, thus making a good species for beginning marine aquarium hobbyists.  It should be kept in a tank with plenty of rock work or large reef where it can browse on algae growing on the live rock. The caves and crevices provided by extensive rockwork will give the Coral Beauty many places to hide in making it feel more secure.  Like most fish, the availability of hiding places will give the fish confidence to swim boldly in the tank knowing that at the first site of danger a refuge is close at hand.  Of the dwarf angels the Coral Beauty is one of the more peaceful species lending it to be compatilble with other dwarf angel species provided the aquarium is large enough to provide adequate ranges for each dwarf angel. (reccommended 90 gallon plus aquarium)
<p>
The Coral Beauty requires a 30 gallon or larger tank with lots of hiding places and live rock for grazing. In a  reef environment, the Coral Beauty Angelfish is prone to nip at stony and soft corals (sessile invertebrates).  In smaller aquariums (less than 55 gallons) the Coral Beauty should not be kept with other dwarf angels, but will do fine with other species.  In a large aquarium (90 gallons plus) the Coral Beauty can often be kept successfully with other dwarf angels species, especially if they are introduced to the aquarium at the same time and there is suitable rock work to provide adequate territories for each angel.  Overall temperment of the Coral Beauty is peaceful.
<p>
The diet of the Coral Beauty should include Spirulina, marine algae, high-quality angelfish preparations, clam or frozen shrimp, and other meaty items such as brine or krill. This species should be fed two to three times daily what the fish will consume within a minute or two. 4 Semi-aggressive 30 With Caution Fiji, Indo-Pacific Easy 72-78&deg; F, dKH 8-12, sg 1.020-1.025, pH 8.1-8.4 Omnivore Pomacanthidae Reef Compatible nano_reef Angels (Dwarf) 2008-12-07 12:00:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/angelfish_coralbeauty.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/angel_coralBeauty.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/angel_coralBeauty1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_coralBeauty2.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_coralBeauty3.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_coralBeauty4.jpg o0Opi3dnOqM http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=81
4 True Percula Clownfish Amphiprion percula The True Percula Clownfish (Amphiprion percula) is possibly the most recognized and popular marine fish species found within the aquarium hobby. Their bright coloration, ease of care and peaceful disposition have made them one of the most popular fish species within the marine aquarium hobby for decades. Their inclusion in movies, commercials and countless publications has made the True Percula Clownfish widely recognizable by both aquarium hobbyists and the general population as well. In addition to their attractive and recognizable color patter, True Percula Clownfish also have an interesting swimming style that is produced by rowing their pectoral fins instead of flapping them like most other fish species. Percula Clownfish are excellent additions for reef aquariums, peaceful community aquariums and larger nano reef aquariums.
<p>
When describing True Percula Clownfish (Amphiprion percula) it is important to cover the distinction between this species and the similar False Percula (Amphiprion ocellaris). True Percula clownfish generally have 10 dorsal spines with three white bars, with the middle bar having a forward projecting shape. True Percula also have well defined black lines separating the orange and white areas of the fish, often the black areas can be quite thick. The False Percula will typically have 11 dorsal spines and a taller anterior dorsal fin with either no black areas between the orange and white or very thin black outlines separating the orange and white areas of the fish.
<p>
Percula Clownfish are highly specialized reef fish, who will spend their entire life in a relatively small area on the reef provided that they have a host anemone and adequate food source. Their slow swimming style and ability to live happily in a relatively small space has always made Clownfish ideal for aquarium life. An ideal aquarium setup for Percula Clownfish would include an aquarium of 20 gallons or more, live rock, sand, moderate water flow, peaceful tank mates and a sea anemone host. At a minimum Percula Clownfish should be provided with quality water conditions and peaceful tank mates in order to do well. Percula Clownfish do well in pairs, in small groups of 4 to 6 individuals and singularly. When kept in small groups the two dominant specimens will form a male/female pair, while the rest of the group will stay much smaller in size and will remain asexual. If one of the dominant pair were to be removed or die, one of the asexual members of the group would change their sex to become the male of the mated pair.
<p>
Clownfish are also commonly referred to as Anemonefish do to their ability and desire to live with a host anemone. Percula Clownfish have established a symbiotic relationship with sea anemones in order to provide them with shelter and protection from reef predators, while providing supplemental food sources for the anemone in the food that they will bring back to their host. Their preferred host anemones are those that are found in their natural reef habitats that range from the Indo-Pacific ocean to Australia in the south and southeast Asia in the north. Some of the best choices for compatible host anemones for Percula Clownfish include: Heteractis magnifica, Stygiomedusa gigantea and Stichodactyla mertensii. In the adsense of a suitable host anemone, some Percula Clownfish will host in some species of corals like Duncan Corals, Torch Corals, Mushroom Leather Corals and other similar species.
<p>
Wild True Percula Clownfish feed mostly on zooplankton that are present in the currents above the reef and small crustaceans that are found living on the live rock and sand near the Clownfish's host anemone. Wild caught Percula Clownfish adapt quickly to commercial aquarium foods including flake, mini-pellet, frozen and freeze-dried preparations. Also many True Percula Clownfish available within the aquarium hobby trade are from breeders, thus have been fed commercial fish foods their entire lives. It is best to feed them multiple times per day and to vary their diet to include a variety of meaty foods and marine based plant and algae material. 3 Semi-aggressive 30 Yes Indo-Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Solomon Islands Moderate 74-82&deg;&nbsp;F, dKH 8-12, sg 1.020-1.025, pH 8.1-8.4 Omnivore Pomacentridae Reef Compatible nano_reef Clownfish 2008-12-07 12:00:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/clownfish_percula.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/clownfish_percula.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/truePercula1.jpg /images/fish_marine/truePercula2.jpg /images/fish_marine/truePercula3.jpg /images/fish_marine/truePercula4.jpg Fo8TXiKFP0U http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=82
5 Maroon Clownfish Premnas biaculeatus The Maroon Clownfish or as it is also commonly referred to as the Spine-Cheeked Anemonefish or Maroon Anemonefish is hardy clownfish species that is attractive and readily available within the marine aquarium hobby.  This species originates from the Indo-West Pacific: Indo-Australian Arch. including India, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, New Guinea, New Britain, Solomon Is., Vanuatu, and Australia.  It is a very hardy species that has adapted well to aquarium life and is often bred in captivity, thus many species available in the hobby are captive bred specimens.  Maroon Clownfish are more aggressive than most other clownfish species, especially towards others of the species or similar sized fish.  Maroon Clowns are suitable for fish-only community, more aggressive fish only tanks and some reef aquariums.
<p>
Maroon clownfish are generally maroon in color; however, their coloration can vary from maroon to red to even and orangish-red color.  They have 3 relatively wide white stripes, one near the head, one in the middle of the body and one right before the tailfin.  The fins of the Maroon Clown are round in shape and flow seamlessly off of the body.  This species also has a spine that eminates from both cheeks, thus they are often referred to as Spine-cheek Clownfish as well.
<p>  
Maroon Clownfish typically reach about 6 inches in length and can be comfortably housed in aquariums 30 gallon or larger.  They originate from tropical coral reefs, thus will require live rock or other aqua-scaping to provide them with adequate caves and crevices to retreat to when they feel threatened.  Maroon Clowns are more aggressive than most other clownfish species and should not be kept with other clownfish or similarly sized fish unless in a very large aquarium.  This species will do well as a mated pair or as a single specimen in either community, aggressive or reef aquariums.  Maroon Clownfish enjoy simbiotic relationships with anemones, such as, Bubble Tip anemones (Entacmaea quadricolor), while it is not required to have an anemone with the Maroon Clown it is desirable and will provide the Maroon Clown with a more natural environment.  It is important not to net this species when moving them as their cheek spines will become tangled in netting and can cause damage to the fish.
<p>
Maroon Clownfish are omnivores and will require a mixed diet of meaty foods and marine algae or herbivore preparations.  Maroon Clowns are hardy eaters and will readily consume live mysid or brine shrimp, finely chopped fresh meaty foods, frozen preparations and flaked foods.  They may also pick at algae or other items growing on live rock within the aquarium. 6 Semi-Aggressive 30 Yes Australia, South Pacific Easy 72-78&deg; F, dKH 8-12, sg 1.020-1.025, pH 8.1-8.4 Omnivore Pomacentridae Reef Compatible Clownfish 2009-01-20 17:19:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/clownfish_maroon.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/clownfish_maroon.jpg 56 /images/fish_marine/clownfish_maroon1.jpg /images/fish_marine/clownfish_maroon2.jpg /images/fish_marine/clownfish_maroon3.jpg /images/fish_marine/clownfish_maroon4.jpg ELEhMe2T7bE http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=83
6 Heralds Angelfish Centropyge heraldi Heralds Angelfish is a bright yellow with only a small dark colored area behind the eye. Found in the waters of the South Pacific, this brightly colored angelfish will make a wonderful addition to the established marine aquarium by infusing vibrant color and swimming movement.  Like all dwarf angels, this species is peaceful with all other marine fish except for other dwarf angels.  Their aggression towards other dwarf angels come from their territorial instincts, thus if you have a very large aquarium 125 plus, you can attempt to keep two dwarf angels as they may be able to both establish adequate territories.  Heralds Angelfish require at least a 30 gallon or larger aquarium with hiding places and large amounts of live rock to graze on the microalgae growth.  In the reef aquarium, this species may nip at large-polyped stony corals and clam mantles, but overall is not too destructive especially with noxious corals.  This species does have a unique variant called the Yellow & Black Heralds Angel which is a bright yellow with a jet black stripe on the rear half of the dorsal fin.

<p>
In the Aquarium environment the Heralds Angel is a very interesting swimmer, constantly darting in and out of caves and crevices in the reef/rock work.  They spend much of their time grazing on marine algaes.  While this species can live comfortably in aquariums as small as 30 gallons they do require good reef/rock work in order to provide places to hide when threatened.  Like many other species, they should not be kept with other Heralds Angels or other Dwarf Angels because they will fight.  If you try to keep more than one, be sure you have a large aquarium in order to provide adequate territorial ranges for each fish.
<p>
The Heralds Angelfish is an omnivore and likes to feed on marine algae, meaty foods, Spirulina, brine shrimp etc.. Be sure that this species (like most) is fed at least 2 - 3 times daily what they will consume within a few minutes.

7 Pearl-Scaled Angelfish Centropyge vroliki Peal-Scaled Angelfish are found in tropical marine waters of the Indo-West Pacific, from Christmas Island, throughout South-east Asia and Micronesia, north to Japan, south to Australia and east to the Marshall Islands.  Pearl-Scaled Angelfish are most commonly found on rocky or rubble bottoms of offshore reef slopes and lagoons, especially those with rich algal and sponge fauna.  In the aquarium environment they require strong reef/rock work with many caves and crevices to provide this species with a place to hide when threatened; as well as, area to graze for marine algaes.
<p>
The Pearl-scaled Angelfish is brown to grey-green throughout the front and middle of the body and black around the tail section. The anal fin, caudal fin and posterior region of the dorsal fin have blue margins. The iris, pectoral fin base and area around the eyes are orange. 
<p>
The Pearl-Scaled Angelfish will do best in a 30 gallon or larger aquarium with plenty of live rock to provide both algae for grazing and caves and crevices for protection.  This species is considered semi-aggressive as it will fight with other dwarf angelfish, but should get along well with other community fish species.  The Pearl-Scaled Angelfish is suitable for many reef aquarium environments; however, caution should be used as it will eat sponges and may pick at some coral species.  This is a hardy species if given plenty of marine algae and sponge material in its diet, which will help it maintain a strong immune system.  Because of the need for sponge material in its diet, the Pearl-Scaled Angelfish is considered moderately difficult to keep in the home aquarium.
<p>
Pearl-Scaled Angelfish feed predominately on algae and sponge material in the wild, thus a similar diet is desirable for the life in the home aquarium.  A quality marine herbivore preparation that includes both marine algae and sponge material should be offered.  Their diet may also be supplemented with mysid shrimp, frozen & flaked foods with algal content. 5 Semi-aggressive 30 Yes - With Caution Indian and Western Pacific Oceans Moderate 72-78&deg; F, dKH 8-12, sg 1.020-1.025, pH 8.1-8.4 Omnivore Pomacanthidae Reef Compatible Angels (Dwarf) 2009-01-25 17:19:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/angelfish_pearlscaled.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/angel_pearlscaled.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/angel_pearl-scaled1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_pearl-scaled2.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_pearl-scaled3.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_pearl-scaled4.jpg jEyrOJWinyo http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=85
8 Cherub Angelfish Centropyge argi The Cherub Angel can be found in the western atlantic from bermuda and florida to French Guiana, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.  The Cherub Angel is also called the Cherubfish, Pygmy Angelfish, or Atlantic Pygmy Angelfish.  Like other pygmy angels the Cherub Angel requires rocky caves and crevises to dart in and out of and to provide the fish with shelter when threatened and for grazing of marine algaes.  Because the Cherub Angels is one of the smallest angels at a max size of 3" it is good for those with smaller aquariums, but who would still like to house an angelfish.  Cherub Angels also have smaller natural territorial ranges, making them more suitable for smaller aquariums.  This is a very peaceful fish with invertebrates and other species, so be sure not to keep it with other species that are too aggressive.  <i>(Please see the Aquarium Behavior section below for information on keeping the Cherub Angel with other pygmy angels)</i>
<p>
Cherub Angel is a brilliant sapphire-blue with orange highlights to the face.  A bright blue outline exists on the dorsal, caudual & tail fins.
<p>
The Cherub Angel does not tend to harass invertebrates and enjoys a tank which provides many rocky shelters.  Their territorial requirements are not great; therefore, it is possible to keep the Cherub Angel with other pygmy angels in a large aquarium (100 gallons plus).  If you plan on having multiple pygmy angelfish in the same tank, you will want to add them at the same time to reduce the chance of any problems.  In a smaller aquarium it is highly reccommended that only one pygmy angel is kept per tank as there is a high probability of territorial battles which will result in the death of a fish.  Cherub Angels can also be kept in matched pairs (male & female) in any suitable sized aquarium (30 gallons plus).
<p>
The diet of the Cherub Angelfish should include Spirulina, marine algae, high-quality angelfish preparations, clam or frozen shrimp, and other meaty items such as brine or krill. This species should be fed two to three times daily what the fish will consume within a minute or two. 3 Peaceful, except with other Dwarf Angels 30 Yes Indo-Pacific Moderate 72-78&deg; F, dKH 8-12, sg 1.020-1.025, pH 8.1-8.4 Omnivore Centropyge Reef Compatible nano_reef Angels (Dwarf) 2009-01-25 17:19:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/angelfish_cherub.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/angel_cherub.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/angel_cherub1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_cherub2.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_cherub3.jpg VGSXMPTXDrU http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=86
9 Eibl's Angelfish Centropyge eibli Found in the Western Pacific Ocean: Maldives, Sri Lanka, Great Barrier Reef inhabiting heavy coral growths at a wide range of depths between 30 to 100 feet, the Eibl's Angelfish makes an interesting addition to any heavily aquascaped or reef aquarium.  Eibls Angelfish can be kept without too many problems in a reef aquariums, however it is more likely to pick on corals and clams than the Coral Beauty or Flame Angel.  The Eibl's Angelfish is recommended for the intermediate to advanced reef aquarist due to it's need of excellent water conditions and somewhat diverse dietary needs.  It can be kept with a wide variety of other fishes, with the exception of other pigmy angelfish (unless in a large aquarium 90 gallons plus) or large predators. If you plan to house it with other pygmy angels it is best to add them together to help avoid territorial disputes.   It is possible to keep Eibl's Angelfish in harems of 3-7 individuals, assuming there is adequate space in the aquarium.
<p>
The body is a white to greyish cream color with verticle brown/gold stripes, while the tail section is a dark black with a blue accent stripe on the tail fins.  There are also yellow to orange highlights above the eye and on the caudual and dorsal fins.  Overall the Eibl's Angelfish has an intricate beauty that while not as immediately flashy as some other species, it's sharp lines and contrasting colors make it a beautiful species to have.
<p>
Like most species and especially pygmy angelfish the Eibl's Angelfish is territorial towards both other Eibl's Angelfish and other pygmy angelfish.  Extensive rock work, live rock or reef area is required to give the Eibl's a suitable environment in the aquarium.  The Eibl's will spend most of it's time swimming in and out of the rock work picking at marine algaes and small coral polyps.  While the Eibl's Angelfish is not overly destructive to a reef aquarium, it should be kept with caution as it can nip at corals and polyps and may be damaging to some species of corals.  The Eibl's can easily be kept with other invertebrates such as shrimps & crabs.  It is possible in a large aquarium to keep a school of Eibl's Angels 3-7 members, when kept in these numbers they will form a harem in which one member will remain a male while the other members will be female (it is possible for this species to morph sexually). 
<p>
The diet of the Eibl's Angel should include marine algae, spirulina, high-quality angelfish preparations, and other meaty items such as brine or krill. This species should be fed two to three times daily what the fish will consume within a minute or two.  Being an omnivore it is important to provide a balanced diet of algaes and meats to provide all the necessary vitamins and nutritional needs. 6 Semi-aggressive 30 Yes - With Caution Indian Ocean up into Indonesia Moderate 72-78&deg; F, dKH 8-12, sg 1.020-1.025, pH 8.1-8.4 Omnivore Centropyge Reef Compatible Angels (Dwarf) 2009-01-25 17:19:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/angelfish_eibls.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/angel_eibls.jpg 55 /images/fish_marine/angel_eibls1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_eibls2.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_eibls3.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_eibls4.jpg ZYK0iuVDRpQ http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=87
10 Keyhole Angelfish Centropyge Tibicen The Keyhole Angelfish is found in shallow lagoon waters and coastal reefs around southern Queensland, New South Wales, Northern Territory, and off Western Australia. It is also found around the Moluccas, Philippines, Hew Hebrides and most of the Indo-Australian Archipelago. In the north its range extends to Taiwan and southern Japan. It is one of the largest of the Centropyge genus or pygmy angels and is a little more aggressive than other pygmy angels, but is still very suitable for a community aquarium. It is best to provide large amounts of live rock for hiding and grazing, as this will provide added nutrition and shelters in which to hide when threatened. Keyhole Angels are hermaphroditic, very difficult to breed in an aquarium, and has no distinguishable differences in color between the male and female of the species. Its diet should also include spirulina, marine algae, high-quality angelfish preparations as pygmy angelfish are known to eat mostly algae in the wild, so a diet rich in vegetable matter is essential. There are several good commercial foods available including Formula II and Angel Formula.
<p>
The Keyhole Angelfish is primarily a dark blue to dark brownish-blue almost black throughout most of it's body. The pelvic and lower portion of the anal fins are yellow and their is keyhole shaped white vertical bar found in the mid-central body area giving this species its name.
<p>
In the Aquarium environment the Keyhole Angel is a bold swimmer, working its way around the reef work to graze on marine algaes. Because it grows larger than most pigmy angels, it is a little more aggressive and will aggressively defend it's territory against other pygmy angels and other similarly shaped and sized species. While this species is territorial it does get along well with dissimilar species and can easily be kept in a community aquarium environment
<p>
The Keyhole Angelfish is an omnivore and should be fed a variety of food items including: marine algae, meaty foods, Spirulina, brine shrimp etc.. They should ideally be fed several small meals throughout the day consisting of an amount of food that they will consume within a few minutes.  As with most dwarf angels a mixture of meaty foods, marine algae & sponge material is vital to their health and immune system. 8 Semi-aggressive 55 Yes - With Caution Eastern Indian Ocean, Western Pacific Moderate 72-79&deg; F, dKH 8-12, sg 1.020-1.025; pH 8.1-8.4 Omnivore Pomacanthidae Reef Compatible Angels (Dwarf) 2009-01-25 17:19:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/angelfish_keyhole.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/angel_keyhole.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/KeyholeAngelfish1.jpg /images/fish_marine/KeyholeAngelfish2.jpg /images/fish_marine/KeyholeAngelfish3.jpg /images/fish_marine/KeyholeAngelfish4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=88
11 Lemonpeel Angelfish Centropyge flavissimus The Lemonpeel Angelfish is a vibrant yellow color with electric blue accents around it's gills and eyes.  The Lemonpeel Angelfish is often confused with the False Lemonpeel Angelfish (C. heraldi) which is identical in appearance except for the False Lemonpeel lacks the blue highlights of the true Lemonpeel Angelfish.  The Lemonpeel Angelfish is not a difficult species to keep, but will require significant rock work to provide cover and give this species a place to retreat when feeling threatened.  This species should only be kept with other dwarf angelfish if they are introduced at the same time (preferably when young) and within a larger aquarium (75 gallons or larger).  While most dwarf angelfish including the Lemonpeel Angelfish will squabble with others of their own kind, they will get along well with most other community species.

The Lemonpeel Angelfish is often confused with the False Lemonpeel Angelfish (C. heraldi) which is identical in appearance except for the False Lemonpeel lacks the blue highlights of the true Lemonpeel Angelfish.
<p>
The Lemonpeel Angelfish requires at least a 30 gallon or larger aquarium with substantial live rock in order to provide hiding places and large amounts of grazing area of microalgae.  Lemonpeel Angelfish are very prone to nip at large-polyped stony corals and clam mantles and can be destructive to sensitive inverts.  It is best not to keep Lemonpeel Angelfish with fish of the same genera, unless both are introduced as juveniles and the aquarium is of significant size with a large amount of live rock to create adequate grazing areas for each dwarf angel to stake out their own territory.
<p>
The diet of the Lemonpeel Angelfish should include Spirulina, marine algae, high-quality angelfish preparations, mysid or frozen shrimp, and other meaty items.  The Lemonpeel Angelfish requires more algae and seaweed in its diet than most angels.  Substantial amounts of live rock in the aquarium, will provide beneficial macro-algae growth for the Lemonpeel Angelfish to graze on. 6 Semi-aggressive 30 Yes - With Caution Indo-Pacific Moderate 72-78&deg; F, dKH 8-12, sg 1.020-1.025, pH 8.1-8.4 Omnivore Pomacanthidae Reef Compatible Angels (Dwarf) 2009-01-25 17:19:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/angelfish_lemonpeel.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/angel_lemonpeel.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/angel_lemonpeel1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_lemonpeel2.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_lemonpeel3.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_lemonpeel4.jpg 7bEHlvJla-E http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=89
93 Chain Catshark Scyliorhinus retifer The Chain Catshark is a slender, small bodied shark that is found in deep waters (200 to 2000 feet in depth) off the eastern coast of the United States down to the Gulf of Mexico and Western Caribbean Sea. Chain Catsharks or as they are also referred to as Chain Dogfish have been showing up within the aquarium hobby more and more due to their attractive "shark like" appearance and relative small size. Since Chain Catsharks only reach an adult size of around 2 feet, they can be comfortably kept in many common aquarium sizes ranging from 180 to 300 gallons. They are also a slow swimming species that is used to living in and around rocky areas of the ocean bottom and can effectively maneuver around rock formations in the aquarium environment. Their wide range of habitat ranging from the northern Atlantic waters (50°) to Gulf of Mexico & Caribbean waters (68°) has conditioned the Chainshark to a wider range of water temperatures than many small shark species. The depth at which Chain Catsharks live does moderate the difference in water temperatures from the far northern and southern extremes of their habitat, thus a temperature range of 55° to 66° is recommended for keeping Chain Catsharks in an aquarium environment.
<p>
As Chain Catsharks are a deep water species they are more accustomed to cooler water temperatures ranging from 55-68°, in the aquarium environment it is best to keep them in water around 68° as this will allow them to be housed with other more commonly available fish species used to warmer temperatures and still provide them with a water temperature they can tolerate. The modest size (for a shark) and the natural habitat of rocky areas of ocean floor make the Chain Catshark a good species for large aquarium setups. As with other Shark species an aquarium housing a Chain Catshark should have a well covered top to prevent the shark from jumping out. Strong biological and chemical filtration is also essential to keep up with the bio-load of thick bodied 2 foot long adult specimen. The aquarium substrate should be sand or a sand mix so that the shark does not scratch or injure its underside while swimming along the bottom, as this can create open sores which lead to infections and possibly death. Chain Catsharks are only aggressive towards fish or inverts that they see as food items (small enough to fit in their mouths), so they should be kept with other similarly sized fish species. Caution should be taken when housing sharks with particularly aggressive large Angelfish or Triggerfish as they are known to pick at the fins of small sharks.
<p>
Chain Catsharks are Oviparous breeders with egg cases being laid in pairs, typically once or twice a month. The female will swim around the object the egg is laid on until the egg capsule tendrils are securely fastened and the egg is secured in place. 44 to 52 eggs may be laid during each breading season. Egg capsules are vaguely rectangular ovoid's measuring 1 inch x 2 inches in size. Chain Catshark eggs are harvested for the aquarium trade and have been known to successfully hatch within the aquarium.
<p>
Chain Catsharks feed primarily on deep water prey such as small fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods, ranging from crabs, shrimp, mollusks, clams, squid and small fish. In the home aquarium they will readily accept raw marine seafood's including: shrimp, small fish, chopped fish, clams, scallops, squid, mollusks or other similar uncooked marine meaty foods. 24 Semi-Aggressive 180 No Western Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea Moderate 55-68&deg; F, dKH 10-15, sg 1.020-1.025, pH 8.0-8.4 Carnivore Scyliorhinidae Fish Only marine-predator-zone Sharks 2009-11-12 00:00:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/shark_chain.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/shark_chain.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/shark_chainCatshark1.jpg /images/fish_marine/shark_chainCatshark2.jpg /images/fish_marine/shark_chainCatshark3.jpg /images/fish_marine/shark_chainCatshark4.jpg 6hU2tt7zAr4 http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=385
94 Coral Catshark Atelomycterus marmoratus The Coral Catshark is small tropical shark species found living amongst shallow tropical reefs and tidal pools throughout the Indo-Pacific and Western Pacific.  Coral Catsharks are one of the few shark species imported for the aquarium trade that stay small enough to be properly housed by the average aquarium hobbyist.  With an average adult length of 24" (28" maximum), the Coral Catshark can be housed as an adult in a 300 to 350 gallon aquarium, with a 450 or larger aquarium being ideal.  Coral Catsharks also come from shallow tropical waters that allows them to be housed with a wide range of tropical fish species available within the aquarium trade.  Coral Catsharks have both and attractive body shape and great coloration, and unlike bamboo or nurse sharks, are active swimmers that will spend much of their time swimming about rocky caves and crevices within the aquarium exploring and hunting for food.  Coral Catsharks are by far one of the best species of shark for the home aquarium, as they are suitable for larger standard aquariums of 180 gallons or more maintained by intermediate to advanced marine aquarium hobbyists.
<p>
Like other shark species, the Coral Catshark needs excellent water conditions, no stray electrical currents in the water, a soft sandy substrate, open room to swim and as large of tank as possible.  Unlike many other shark species commonly seen within the hobby, Coral Catsharks are small enough as an adult to be properly housed in a 300 gallon or larger aquarium.  It is important to maintain excellent water conditions when keeping Coral Catsharks, thus aquariums housing this species should have excellent biological filtration, large efficient protein skimmer and a large sump to help augment water volume.  All shark aquariums should be securely covered in order to prevent sharks from jumping out and should be designed with maximum length and width in mind to create the largest possible aquarium footprint providing for maximum swimming area.  Tropical sharks like the Coral Catshark also required very high levels of dissolved oxygen in the water, thus there should be plenty of water surface agitation, additional power heads or air stones to provide as much dissolved oxygen as possible.
<p>
Coral Catsharks can be kept with a wide range of tropical fish species ranging from tangs & angelfish to larger damsels and clownfish.  They should not be kept with aggressive angelfish, puffers or triggerfish that can nip at their eyes and fins.  Aquariums housing Coral Catsharks should contain a mix of open areas for swimming and rock or coral formations to provide caves and crevices for the shark to explore and seek shelter in when threatened.  Coral Catsharks can live in very warm waters and will do well in aquariums with stable water temperatures ranging from 78 to 82° F.  Coral Catsharks are an active slow swimming species that will swim about the aquarium moving in and out of the live rock decor, that when properly fed should be docile to all but the most small fish species within the aquarium.
<p>
Wild Coral Catsharks spend much of their time foraging amongst tropical reefs and within tidal pools looking for a variety of invertebrates like shrimp, small crabs & clams on which to feed, along with small fish.  In the aquarium environment Coral Catsharks will quickly adjust to eating prepared meaty foods including: fresh or frozen silver sides, clams, shrimp, clam, mussel and pieces of fish flesh.  If well fed they tend to leave most other tank mates alone, but there is always the possibility of them consuming small invertebrates or very small fish species. 26 Semi-Aggressive 180 No Indo-Pacific, Western Pacific Moderate 72-82&deg; F, dKH 8-12, sg 1.020-1.025, pH 8.1-8.4 Carnivore Scyliorhinidae Fish Only marine-predator-zone Sharks 2009-11-23 00:00:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/shark_coral.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/shark_coral.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/shark_coralCatshark1.jpg /images/fish_marine/shark_coralCatshark2.jpg /images/fish_marine/shark_coralCatshark3.jpg /images/fish_marine/shark_coralCatshark4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=409
95 Midas Blenny Ecsenius midas Midas Blenny's are found throughout the Indo-Pacific where they inhabit reefs and rocky out crops, which can afford them with plenty of caves and crevices in which to investigate and hide in when they feel it necessary.  They have been a popular aquarium species for many years as they bring attractive color, strong personalities, unique swimming style and a peaceful demeanor to any aquarium they inhabit.  They are able to vary their body coloration greatly depending on their mood, surroundings and activity.  Midas Blennys spend their days swimming or bumping about the reef, moving from one rock crevice to another in search of small meaty prey like zooplankton or similar foodstuffs.  Part of their unique personality comes from their unique bobbing swimming style and the way that they "climb over" the reef with a combination of swimming and crawling motions.  Overall a great community species that is equally at home in a peaceful community aquarium with plenty of live rock or in a complete reef setting with live rock and coral species.
<p>
Midas Blenny's do best in aquariums that are at least 30 gallons in size, so that they will have enough live rock and territory within the aquarium to provide them a reasonable amount of space to be comfortable.  They tend to become more aggressive towards tank mates when kept in very small aquariums or overcrowded aquarium, as do many fish species.  However, given ample space Midas Blenny's are a very peaceful species towards other fish, invertebrate and coral tank mates.  They should be provided with an aquarium that contains plenty of live rock and medium to strong water currents to simulate their natural habitat, where they inhabit the upper regions of the reef which contain plenty of water current.  Midas Blennys are well known for their color and pattern changing abilities as they often take on different appearances depending on their mood and activity within the aquarium.  It is not unusual for a Midas Blenny to exhibit different coloration depending on whether feeding, hiding within a cave or swimming about the currents within the aquarium.  In fact, it is not uncommon for Midas Blennys to modify their appearance to that of other tank mates when they are found schooling with similarly sized and shaped fish species.  Equally at home within a community FOWLR or a reef setting, the Midas Blenny can make a solid addition to a larger nano aquarium all the way to larger reef aquarium setup.
<p>
Unlike most Blenny species that are herbivores, the Midas Blenny is Omnivore whose diet is made up mostly of meaty foodstuffs that it feeds on from the water column along with some algae and seaweeds.  While in the wild the Midas Blenny will eat zooplankton, copepods, amphipods and other small organisms floating about the water column, they will eat a variety of prepared meaty foods within the aquarium environment.  They will readily accept a variety of prepared foods including meaty frozen, flake and small pellet foods, along with brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, cyclopeeze, krill or other meaty marine foodstuffs.  Their diet should be varied with some flake, frozen & pellet foods with vegetable matter included along with access to marine algae and seaweed. 4 Peaceful 30 Yes Indo-Pacific, Maldives Easy 72-80&deg; F, dKH 8-12, pH 8.1-8.4, sg 1.020-1.025 Omnivore Blenniidae Reef Compatible none Blennies 2009-11-30 00:00:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/blenny_midas.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/blenny_midas.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/blenny_midas1.jpg /images/fish_marine/blenny_midas2.jpg /images/fish_marine/blenny_midas3.jpg /images/fish_marine/blenny_midas4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=422
96 Spanish Hogfish Bodianus rufus Spanish Hogfish are found along coral reefs throughout the Caribbean, where they inhabit relatively shallow water reefs looking for crustacean, invertebrate or small fish prey.  They are a fairly large species of reef fish that typically reach upwards of 10" in length and have relatively stout build.  As juveniles the Spanish Hogfish exhibits a peaceful demeanor towards other fish species and will even clean parasites from larger fish.  However, as they mature Spanish Hogfish become quite aggressive towards smaller fish species and will actively bully fish species that are smaller than themselves.  They are prized within the aquarium community by aquarists who prefer to keep FOWLR aquariums containing larger fish species.  The Spanish Hogfish does well with other large fish species like triggers, groupers, etc. and it renowned for their resistance to disease and overall strong constitution.  They have attractive coloration and are strong active swimmers that do well in larger aquariums with other large fish tank mates.  Spanish Hogfish should not be kept in a reef aquarium or with smaller less aggressive fish species, invertebrate or crustaceans as they will be seen as food items.
<p>
Spanish Hogfish are a very hardy tropical reef fish species that will do well in larger aquariums with strong filtration and good water movement.  In the wild this species patrols the top and edges of shallow coral reefs, thus it is well adapted to strong water currents.  Spanish Hogfish are strong swimmers that will appreciate adequate room in the aquarium in which to swim along with small to moderate amounts of live rock or similar aquarium decor along with medium to strong water currents.  Adult specimens are aggressive and are only suitable for non-reef aquariums that contain other large aggressive fish species.  Spanish Hogfish should not be kept with crustaceans, invertebrates or small fish unless they are intended as food items.  They make a great community species in larger predatory aquariums where their active swimming style, bright coloration and strong aggressive personality make them an ideal tank mate for other fish species of similar dispositions.  They require strong mechanical, biological and chemical filtration to cope with the large amounts of waste produced by larger fish species.
<p>
The diet of the Spanish Hogfish varies quite a bit between a juvenile and adult specimen.  Juvenile Spanish Hogfish eat a variety of small meaty foods including parasites off of other larger fish species, meaty flake, frozen or freeze-dried foods like brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, krill or similar marine meaty fare.  Adult Spanish Hogfish are much more aggressive and will consume a large variety of meaty foods including live invertebrates and fish.  Mature specimens will readily consume snails, shrimp, worms, mussels, smaller fish species and a wide range of crustaceans and sessile invertebrates. 10 Aggressive 150 No Caribbean Easy 72-80&deg; F, dKH 8-12, pH 8.1-8.4, sg 1.020-1.025 Carnivore Labridae Predatory marine-predator-zone Hogfish 2009-12-01 00:00:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/hogfish_spanish.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/hogfish_spanish.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/hogfish_spanish1.jpg /images/fish_marine/hogfish_spanish2.jpg /images/fish_marine/hogfish_spanish3.jpg /images/fish_marine/hogfish_spanish4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=429
97 Yellow Clown Goby Gobiodon okinawae Yellow Clown Gobies hail from tropical reefs and quiet lagoons spread throughout the Indo-Pacific, where they can be found living amongst the branches of corals and rocky outcrops.  They are typically found in small groups of 5 to 20 individuals where they tend to stay close to the protection of hard corals or rocky crevices and caves.  It is amongst the coral branches that Yellow Clown Gobies look for small plankton in the currents on which to feed, all the while keeping an eye out for larger predatory fish species.  Yellow Clown Gobies make a great addition to peaceful community aquariums and nano reef aquariums where they can coexist with other peaceful species.  Yellow Clown Gobies bring an intense splash of yellow color to any tank they inhabit, but are also known for their entertaining demeanor and interesting swimming style
<p>
A small peaceful species, the Yellow Clown Goby makes a great addition to any reef or nano reef aquarium containing other peaceful fish species and corals.  Yellow Clown Gobies appreciate the presence of plenty of live rock or branching type corals that it can swim near or perch on.  Yellow Clown Gobies are a very easy going species that coexists well with other fish species and rarely if every show aggression to fish, invertebrate or corals.  They are a shy species that will need to be able to stake out some territory amongst the coral branches of live rock outcrops in order to feel secure and at home.  They will also prefer a place within the aquarium that they can swim with moderate currents that allow them to stay near their live rock or coral home and still have small meaty food items passing by in the current.  Yellow Clown Gobies are easily bullied by larger more aggressive fish species, so their tank mates should be chosen with care.  If possible, the Yellow Clown Goby should be added to the aquarium before more boisterous community fish species so that they have time to adjust to their new home and stake out their territory.
<p>
In the wild the Yellow Clown Goby is an opportunistic feeder that waits patiently for small species of plankton to float near their home territory, then they will dart out to consume it.  Once they are established within their aquarium environment and more at home, they will readily feed on a variety of small meaty food items.  Suitable meaty items include: Cyclop-Eeze, brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, meaty flake and frozen foods, copepods and other small meaty marine organisms. 1 Peaceful 12 Yes Indo-Pacific Easy 72-78&deg; F, dKH 8-12, pH 8.1-8.4, sg 1.020-1.025 Carnivore Gobiidae Reef Compatible nano_reef Gobies 2009-12-08 00:00:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/goby_yellowclown.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/goby_yellowclown.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/goby_yellowClown1.jpg /images/fish_marine/goby_yellowClown2.jpg /images/fish_marine/goby_yellowClown3.jpg /images/fish_marine/goby_yellowClown4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=456
98 Red/Orange Angler Antennarius sp. Red/Orange Anglers also, often referred to as Frogfish spend their time positioned amongst rocks or corals waiting for prey to wander close enough to strike. While waiting the Angler will wiggle a small fish-shaped lure which is a modified fin located on its forehead, which it uses to attract curious fish and invertebrate species within striking distance. The Red/Orange Angler varies in coloration from a brighter red color all the way to a deep orange coloration. Their varying colors allow them to blend in with their natural coral reef environment, where they wait to ambush unsuspecting prey. The appearance of the Red/Orange Angler also varies with various spots, stripes or tassels that also work to conceal the Angler from prey. Their body shapes and colors vary to match corals and sponges within their surroundings over periods ranging from a few minutes to a few days. Overall Anglers or Frogfish are a very interesting species that are well suited for aquarium life and have a unique style that makes them very popular with many aquarists.
<p>
Anglers are a sedentary species that spend their time camouflaged within the reef using their modified dorsal fin lure to attempt to attract small fish and crustaceans to consume. They do not tend to swim too much, but instead use jointed elbow-like pectoral fin to move themselves around the reef with what actually looks like feet and toes. In nature they live in coastal tide pools, shallow lagoons and coral reefs where they hide amongst brightly colored corals, sponges and algae encrusted live rock. A proper aquarium setup for the Red/Orange Angler should include plenty of live rock or live rock with corals in which the Angler can move about. Anglers can be kept in reef aquariums without harming corals or sessile invertebrates, and are also suitable for smaller aquariums and larger nano cubes.
<p>
In its natural environment, the Red/Orange Angler feeds primarily on small fish and crustaceans that wonder close to it or lured over by the Anglers fish-shaped lure. When first introduced into the aquarium, the Red/Orange Angler can be offered live marine feeder shrimp or marine feeder fish. They will attempt to consume any fish or invertebrate that will fit in their mouths, which can expand to nearly 12 times the size of the angler, so care should be exercised with which tank mates to keep them with. The Red/Orange Angler will accept most meaty foods including feeder fish. 6 Semi-Aggressive 24 Yes, With Caution Indo-Pacific, South Pacific Moderate 72-78&deg; F, dKH 8-12, pH 8.1-8.4, sg 1.020-1.025 Carnivore Antennariidae Reef Compatible marine-predator-zone Anglers 2009-12-18 00:00:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/angler_redorange.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/angler_redorange.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/angler_redOrange1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angler_redOrange2.jpg /images/fish_marine/angler_redOrange3.jpg /images/fish_marine/angler_redOrange4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=472
99 Bicolor Blenny Ecsenius bicolor Native to the many rocks and crevices within the tropical reefs of the Indo-Pacific, the Bicolor Blenny (Ecsenius bicolor) is a readily available aquarium favorite and an excellent "nano" or "reef-safe" species for beginners as well as the more experienced hobbyists. Bicolor Blennies are intelligent, have outstanding personalities, comical mannerisms, and love to find a place to perch and watch what's going on around them; they will definitely add fun and personality to any reef aquarium. The Bicolor Blenny has an elongated body with a dark purple-gray to blue anterior shifting to a bright yellow to orange posterior. They have long cirri protruding from between their blue-rimmed eyes, are equipped with combed teeth for algae grazing and will prosper in an established aquarium with mature algae growth. Males can be identified as being larger than females and will have an extension of their first dorsal fin.

<p>

The Bicolor Blenny requires an aquarium of at least 30 gallons and should be provided with plenty of live rock for perching and hiding places; rockwork should be supported as Bicolor Blennies are active diggers and will frequently move rubble, sand, shells, and other small debris, to suit their needs. Blennies are known to be excellent jumpers, so a secure top is recommended for their aquarium. They are normally peaceful bottom dwellers, but they can be territorial and have been known to quarrel with other blennies, small gobies, dartfish and species that have similar color patterns (e.g. Royal Gramma, Bicolor Pseudochromis). They are considered to be reef-safe, but have been observed -in smaller systems- picking at the mantles of clams and LPS corals when underfed (well fed specimens in larger systems rarely exhibit this behavior).

<p>

The Bicolor Blenny is a herbivore and should be fed a variety of seaweed and marine algae-based, prepared foods in addition to algae that is present in the aquarium. Although requiring vegetable matter in their diets, Bicolor Blennies have also been known to eat other foods such as live, frozen, freeze-dried, and vitamin enriched brine shrimp, finely chopped mysis shrimp, and finely chopped krill as well as various pellets and flake foods.

101 Clown Sweetlips Plectorhinchus chaetodonoides The Clown Sweetlips (AKA Harlequin Sweetlips) is native to the Indo-Pacific and is typically found at depths ranging from 5 to 100 feet. The Clown Sweetlips is a remarkable species that completely changes appearance and swimming habits as it matures:  As a juvenile the Clown Sweetlips is extremely cute and has undulating swimming habits which are very similar to a clownfish (a form of batesian mimicry believed to mimic a noxious flatworm or nudibranch in order to deter predators) and a base color of brown with multiple, large white spots (with black outlines) with black and white fins;  As they mature, the Clown Sweetlips will develop multiple, small dark-brown to black spots on a white base color (the spots will increase in number as they age) and they will no longer undulate while swimming.  In addition to the dramatic changes in color and swimming habits, the Clown Sweetlips will grow to be  almost 2 and a half feet in length! The Clown Sweetlips also have the ability to produce a grunting noise by grinding their pharyngeal teeth, which they can amplify with their swim bladders. The Clown Sweetlips is a great choice for the expert hobbyist and it will surely be the center of attention and conversation in a large reef or FOWLR aquarium.
<p>
The Clown Sweetlips requires an aquarium of at least 240 gallons and should be provided with plenty of live rock and hiding places (especially as a juvenile). They are known to be completely peaceful and should only be kept with passive and peaceful species (as juveniles they will easily be bullied by aggressive tank mates). In a reef environment they will not bother corals, but as they mature they will eat crustaceans, mollusks, polychaete worms, shrimp, small fish, and serpent starfish. Juveniles can be more reclusive during the day and will hide in caves and crevices within the rockwork as well as around corals, but they will come out at night in search of food. The Clown Sweetlips is a nocturnal carnivore and can be a finicky eater (especially as a juvenile) when first introduced to an aquarium; they should initially be fed live brine shrimp, black worms and ghost shrimp (in order to trigger a feeding response). Once they are eating well and are comfortable within an aquarium, they can then be introduced to frozen or freeze-dried foods such as vitamin enriched brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, chopped krill, and various prepared carnivore pellets and flake foods.

102 Purple Dottyback Pseudochromis porphyreus Purple Dottybacks are generally sought after for two reasons, their small size which makes them suitable for smaller aquariums and reef environments and lastly their amazing purple coloration.  Their coloration is both unique in color and spectacular in brightness and contrast with other compatible fish species that they would most likely be housed with.  They are also popular for their darting swimming style that will have them zipping in and out from amongst the live rock and corals within the aquarium, which makes them a fun fish to watch.  Their small size and relatively peaceful demeanor make them an ideal fit for most community and reef aquarium setups.
<p>
Purple Dottybacks do well in smaller aquariums as their small size put less stress on the filtration system with their smaller bio-load.  However, if kept in a nano or very small aquarium, it is even more important to make sure that there is plenty of live rock, a protein skimmer and more frequent water changes to maintain a high level of water quality.  Smaller species like the Purple Dottyback require plenty of caves and crevices in which to hide in and retreat to when threatened, this will provide them with a sense of security and keep their stress levels low.  While they are peaceful towards most other community species, they will often show aggression towards similarly sized and shaped species.  Also their small size makes keeping them with larger more aggressive species a bad idea as they could accidently become food for the larger species.  Overall, they are a hardy species that can successfully be kept with a wide range of other community species in aquariums ranging from nano cubes to full blown large reef setups.
<p>
Purple Dottyback will consume a wide range of meaty foods including flake, freeze-dried, frozen and fresh varieties.  It is best to feed them a mixed diet of meaty foods including a high quality flake food, quality frozen foods and possibly live meaty foods like brine shrimp or copepods and amphipods if available.  Ideally they should be fed multiple (2-3) smaller meals throughout the day consisting of what the fish will consume within a couple of minutes. 3 Semi-aggressive 30 Yes Indonesia, Vanuatu Easy 72-78&deg; F, dKH 8-12, pH 8.1-8.4, sg 1.020-1.025 Carnivore Pseudochromidae Reef Compatible nano_reef Pseudochromis 2010-06-27 00:00:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/dottyback_purple.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/dottyback_purple.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/purple_dottyback1.jpg /images/fish_marine/purple_dottyback2.jpg /images/fish_marine/purple_dottyback3.jpg /images/fish_marine/purple_dottyback4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=539#post539
103 Panther Grouper Cromileptes altivelis Panther Groupers are a well known species of Grouper that have been available to marine aquarists for decades.  Their unique coloration and pattern made the Panther Grouper an immediate hit with marine aquarists, but it has been their ability to adapt well to aquarium life which has maintained their populartiy for so many years.  Panther Groups are relatively slow swimmers that prefer to cruis about the reef looking for possible meals and patroling their territory.  Due to their large size and relatively high bio-load, the Panther Grouper requires a large aquarium with excellent biological, chemical and mechanical filtration.
<p>
Panther Groupers are large predatory fish that need to be housed in large aquariums (300 gallons or more) with other large aggressive/semi-aggressive fish species with strong filtration.  Panther Groupers typically reach lengths of about 20" and consume large meaty foodstuffs, which means that they put a large load on the mechanical and biological filtration systems.  It is very important to provide a high level of filtration including the use of a protein skimmer, bio tower or similar biological filter and frequent partial water changes to keep nitrate levels low.  Being a large aggressive species, Panther Groupers should be housed with other large fish species that have similar temperments.  It is important that groupers not be added to an aquarium with an already established grouper living in it.  Groupers will claim the entire aquarium as their territory (unless the aquarium is extremely large) and will aggressively attack other groupers or similar speices if they are added to the aquarium.  In order to keep multiple groupers within the same aquarium, it is best to add them at the same time while stile juveniles.  For aquariums that already have a resident grouper and the aquarist wishes to add another grouper specimen, the first group should be removed and placed into quarantine, aquarium aquascape should be changed considerably, then add the new grouper specimen, with the original grouper then being added back to the aquarium a couple of days later.  While this is not a guarantee for success, it will greatly enhance the odds of the two groupers finding a balance of territory and coexisting peacefully.
<p>
Panther Groupers should be fed meaty marine foods including marine fish pieces, squid, clams, shrimp, prawns, silversides, large krill or similar marine meaty preparations.  It is important to only feed them raw marine foods as precooked marine foods from the grocery store contain preservatives that are harmful to the fish.  There are a variety of frozen meaty foods available including silversides, clams, krill and squid; as well as, freeze-dried and pellet foods made especially for larger marine carnivores.  Goldfish or other freshwater feeder fish are not a good food choice as they lack the nutrients that the Panther Grouper needs to maintain a healthy immune system. 20 Aggressive 300 No Indo-Pacific Moderate 72-78&deg; F, dKH 8-12, pH 8.1-8.4, sg 1.021-1.023 Carnivore Serranidae Predatory marine-predator-zone Groupers 2010-06-27 00:00:00 /images/marine-fish-photobars/grouper_panther.jpg /images/marine-fish-compat/grouper_panther.jpg empty /images/fish_marine/grouper_panther1.jpg /images/fish_marine/grouper_panther2.jpg /images/fish_marine/grouper_panther3.jpg /images/fish_marine/grouper_panther4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=540#post540

1 Marble Crayfish Procambarus sp. Marble Crayfish are found throughout the southern parts of the united states inhabiting a variety of water ways ranges from creeks to marsh areas.  They are an extremely hardy breed that can live in all but the harshest water conditions and will also breed in most any water conditions.  They will tolerate extremes of of ph and GH as long as the changes are gradual.  In fact they are known for their ability to breed at a fairly rapid pace, so this should be factored in if the aquarium hobbyist is planning on keeping more than one specimen.  In fact it is possible that this species can reproduce via parthenogenesis, which is a form of reproduction in which an unfertilized egg develops into a new individual, occurring commonly among insects and certain other arthropods.
<p>
Like most crayfish, the Marble Crayfish is an omnivore and will eat a variety of plant (live or dead) matter, meaty foods, detruse and even a small slow swimming fish if he can catch one.  They are not overly aggressive either with other crayfish or with fish species, but should be kept well fed if kept with very small fish species. 3 Semi-aggressive 20 Easy 68-85&deg;&nbsp;F, KH 3-10, pH 6.5-8.0 Omnivore Brown, Tan, Black, Blue Cambariidae North America Crayfish Crayfish 2009-02-13 00:00:00 /images/invert-MarbleCrayfish.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/marbledCrayfish1.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/marbledCrayfish2.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/marbledCrayfish3.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/marbledCrayfish4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=21 empty
2 Asian Freshwater Clam Corbicula sp. The Asian Freshwater Clam is found in temperate streams, rivers and lakes throughout Southeast Asia.  As with other clams, this species is essentially a living filter that filters the water stream within the aquarium sifting small organic particles from the water column and releasing clean water back into the aquarium.  Freshwater Clams help keep uneaten food, detritus and decaying plant matter out of the water column, which help maintain water quality and lower nitrate levels.  If necessary the Asian Freshwater Clams diet can be supplemented with invertebrate foods or direct feedings via a pipette.
<p>
It is important to remember that Freshwater Clams will not tolerate any copper-based medications and can be adversely affected by even small levels of copper present in the water.  Ideally this species should be housed in an aquarium of at least 10 gallons with medium to very fine substrate, with sand or clay based substrates being ideal.  The Freshwater Clam should not be housed with invertebrate-eating fish, such as freshwater puffers. 2 Peaceful 10 Easy 65-85° F, pH 6.5-8.0, KH 8-10 Omnivore Brown, Tan, Black Corbiculidae Burma, Thailand, Southern Asia Clams Clams 2009-02-13 00:00:00 /images/invert_freshwater/asianFreshwaterClam1.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/asianFreshwaterClam2.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=22 empty
3 Ghost Shrimp Paleomonetes sp. Ghost Shrimp are a species of tropical freshwater shrimp that have become popular in the aquarium hobby due to their interesting appearance and beneficial aquarium substrate cleaning.  Ghost Shrimp are also commonly referred to as Glass Shrimp, with both names eminating from their transparent appearance.  They generally spend their time moving about the aquarium substrate looking for food particles that are lodged in the substrate or on plant leaves or roots.  Typically Ghost Shrimp are added to community aquariums, where they can be kept with a large variety of peaceful community fish species that are small enough not to see the Ghost Shrimp as food.  Hobbyists who keep larger Cichlid species also keep Ghost Shrimp as a food source for larger more aggressive fish species.
<p>
Ghost shrimp are a great addition to any community aquarium with smaller fish species that the shrimp will be safe from being eaten by, they are great helpers in keeping your aquarium clean and your water quality high.  Depending on the amount of bottom feeders Ghost Shrimp can very safely be kept in numbers of approximately 1 shrimp per 3 gallons, with higher concentrations possible depending on food sources and competition.  It is best to keep Ghost Shrimp in 10 gallon or larger aquariums with plenty of hiding places including plants and rock caves.  Ghost Shrimp moult as they grow and during this period their shells are soft and they become vulernable to fish and other aquarium inhabitants, thus it is important to provide them plenty of shelter consisting of hiding places too small for fish to get into.  This is especially important after moulting and before their exoskeletons have had a chance to harden.  Ghost Shrimp prefer temperate waters and should be kept in water temperatures ranging from 68 to 82 degrees.
<p>
Ghost Shrimp can easily be bred in a smaller breeder tank setup or species only aquarium.  While breeding the shrimp is not difficult, feeding the fry can be as they require very small food particles.  It is best to raise them in an established tank with some algae growth and plenty of small foodstuffs; such as, infusoria or baby brine shrimps.
<p>
Ghost Shrimp are pure scavengers and will readily accept a vast variety of meaty foods and decaying plant matter.  They will scavenge the substrate and plants for any food particles that make it past the aquariums other inhabitants.  It is also not uncommon for them to even swim up to the surface and take flake food directly, especially after they become established with their surroundings. 2 Peaceful 10 Easy 68-86° F, pH 6.5-8.0, KH 3-10 Omnivore Clear, Yellow, White Palaeomonidae Americas Shrimp Shrimp 2009-08-05 00:00:00 /images/invert-GhostShrimp.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/ghostShrimp1.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/ghostShrimp2.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/ghostShrimp3.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/ghostShrimp4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=23 empty
4 Olive Nerite Snail Nerita sp. The Olive Nerite Snail is an efficient scavenger that makes an ideal addition for freshwater community aquariums.  They have an attractive shell of marble-sized olive to brownish-green coloration, which is often colonized by tiny barnacles, adding to its interesting appearance.  The Olive Nerite Snail is a popular choice for keeping uneaten food and algae in check, while at the same time it will not unexpectedly overpopulate your aquarium since the Olive Nerite Snail cannot be bred in freshwater.  In order to reproduce, the Olive Nerite Snail requires brackish water as it has a marine larval stage, with adult snails living for about 1 year under proper conditions.  The Olive Nerite Snail originates from the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean and can be found in the lower regions of rivers where they meet costal marine waters.  Like most freshwater invertebrates available within the aquarium hobby, Olive Nerite Snails should not be kept with aggressive fish species like N.W. Cichlids or African Cichlids as they will quickly become a meal for them.
<p>
Olive Nerite snails are highly regarded in the aquarium environment due to the fact that they feed only on the various brown and green algae that are commonly found in established freshwater aquarium substrate, rocks, plants and glass.  At the same time Nerite Snails will not touch living plants or desirable mosses.  If algae populations decline, its appetite can be easily satisfied with algae wafers, Spirulina discs or fresh vegetable pieces.  They are as resilient to a wide variety of environmental conditions as they are used to frequent habitat changes, doing well at temperatures ranging from the 50s to the upper 80s (F) and in waters of 6.3-8.4 in pH.
<p>
The Olive Nerite Snail is a substrate and plant scavenger that will consume debris, uneaten food, and algae in the pond or aquarium. If insufficient food is present, supplement with a quality vegetable based wafer or pellet food.  They will also readily accept fresh vegetables (squash or lettuce), but if fresh vegetables are used it is important to remove the uneaten vegetable after a few days so that it does not rot. 1 Peaceful 10 Easy 65-85° F, KH 5-12, pH 6.5-8.0 Omnivore Green, Black Mytiloidae Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico Snails Snails 2009-08-06 00:00:00 /images/invert-OliveNeriteSnail.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/oliveNeriteSnail1.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/oliveNeriteSnail2.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/oliveNeriteSnail3.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/oliveNeriteSnail4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=24 empty
5 Singapore Flower Shrimp Atyopsis moluccensis The Singapore Flower Shrimp or as it is also commonly know as the Asian Fan Shrimp or Bamboo Shrimp, originates from fast moving rivers and streams within Southeast Asia.  They can vary greatly in coloration, ranging from a brown body with tan stripe all the way to red, green or yellow body colors with a tan to white stripe.  They can change their coloration rapidly based on their surroundings and wether or not they feel stressed or scared.  Their front six legs have fan-like appendages in which they use to filter the water for foodstuffs present within the water column.  They add a very interesting element to any freshwater community aquarium, both with their diverse coloration and their unique feeding process.  Their coloration, movement and feeding and their usefullness as aquarium cleaners has made the Singapore Flower Shrimp very popular among freshwater aquarium hobbyists over the past few years.
<p>
Singapore Flower Shrimp should be housed in established freshwater aquariums of at least 20 gallons, that provide plenty of hiding places including plants and driftwood along with a mature substrate that will provide plenty of detritus and decaying plant matter for the shrimp to feed on.  It should be housed with peaceful community fish that will not pose a threat of eating or damaging the shrimp. 
The Singapore Shrimp is easy to sex when it becomes mature as the males will have much larger and thicker forelegs than the females, also the females forelegs are about the same size as the second pair of legs.  While this shrimp is easy to sex, it is extremely difficult to breed, as it requires brackish water for breeding and to raise the newly hatched larvae.  The young exist in a drifting, planktonic state before changing into a miniature adult-like form after several molts.
<p>
The Singapore Shrimp is an omnivore that primarily consumes detritus and plant matter suspended in the water column, but will also eat algae and leftover meaty foods that are either in the water column or resting on the aquarium substrate.  They use fan-like appendages located near their head to filter small food particles from the water.  Ideally this specimen should be kept in a well established planted aquarium, so that they will have plenty of decaying plant matter and algae available to them from the water column.  Otherwise they can be fed sinking pellet foods that they can feed off of as they breakdown in the water near the substrate. 3 Peaceful 20 Easy 68-85° F, KH 3-10, pH 6.5-8.0 Omnivore Red, Brown, Tan, Green, Yellow Atyidae Asia Shrimp Shrimp 2009-08-06 00:00:00 /images/invert-SingaporeFlowerShrimp.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/singaporeFlowerShrimp1.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/singaporeFlowerShrimp2.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/singaporeFlowerShrimp3.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/singaporeFlowerShrimp4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=25 empty
6 Horned Nerite Snail Clithon corona The Horned Nerite Snail is named for its horn like appendages on its shell.  The shell of the Horned Nerite Snail is very sturdy, with the horns providing them a defense mechanism against fish trying to eat them, or even human beings during handling.  It is an extremely docile creature and does not bother any other inhabitants.  The Horned Nerite Snail is quite small, with its average size being approximately 1/2" in diameter.  It's small size does not take away from the beauty of this snail and allows it to get into places to eat algae that other larger snails cannot reach.  The Horned Nerite has a beautiful black, tan, brown and yellow swirl coloration, that as it grows the color pattern continues to become wider and more pronounced.  The coloration and swirl appears in even the smallest specimens.  There are other color varieties of the Horned Nerite Snail, some with interesting patterns and different swirl coloration.
<p>
In order to reproduce, the Horned Nerite Snail requires brackish water as it has a marine larval stage, with adult snails living for about 1 year under proper conditions. The Horned Nerite Snail originates from Southeast Asia and can be found in the lower regions of rivers or deltas where they meet costal marine waters. Like most freshwater invertebrates available within the aquarium hobby, Horned Nerite Snails should not be kept with aggressive fish species like N.W. Cichlids or African Cichlids as they will quickly become a meal for them.
<p>
Horned Nerite snails are highly regarded in the aquarium environment due to the fact that they feed voraciously on various brown and green algae that are commonly found in established freshwater aquarium substrate, rocks, plants and glass. At the same time Horned Nerite Snails will not touch living plants or desirable mosses. If algae populations decline, its appetite can be easily satisfied with algae wafers, Spirulina discs or fresh vegetable pieces. They are as resilient to a wide variety of environmental conditions as they are used to frequent habitat changes, doing well at temperatures ranging from the 50s to the upper 80s (F) and in waters of 6.3-8.4 in pH.  They do have a reputation for climbing out of an open top aquarium and can survive out of water for some time, thus it is advisable to check for them outside the aquarium from time to time to make sure none have escaped.
<p>
The Horned Nerite Snail is a substrate and plant scavenger that will consume algae, debris, and uneaten food from within the aquarium.  Even though the Horned Nerite Snail is small in size it has an excellent appetite for algae.  They make an excellent tank cleaner that will keep glass spotless and also clean algae off of rocks and plant leaves.  Their small size allows them to clean algae off of leaves without causing damage to the plant and allows them to clean smaller plants that would not be able to support the weight of larger snail species. If insufficient food is present, supplement with a quality vegetable based wafer or vegetable based food. They will also readily accept fresh vegetables (squash or lettuce), but if fresh vegetables are used it is important to remove the uneaten vegetable after a few days so that it does not rot. 1/2 Peaceful 10 Easy 65-85° F, KH 5-12, pH 6.5-8.0 Omnivore Tan, Brown, Black, Yellow Neritidae Asia, South Pacific Snails Snails 2009-08-24 00:00:00 /images/invert-HornedNeriteSnail.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/snail_hornedNerite1.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/snail_hornedNerite2.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/snail_hornedNerite3.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/snail_hornedNerite4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=269 empty
7 Red Cherry Shrimp Neocaridina denticulata sinensis Red Cherry Shrimp have become popular within the freshwater aquarium hobby due to their bright red coloration and their appetite for all types of freshwater algae.  Males of the species are more clear or pink in color, with females having a much more "cherry" red appearance.  When first introduced to the aquarium or when frightened, both males and females will exhibit more pale coloration.  However, once established in an aquarium with plenty of vegetation or other suitable hiding places, the Red Cherry Shrimp will maintain a brilliant red coloration with delicate white markings and their body and legs.  Overall the Red Cherry Shrimp is an easy to keep and active shrimp species that once settled in the aquarium will actively move about the aquarium in search of algae to consume.
<p>
Red Cherry Shrimp should be kept with peaceful freshwater fish species in either a planted aquarium or a community aquarium with plenty of plants, rocks or driftwood to provide them with cover when threatened and a place to forage for algae.  Like most freshwater invertebrate species, the Red Cherry Shrimp needs clean water with very good filtration in order to thrive within an aquarium environment.  It is also important to not expose this or other invertebrate species to copper based medications as this can kill them.  Red Cherry Shrimp should not be housed with aggressive fish species or with community species such as loaches and puffers as they eat small shrimps in the wild.
<p>
Red Cherry Shrimp are one of the easier freshwater shrimp species to breed within the home aquarium environment.  At approximately 2 to 3 months of age, Red Cherry Shrimp will become sexually mature, and the females will begin to carry a clutch of yellowish eggs under their tail.  If there are males present within the aquarium, the female will become impregnated and the clutch of eggs will hatch in about 1 month.  The eggs will be carried by the female until they hatch into miniature replicas of their parents, as the Red Cherry Shrimp does not go through an intermediate plankton stage.  At birth, the baby Red Cherry Shrimp are very small and are easily eaten by fish or sucked up into filters.  Therefore, they should be provided their own breeding tank with a sponge covered filter intake and no fish present that could eat the young.  The babies should be fed a diet consisting of algae, algae tablets, baby brine shrimp or crushed flake foods.  It is important to maintain the water quality of the breeding tank to high levels and make sure that ammonia and nitrite levels remain very low.
<p>
Red Cherry Shrimp feed primarily on freshwater algae, and are coveted for this as they make excellent tank cleaners.  However, they will also consume detritus and uneaten foodstuffs that they come across in the aquarium substrate.  If no algae is present within the aquarium, it is recommended to supplement the Red cherry Shrimps diet with algae tablets as algae makes up a very large portion of their diet in the wild and will help them maintain a healthy immune system. 1 Peaceful 5 Moderate 60-82° F, KH 3-10, pH 6.5-7.5 Omnivore Red, White Atyidae Taiwan, Singapore Shrimp Shrimp 2009-09-08 00:00:00 /images/invert-RedCherryShrimp.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/shrimp_redCherry1.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/shrimp_redCherry2.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/shrimp_redCherry3.jpg /images/fish_freshwater/shrimp_redCherry4.jpg empty
8 Apple Snail Pomacea bridgesi Apple Snails are commonly found within the aquarium hobby, and due to their availability, bright coloration and ease of care have also become quite popular with many freshwater aquarium hobbyists.  Apple Snails due have a very mixed following with one group of hobbyists loving them, while other hobbyists have come to despise them all together.  While Apple Snails are attractive and are incredible consumers of algae, they do come with some negative traits as well.  Apple Snails have a voracious appetite for more than just algae as they will readily consume live plants as well if sufficient algae or other more desirable foodstuffs are not available.  They will also out compete many other invertebrate species for food, as they use their size to push other invertebrates like shrimp away from food that falls to the substrate.  Not surprisingly they also can grow very large and reach sizes upwards of 6 inches, which only compounds the negatives against them.  While the pros and cons of this species are very real, the key to keeping the Apple Snail is keeping them in a suitable environment where their positives can be enjoyed and their negatives minimized.  
<p>
Apple Snails come in a variety of colors and shell patterns including brown, tan, white or yellow and even blue, purple, pink, and jade, with or without banding on their shells.  Apple Snails also exhibit different coloration between their bodies and shells with distinct contrasts like purple bodies and yellow and white shells being quite common.  Apple snails are sold within the aquarium hobby under a variety of names including the golden apple snail, ivory snail, blue mystery snail, golden Mystery Snail and most likely others as well.
<p>
Apple Snails do best in aquarium environments that take into account their strong appetites for algae and other vegetable matter along with their large size.  They will do best in aquariums with hardy fast growing plant species or in aquariums with fake plants.  It is not recommended to keep Apple Snails in heavily planted aquariums with sensitive or slow growing plants or aquariums with less boisterous invertebrate species like shrimp or more passive snail species.  
<p>
Apple Snails have very healthy appetites and will quickly turn to other foodstuffs if algae is not available.  It is for this reason that they are not recommended for many planted aquariums as they can put a lot of pressure on delicate or slow growing plant species.  While Apple Snails prefer algae, they will readily consume vegetables, plants, fish foods, brine shrimp, insects and even dead fish or other decaying matter that they come across while scavenging the aquarium bottom.  If you keep this species with live plants be sure to provide them algae wafers, vegetable based sinking pellets or pieces of vegetable so that they will not turn on the plants living in the aquarium. 
<p>
In the home aquarium, Apple Snails are mostly active at night, while during the day they will usually retreat to shaded or darker area of the aquarium.  When it is night time, the apple snail becomes active and engages in behaviors relating to feeding, as well as mating and laying eggs.  Apple Snails are very easy to breed and if reasonable aquarium conditions of warm water temperatures and clean water are met, they will most likely breed to the point where excess specimens will need to be removed from the aquarium. 6 Peaceful 55 Easy 65-82° F, pH 6.0-8.0, KH 3-8 Omnivore white, tan, yellow, blue, black Ampullariidae South America, Central America, Southeastern US Snails Snails 2009-09-15 00:00:00 /images/invert-AppleSnail.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/appleSnail1.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/appleSnail2.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/appleSnail3.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/appleSnail4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?t=288 empty
11 Amano Shrimp Caridina multidentata Amano Shrimp as they are known these days were once known as Japonica Shrimp, as they were named after their previous scientific name or (Caridina japonica).  However, these days their scientific name has been changed to (Caridina multidentata) and there common name changed to the Amano Shrimp to pay homage to the legendary aquarist and photographer Takashi Amano.  Mr. Amano was responsible for introducing this very beneficial and interesting shrimp species to the aquarium hobby as he kept them in many of his tanks and people gradually began to take notice at how useful they were and the added dimension of interest that they brought to every aquarium in which they lived.  While the Amano Shrimp was initially added to aquariums to consume unwanted algae, aquarists quickly learned that they also brought a lot of interest and diversity to the freshwater community aquarium and were simply just fun to watch.
<p>
Amano Shrimp are ideal additions for any peaceful tropical freshwater community aquarium.  They will co-exist with a wide variety of fish and plant species without causing any harm and providing beneficial algae eating services.  Amano Shrimp are very tolerant of a wide range of water conditions and will make themselves at home in most any aquarium.  They should be provided places to seek refuge when needed; such as, driftwood, rock caves or crevices or live or ornamental plants.  Like all shrimp species, the Amano Shrimp will molt approximately once a month and will need to have places like rock caves or underneath driftwood  to hide while their new shells hardens, otherwise they may be injured while their shell is soft and exposing their internal body.
 <p>
Amano Shrimp are fantastic consumers of all types of freshwater algae, thus algae growing in the aquarium should make up a portion of their diet.  If enough algae is not present in the aquarium, Amano Shrimp will readily feed on a variety of commonly available aquarium foodstuffs including:  algae pellets & wafers, blanched vegetables (spinach, squash, zucchini, etc.), shrimp pellets, fish flakes or just about any other foodstuff fed to fish that they can scavenge from the aquarium substrate.  Be sure to remove any excess vegetable matter that is not consumed within a few hours from the aquarium so that it does not decompose and degrade the aquariums water quality.
<p>
Like many freshwater invertebrate species, the Amano Shrimp requires a brackish environment for their larvae to develop, thus they cannot be bred within the freshwater community aquarium.  However, if introduced into a suitable brackish environment, Amano Shrimp can be successfully bred in an aquarium setup.   The female Amano Shrimp carry the eggs under the rear portion of their body until the eggs hatch into larvae.  Unlike many other shrimp species, the Amano Shrimp young hatch into larvae instead of miniature versions of the adult.  It is at this larvae stage that they are most delicate and require a lot of care.  During their larval stage, the young Amano Shrimp should be kept in a brackish tank with low filtration, gently aeration and a constant temperature in the low to mid 70s for about 20 days.  At this time they should have morphed into their post larval stage, at which point they will be ready to be transitioned back into a freshwater environment.  It is best to raise the larvae in aquariums that are well established with plenty of naturally occurring algae present in the aquarium. 2 Peaceful 12 Easy 65-82° F, pH 6.0-8.0, KH 3-10 Omnivore Tan, Transparent, Brown Palaemonidae Japan Shrimp Shrimp 2009-09-17 00:00:00 /images/invert-AmanoShrimp.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/shrimp_amano1.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/shrimp_amano2.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/shrimp_amano3.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/shrimp_amano4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?t=289 empty
12 Cobalt Blue Lobster Procambarus Alleni Cobalt Blue Lobsters (crayfish) are highly prized within the aquarium hobby for their very bright blue (cobalt) coloration.  This species has been selectively bred for a number of years to produce the brilliant blue coloration that is commonly offered with the aquarium hobby today.  In the wild, specimens of this species vary in color from a brown/tan color to a light blue to cobalt blue color.  However, the specimens offered in the aquarium trade are chosen specifically for their blue coloration and while they may appear a light blue or tan during shipping or when first introduced into the aquarium, will quickly regain their brilliant blue coloration once they are feeling at home.  The blue coloration of the Cobalt Blue Lobster will darken as it matures going from a light blue color in young specimens to a brilliant cobalt blue color in mature specimens.  While wild specimens can reach appreciably larger sizes, the selective breeding the produces the bright blue coloration also limits the adult size of the specimen, with the Cobalt Blue Lobster typically reaching only about 5 inches within the aquarium environment.
<p>
Cobalt Blue Lobsters are quite territorial towards their own kind or similarly shaped and sized crayfish species and will need to be housed either singularly within a smaller aquarium (30 gallons or less) or provided at least 20 gallons of aquarium territory per specimen if kept in a larger aquarium.  While they are generally peaceful towards fish species and other invertebrates, they will eat fish that are very small and slow enough for the crayfish to catch.  Providing the Cobalt Blue Lobster plenty of easy meals consisting of meat based sinking pellets or algae wafers will help curb their aggression towards any fish living in the aquarium, as they will go for the easier meal.  Cobalt Blue Lobsters also tolerate a wide range of aquarium conditions including pH, GH, temperature and water quality and should do well in any reasonable aquarium setup.
<p>
Cobalt Blue Lobsters are omnivores and will readily consume a wide variety of meaty and plant based foodstuffs.  They will actively scavenge in the aquarium, eating any foodstuffs that they can find on the aquarium substrate.  Their diet should consist of meaty foods that they scavenge from the substrate along with naturally occurring algae growth, and should be supplemented with a quality sinking pellet, flake food and dried algae. 
<p>
In general the Cobalt Blue Lobster if very easy to breed in that they will readily breed in almost any conditions.  However, they must be selectively bred to produce bright blue specimens, which take a considerable amount of effort and a fairly large scale breeding operation. 5 Semi-aggressive 20 Easy 68-85&deg;&nbsp;F, KH 3-10, pH 6.5-8.0 Omnivore Blue Cambaridae North America Crayfish Crayfish 2009-09-22 00:00:00 /images/invert-CobaltBlueLobster.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/lobster_cobaltBlue1.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/lobster_cobaltBlue2.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/lobster_cobaltBlue3.jpg /images/invert_freshwater/lobster_cobaltBlue4.jpg http://www.aquariumdomain.com/forums/showthread.php?p=292 5

1 Arrow Crab Stenorhynchus seticornis The Arrow Crab or as it is also commonly known as the Spider Crab, has extremely long legs and a unique pointed head. It is called the Arrow Crab because of the shape of the body and head, which with its angular features give it an arrow like appearance. The size is variable, but many reach around six inches, and some up to 10 inches (females are often much smaller). Different species inhabit different parts of the world, with the most common Arrow Crab (Stenorhynchus seticornis) coming from the Caribbean, but other species are imported from the Indo-Pacific region, eastern Africa, and California. Arrow Crabs normally inhabit portions of the reef where small caves or crevices are plentiful. This gives the Arrow Crab a safe place to duck into if it feels threatened and also provides a safe place to sleep.
<p>
The hardy Arrow Crab is a long-lived invertebrate species, who can be housed in either reef or <a href="http://www.rolexreplicait.it/categorie/rolex/">repliche rolex</a> community fish marine aquariums. Although relatively peaceful, large specimens may pinch at or ward off small slow moving fish that invade their territory or compete with them for food items they are scavenging. The ideal aquarium environment for the Arrow Crab should have many caves and rock crevices for the Arrow Crab to reside in or near and should not have any aggressive fish species who prey <a href="http://www.itorologireplica.com/categorie/audemars-piguet">audemars piguet replica</a> on invertebrates, such as, Triggerfish or Puffers.
<p>
Arrow Crabs will scavenge for any leftover meaty foods and will also accept almost all meaty, flake and tablet foods. Arrow Crabs will gladly accept food given directly to them or they will scavenge the aquarium bottom looking for any meaty foods that the other tank inhabitants may have missed. One should keep an eye out to make sure there are enough food scraps for the Arrow Crab, and if not supplemental feedings directly to the Arrow Crab may be necessary.

2 Australian Sea Apple Pseudocolochirus axiologus Australian Sea Apples are only for expert reef aquarists.  Their bright coloration and unique shape make them very attractive, but they are difficult to keep and can even release a potent toxin if stressed or injured killing other animals in the aquarium.  The body of the Sea Apple, or Australian Sea Apple, is light to dark blue, and it has red feet. The tentacles are violet, blue, red, and have white tips. This a beautiful species that will add a new dimension of color to the reef aquarium.   Be sure to have a large established reef aquarium with both suitable space and solid quantities of copepods and other microorganisms suitable for filter feeding invertebrates.  Most of be sure to have near perfect water quality and many years of successful complex reef keeping experience.
<p>
Australian Sea Apples require an established reef aquarium with both room to move about and large amounts of live rock and copepods from which it will receive a large portion of its food.  Being a filter feeding species the Australian Sea Apple requires moderate to strong currents within the aquarium.   Protect all intakes on pumps and power heads, to eliminate any possibility of being sucked in, as this will both kill the Australian Sea Apple and cause it to release deadly toxins into the aquarium.  Do not house these cucumbers in an aquarium that contains any fish that may pick on its tentacles. Generally, any fish that is prone to pick on feather dusters will pick on the tentacles of the Australian Sea Apple. These fish include; Butterflyfish, Large Angels, and any species that is listed not safe with invertebrates.  They are ultra-sensitive to alkalinity changes and copper-based medication and extreme nitrate levels.  This species is only for the expert reef aquarist. 
<p>
Australian Sea Apples are filter feeders, which extend their tentacles into the water current to filter out their food.  As the food is trapped within the tentacles it is then drawn back into the mouth.  In the aquarium environment, it is necessary to provide liquid foods, brine shrimp or grated mussel.  Typically Australian Sea Apples are fed 3 times a week, but this will vary with the availability of food sources in the individual reef aquarium.
<p>
Caution!  Sea Apples have the ability to releases toxins (venom) that may kill fish in the aquarium when they are severely stressed or damaged by pump intakes or overflows.  Do not keep any Sea Apple with any species of fish that may pick on on the tentacles of the Australian Sea Apple. These fish include; Butterflyfish, Large Angels, and any species that is listed not safe with invertebrates.

4 Banded Longspine Urchin Echinothrix calamaris The Banded Longspine Urchin, which is also commonly known within the aquarium trade as either the Longspined Urchin or Hatpin Urchin, has a dark brown central body with alternating  brown and white striped spines.  These long and sharp spines can sometimes reach lengths of  upto 9 inches.  The spines are generally thick and hollow, yet very strong, while some of the spines are shorter and less thick in size.  This species is found living in Indo-Pacific reefs, where it spends the daylight hours in dark crevices and comes out at night to feed.  During the daytime some species of small fish utilize the spines of Banded Longspine Urchin for protection from larger fish species.  In the wild it is common to find large aggregations of Banded Longspine Urchins living together in a small area.
<p>
The Banded Longspine Urchin will spend much of the daylight hours hiding in between rocky crevices.  The aquarium should have stable rock work and some shaded areas, with large enough crevices for the Banded Longspine Urchin to comfortable wedge itself into.  During the night, the Banded Longspine Urchin will come out to feed, with juveniles foraging the reef for algae and adults preying on invertebrates.  It is best to feed this species small bits of meaty foods about an hour after the aquarium lights have been turned off.  This species should <a href="http://www.rolexreplicait.it">orologi replica</a> be kept with care with other invertebrates as it will try to feed on certain species of small invertebrates.  Smaller fish, such as the Banggai Cardinal, will often seek shelter among its spines during the day, leaving their protection at night to eat.  Like most invertebrate species the Banded Longspine Urchin will not tolerate copper-based medications and needs low nitrate levels. 
<p>
In the wild the Banded Longspine Urchin consumes primarily algae while a juvenile, forging on the reef during nighttime hours.  Adults of this species in the wild, become carnivorous and will feed on small invertebrates.  In the aquarium, meaty foods can be placed near its spines or even on them, with the spines having the ability to transport the food to its mouth.  Adults may be fed meaty foods such as mussell or clam meat 3 to 4 times a week.

5 Black Longspine Urchin Diadema setosum The Black Longspine Urchin, is also commonly known as the Long-spined Sea Urchin, and has a body which is predominately black with a red eyespot in the center surrounded by bright blue markings.  The spines on these urchins are long, thin and completely black, while they may look like a very delicate species, they are in fact very capable of protecting themselves.  This fact makes the Black Longspine Urchin an excellent algae controllers for an aquarium housing aggressive fish species, where other traditional cleaning crew species; such as, snails and crabs would quickly become a meal for a hungry predator fish.  The Black Longspine Urchin is equally at home in the reef aquarium, as it has a peaceful disposition and will not harm other aquarium inhabitants.
<p>
Since the Black Longspine Urchin is a nocturnal creature it will generally spend much of the daylight hours in caves or crevices in the live rock, then venturing out more at night to scavenge for algae on the aquarium substrate and glass.  Therefore, it is important to provide an aquarium with ample hiding places and room to roam.  These urchins are an excellent algae controller for an aggressive aquarium where other invertebrates would be eaten, as when they are approached by a fish, these urchins will sense their presence, and will defend itself by directing its spines towards its offender.  While this species is very capable of defending itself, it is not an aggressive species and can live in reef, fish-only or aggressive fish aqauriums without problems.  Like most marine invertebrates it is very sensitive to high levels of copper-based medications and will not tolerate high nitrate levels.  If it begins to shed its spines, this is a sign of very poor water quality.
<p>
Black Longspine Urchin are true scavengers, that spend their time scowering live rock, aquarium substrate or even the glass walls of the aquairum looking for algae to eat.  Black Longspine Urchin are herbivores and therefore are excellent algae eaters, but will not consume leftover meaty foods.  This species is an excellent addition to an aquarium with aggressive fish species; such as, triggers, sharks or groupers as they can protect themselves with their spines and still keep the tank clean by eating the algae.  Thus, the Black Longspine Urchin unlike other algae eating species like snails and crabs, can solve the problem many aggressive species aquarium owners face of how to get rid of unwanted algae growth without there aggressive fish species eating the cleaning crew.  If there is not enough algae growth in the aqaurium, their diet may be supplemented with dried seaweed.

6 Black Sea Cucumber Holothuria atra The Black Sea Cucumber, or as it is often referred to as the Black Cucumber, Black Sea Urchin, or Lollyfish, has a long black body with a few spots.  This species is usually found living in sandy bottom areas where it will often partially cover itself with sand.  This is a very peaceful species, but can be dangerous if it is stressed or killed, as it can release dangerous toxins into the water.  In the aquarium environment these toxins can be fatal to other species in the aquarium including fish.
<p>
The Black Sea Cucumber needs to be kept with peaceful tank mates, that will pick at it or cause it undue stress.  Do not overstock an aquarium with the Black Sea Cucumber, in general, keep only 3 inches of worm for every 20 gallons of water.  The Black Sea Cucumber is very sensitive to high levels of copper-based medications and will not tolerate high nitrate levels.  Being a sand sifting organism, it is important that the Black Sea Cucumber be kept in an aquarium with a sand bottom, so that it will be able to burrow and feed.
<p>
The Black Sea Cucumber is a sand sifter and will ingest large amounts of sand eating any small food particles present in the sand and then expelling the clean sand.  The Black Sea Cucumber is an excellent sand sifter and keeps the aquarium substrate clean and free of dead spots where excess food can break down in the substrate fouling the water.
<p>

<br>
Caution!  Black Sea Cucumbers have the ability to releases toxins (venom) that may kill fish in the aquarium when they are severely stressed or damaged by pump intakes or overflows.  It does not have tubules of Culvier, but in the wild, if it is attacked or injured, it will expel its internal organs, which can be toxic to fish.  After the Black Sea Cucumber escapes, it will regenerate those organs, although this regeneration rarely occurs in an aquarium setting.

7 Blood Red Fire Shrimp Lysmata debelius Blood Red Fire Shrimp are scavengers and will eat any leftover meaty foods that settle on the reef or aquarium bottom.  Their diet should be supplemented with freeze-dried, live <a href="http://www.replicaderelojesdelujo.com/">Relojes de imitaci¨®n</a> or frozen meaty foods or flake foods.  Depending on the particular aquarium the amount of supplemental food necessary will vary, when feeding the fish it is best to keep an eye on the Blood Red Fire Shrimp to guage how much leftovers it is receiving." />The Blood Red Fire Shrimp is also commonly known as Blood Shrimp, Fire Shrimp, or Scarlet Cleaner Shrimp within the aquarium hobby.  The Blood Red Fire Shrimp is by far one of the most popular shrimp in the aquarium hobby because of its bright blood-red body with white spots and long white antennae.  Depending on which <a href="https://www.orologireplicait.net/categorie/rolex/">rolex replica</a> region of the Indo-Pacific from which it originates, it may have the white dots just on its carapace, or covering its entire body.  This species is not only very attractive, but it also serves the roles of aquarium cleaner and remover of parasites.
<p>
The Blood Red Fire Shrimp requires an aquarium habitat providing it with caves, crevices or overhangs where the lighting is not too intense.  While it will tolerate its mate, others of its own kind will be chased away or harassed. The Blood Red Fire Shrimp is generally peaceful with most other organisms in the reef system unless they infringe on its territory.  As a "cleaner shrimp," it will set up cleaning stations and remove dead tissue and parasites from fish that present themselves for cleaning.  The Blood Red Fire Shrimp is also an excellent scavenger and will move along the reef or substrate bottom looking for any meaty foods.  As with most all marine invertebrates this species is very intolerant of copper or high levels of nitrates in the aquarium.  It is important to provide proper levels of iodine in the water to promote proper molting, which is imperative as this species grows.

8 Blue Banded Coral Shrimp Stenopus tenuirostris The Blue Banded Coral Shrimp or also commonly referred to as the Caribbean Boxing Shrimp, has a Blue body and legs, while the chelae and abdomen have red and sometimes white and red bands.  This species is a member of the Stenopodidae or "Boxing Shrimp" because of the large pinchers on their third set of legs. They often hold these pinchers erect, giving the appearance of a boxer ready to fight when they feel threatened or are trying to intimidate a rival.  Blue Banded Coral Shrimp are not only attractive in appearance, but are also provide many useful services.  Within a community fish aquarium, Blue Banded Coral Shrimp will remove parasites and dead skin from many fish species, while in the reef aquarium environment they are very efficient at hunting down and eating Bristol worms.  Be sure to keep this species singularly and to use caution when keeping them with other less boisterous shrimp species.
<p>
The Blue Banded Coral Shrimp needs adequate room in which to move about the aquarium without its long antennae touching neighboring corals or anemones.  It is also recommended to provide a good amount of live rock for the Blue Banded Coral Shrimp to graze for foodstuffs and provide it with caves and crevices when threatened.  The Blue Banded Coral Shrimp must be kept singly, or as a true-mated pair, as it is intolerant of others of the same species.  Blue Banded Coral Shrimp are known to harass other smaller shrimp of different species; such as, peppermint or camel shrimps.  It is very hardy species, but must be acclimated slowly to avoid any salinity and/or pH shock and is intolerant of high nitrates or copper levels.  It is important to maintain proper iodine levels in the water to allow for proper molting.  Blue Banded Coral Shrimp make interesting and beneficial additions to either reef or peaceful community aquariums.
<p>
In the wild, the Blue Banded Coral Shrimp feeds on parasites, dead tissue removed from fish, and other tiny organisms.  In the aquarium environment, it will accept most meaty flake and frozen foods, plankton, and other meaty items.  Banded Coral Shrimp are also effective bristle worm hunters in the reef aquarium, helping to keep the population of these pests under control.

9 Dwarf Blue Leg Hermit Crab Clibanarius tricolor The Dwarf Blue Leg Hermit Crab or as it is more commonly known the Blue Leg Hermit Crab is a very small species (approx. 1 inch) that has blue legs with small red bandings.  The Blue Leg Hermit Crab is a "Equal-handed Hermit Crab" in that both of its claws are of equal size.  Blue Leg Hermit Crabs make their homes out of abandoned snail shells or similar shells if available, when no empty shells are available they will often kill a snail and takeover its shell.  As a whole, this species is very peaceful and will go about its business of eating small morsels of leftover meaty foods or macro algaes.  This is an excellent "tank cleaner" and is commonly found in "reef janitors" or "cleaning crew" packs.  Because of their small size, the Blue Leg Hermit Crab is able to forage in locations within the live rock and reef that other larger janitors cannot reach.  This makes them an invaluable addition to a balanced cleaning crew along with the larger hermit crabs and snails.
<p>
The Blue Leg Hermit Crab is an excellent addition to any reef or peaceful community fish aquarium, where it will eat many forms of algae including: green hair algae & cyanobacteria (red slime algae).  The Blue Leg Hermit Crab is commonly found in "reef janitor" packs, where its size and varied appetite make it an extremely useful cleaner.  This species is very peaceful and with the exteption of the occasional snail (for its shell), the Blue Leg Hermit Crab will not hurt or damage and other species.  Blue Leg Hermit Crabs are suitable for any reef environment and are prized for their small size and large appetites as they can get into place many other cleaners cannnot.  Blue Leg Hermit Crabs will also eat any leftover meaty foods in the aquarium, which makes them an excellent all around cleaner.  In addition, it provides valuable aeration by sifting through the sand for food which helps eliminate "dead spots" in the substrate.
<p>
The Dwarf Blue Leg Hermit Crab is a valuable addition to an aquarium because it eats algae including green hair algae and cyanobacteria.  If sufficient algae or leftover foods is not available, the Blue Leg Hermit Crab will need to be fed dried seaweed.

10 Blue Linckia Sea Star Linckia laevigata The Blue Linckia Sea Star, Blue Sea Star, or Blue Starfish is typically found in reefs and reef fringe areas, constantly foraging for food on live rock and sand.  Blue Linckia Sea Stars grow rather large reaching 16 inches in size, making them suitable for only very large aquariums.  This species can be difficult to feed as they generally will only consume algae and microorganisms that they find while foraging on live rock.  Expert reef aquarists with very large aquariums, excellent water conditions and a lot of live are most likely to have success keeping this species.  This species does have brilliant coloration that ranges from almost violet to a bright blue color sometimes with red or purple spots.  This species is a good candidate for larger expert reef aquarists as they will not harm other invert, coral or fish species and have a peaceful disposition.
<p>
In an aquarium setting it is important to have excellent lighting and large amounts of live rock to provide enough algae and microorganisms to provide enough food to sustain this species.  Excellent water conditions, live rock and live sand coupled high oxygen levels and stable pH are necessary to attempt to keep this species in the home aquarium.  Rock formations should be built very solidly as this species will spend a lot of time moving about the rock and with its large size it could dislodge unsecure rock pieces.  In the wild, the Blue Linckia Sea Star is capable of regenerating a new starfish from almost any portion of its body that might break off; however, in the home aquarium, this is far less likely.  It is important to acclimate the Blue Linckia Sea Star very slowly to a new aquarium over the course of many hours.  This species is far more sensitve to water chemistry changes than most any other species found in the marine aquarium hobby.
<p>
Blue Linckia Sea Stars forage the substrate and live rock for film algaes and microorganisms.  Due to the overall size of this specimen and the amount of live rock needed to provide them with enough foodstuffs, the Blue Linckia Star is not suitable for most home aquariums.  Expert aquarium hobbyists with very large aquariums and large amounts of live rock / live sand may be able to provide enough food options for this species to thrive.  This species generally does not accept meaty prepared foods.

1 Dwarf Angelfish Dwarf Angelfish http://www.aquariumdomain.com/viewSpeciesList.php?species=Angels%20(Dwarf) http://www.aquariumdomain.com/viewSpeciesList.php?species=Angels%20(Dwarf) Keeping multiple Dwarf Angelfish species /images/icon-with-caution.jpg For the average hobbyists aquarium setup consisting of an aquarium between 2 to 4 feet in length and between 30 to 110 gallons keeping multiple Dwarf Angelfish in the same aquarium will be difficult.  In the wild Dwarf Angelfish establish a territory on the reef to make sure that they have enough feeding opportunities and live rock, coral polyps and small crustaceans on which to graze.  Only larger aquariums 6 to 8 feet in length and 125 gallons or greater are capable of providing enough territory for multiple specimens.  This is also dependant on there being plenty of live rock and the rock arranged in such a way to create multiple distinct territories. Introduce multiple dwarf angelfish at the same time Choose juvenile specimens of each dwarf angelfish added to the aquarium Provide plenty of live rock and arrange the aquarium decor to create multiple distinct territories Experienced hobbyists with large aquariums (greater than 125 gallons) may be able to keep multiple Dwarf Angelfish through over crowding.  The theory behind this is that if you keep 6 or more Dwarf Angelfish in a large aquarium that no single individual will be able to dominate the others and create an established territory.  After a while the various Dwarf Angelfish will learn to co-exist in the same territory provided that they have adequate food.  However, there is a serious risk with this approach that a dominant specimen will focus on a single other competitor and slowly kill off its perceived competition.  Overall this is considered a high risk tactic that should be reserved for experienced hobbyists.  A back up plan is also needed in case specimens need to be removed from the aquarium in order to keep them from being killed. /images/fish_marine/angel_coralBeauty1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_heralds4.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_cherub1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_keyhole1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_eibls2.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_flame3.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_bicolor4.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_potters4.jpg
2 Dwarf Angelfish Large Angelfish http://www.aquariumdomain.com/viewSpeciesList.php?species=Angels%20(Dwarf) http://www.aquariumdomain.com/viewSpeciesList.php?species=Angels%20(Large) Keeping Dwarf Angelfish with Large Angelfish /images/icon-compatible.jpg Overall Dwarf Angelfish and Large Angelfish are compatible with each other in standard aquarium setups.  Both species prefer to have plenty of live rock to both graze and retreat to when threatened.  Providing them an adequate sized aquarium and plenty of live rock will keep both species happy and allow them to coexist without issues. Introduce Large Angelfish that are larger than the Dwarf Angelfish to lessen any aggression Provide plenty of live rock to allow both species to have adequate grazing opportunities Make sure the aquarium is large enough for the Large Angelfish, which will lesson the aggression they exhibit toward tank mates Occasionally juvenile Large Angelfish and adult Dwarf Angelfish will quarrel with each other; however, this very rarely escalates into a serious problem.  Large Angelfish will become more aggressive than normal if housed in aquariums that are too small for them, thus be sure to house both these species in a suitably sized aquarium. /images/fish_marine/angel_coralBeauty1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_heralds4.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_cherub1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_keyhole1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_emperor2.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_rockBeauty1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_king3.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_blueFace3.jpg
3 Dwarf Angelfish Anglerfish http://www.aquariumdomain.com/viewSpeciesList.php?species=Angels%20(Dwarf) http://www.aquariumdomain.com/viewSpeciesList.php?species=Anglers Keeping Dwarf Angelfish with Anglerfish /images/icon-not-compat.jpg Anglerfish are a predatory species that eat fish and crustaceans small enough to fit in their mouth.  As most Anglers reach between 6 to 9 inches in length and can expand their mouths nearly 12 times their own size, they are not suitable tank mates for Dwarf Angelfish who typically reach between 4 and 6 inches in length.  Hobbyists should not keep these two species together in the typical aquarium environment. Do not keep Dwarf Angelfish with Anglerfish Only keep Dwarf Angelfish with very small Anglerfish that are unable to fit them in their mouth Very small juvenile Anglerfish will not pose a risk to adult Dwarf Angelfish and can be housed together for a period of time.  The Anglerfish should be removed from an aquarium housing a Dwarf Angelfish when its body reaches about 1/3 the length of the Dwarf Angelfish.  Once they reach 1/3 the size of the Dwarf Angelfish, the Anglerfish can conceivably consume the Dwarf Angel. /images/fish_marine/angel_coralBeauty1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_heralds4.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_cherub1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angel_keyhole1.jpg /images/fish_marine/angler_redOrange1.jpg /images/fish_marine/sargassumAnglerfish2.jpg /images/fish_marine/striatedAnglerfish1.jpg /images/fish_marine/wartskinAngler4.jpg

1 Amazon Sword Echinodorus amazonicus Amazon Swords are a very popular plant species within the aquarium hobby due to their great appearance and easy availability.  Even though this plant species is found in most every pet store, they do require a moderate amount of care and are not suitable for aquariums with low lighting and without supplementation.  Amazon Swords should be provided at least 2 watts per gall of full spectrum power compact, T5 fluorescent lighting or metal halides with a Kelvin rating between 5000 and 7000K.  They should also be provided iron and potassium supplements along with warm water temperatures between 70° and 82° F
<p>
The Amazon Sword Plant has short rhizomes, numerous lance shaped leaves that are pale to dark green with sharply pointed tips, and fairly short stems. It is an amphibious plant that will grow either partially or fully submersed.  This species is best cultivated in large aquariums that can support the Amazon Swords 20 plus inch height.  When used in groups, they create an interesting background behind other aquarium plants.

2 Anacharis Egeria densa Anacharis  (Egeria densa) is a good plant for beginners as its rapid growth helps create a nutrient balance in the aquarium from the start.  It can also help prevent algae because it absorbs a great number of nutrients from the water.  This plant species secretes antibiotic substances which can help prevent blue-green algae (a type of bacteria).  The growth rate depends largely on the amount of light and nutrition available.  Growth does not stop in unfavorable conditions,  but the plant turns light in color and the tendrils grow thin, it may also shed leaves.
<p>
Anacharis does well in both tropical aquariums and coldwater aquariums.  When kept in a tropical aquarium, they require regular additions of fertilizer and a moderate amount of light. With the addition of CO2 fertilization, they will thrive in even hard water.  Anacharis is an excellent nutrient controller and oxygen producer for all types of freshwater aquariums and is also a suitable plant for use in aquariums that house livebearers. 
<p>
Provide at least 2 watts per gallon of light provided by full spectrum (5000-7000K) bulbs, and keep the aquarium water between 60° and 82°F.  Anacharis grow best in water with an alkalinity of 3-8 dKH with a nuetral pH of 6.5-7.5. Propagate by removing cuttings from mature, healthy plants.

3 Anubias barteri round leaf Anubias barteri Anubias barteri round leaf or simply Anubias barteri, is an excellent foreground plant species that thrives in most freshwater planted aquariums.  Anubias barteri have lush rounded green foliage that over time will increase in thickness (width) from 12 to 14 inches and to approximately 12 inches in height.  Anubias barteri is a fairly slow growing species that will typically add between 1 to 2 new leaves per month.  It is easy to keep the height of this species low, by simply trimming back the leaves near the rhizome with a pair of aquatic plant clippers or sharp scissors.  The trimmed cuttings are also easy to propigate as Anubias barteri will grow well from cuttings and can be attached to rocks or driftwood, re-planted into the substrate or even left floating.  This species can grow completely submerged in water or partially out of water.  In the wild Anubias barteri are commonly found in central and western parts of Africa growing streams, rivers and marshes.
<p>
In the aquarium envrionment Anubias barteri are often attached to rocks or driftwood or planted in the substrate in the foreground of the aquarium.  In contrast to most plants, Anubias generally prefer only moderate lighting levels and moderate nutrient levels.  They should be placed in areas within the aquarium where they will be partially shaded or receive muted light levels, otherwise there is the distinct possibility that algae will develop on the leaves.  Anubias barteri are considered an easier species of plant for beginners to raise due to their low light and nutrient requirements.  They are also very tolerant of a wide range of aquarium conditions along with the fact that most herbivorous fish species will not eat them.  The fact that fish will not eat this species makes them suitable for aquariums with Cichlids or goldfish species.

4 Anubias coffeefolia Anubias coffeefolia Native to the tropical regions of Africa and characterized by a dark green color and heavily ridged and robust leaves, Anubias coffeefolia is considered a slow grower, but is extremely hardy and undemanding. Juvenile plants usually have reddish brown leaves, but as the plant matures, the leaf color will change to a vibrant, dark green.
<p>
Anubias plants will take root on rough rocks or driftwood, which is the best way to encourage growth because the species grows much better when light hits its rhizome. Anubias coffeefolia will grow an extensive root system (rhizome) into your substrate, but burying the rhizome in the substrate should be avoided as it will drastically slow growth.
<p>
Although Anubias coffeefolia has medium light requirements, it should be planted in shade or low light to restrict algae growth on the leaves. This is a great species for a tank with Herbivorous fish and/or Cichlids as most fish tend to leave this tough plant alone.
<p>
Anubias coffeefolia is very adaptable to a wide range of water hardness, pH, and lighting conditions. They have medium light requirements, but will need regular fertilization with a high quality, iron-based supplement for optimal growth. Propagation is relatively easy and is done by cutting the plant at the root (rhizome) with very sharp, sterilized scissors.

7 Balansae Plant Cryptocoryne crispulata var. balansae Cryptocoryne crispulata var. balansae (also known as the Balansae plant) originates from flowing rivers and streams in Thailand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. Characterized by extremely long, thin leaves with ruffled edges and short stems, they are often found in dense colonies with leaves extending across the water's surface. There are two variations of the Balansae plant in the hobby; one is generally green while the other gets an attractive bronzing.
<p>
The Balansae plant requires a moderate amount of maintenance and is considered to be a slow, but steady grower and do not like to be moved once they are established. In optimal conditions the Balansae Plant will easily grow to be over 24 inches tall with leaves at least an inch wide. The Balansae plant can also be grown in ponds by potting the plant and placing it in 1-2 feet of water. Once established, the potted plant can be moved to deeper areas. The Balansae plant should not be considered safe in a tank with herbivorous fish species.
<p>
The Balansae plant will benefit from regular additions of CO2, high quality iron-rich fertilizers, as well as trace elements. Due to the limestone composition in the soil of the rivers in its native environment, the Balansae plant originates in hard water which is loaded with calcium, Therefore, the Balansae plant requires calcium supplementation (in the substrate via tablet or through the water column with calcium carbonate). Calcium deficiency will cause new leaves to grow twisted and deformed, and the Balansae plant will "melt" if it's not in a stable environment. The Balansae plant requires a moderate level of light at 2 to 3 watts per gallon with full spectrum (5000-7000K) bulbs. Given sufficient lighting, it will develop the attractive puckering and ruffling of the leaves for which it is known.
<p>
Established Balansae plants will send out runners, often outgrowing their intended area. Occasional trimming of the runners is recommended using a sterile razor blade or very sharp, sterilized scissors. For propagation, allow the new plant to form its own leaves prior to separating it from the mother plant. The Balansae plant can also reproduce from tubular inflorescences (flower clusters) and well established plants have the best chance of flowering under moderate to high lighting.

8 Banana Plant Nymphoides aquatica The Banana plant (Nymphoides aquatica) -also known as the Big Floating Heart and Banana Lilly- is a unique looking Rosette plant that gets its name from its banana shaped tubers. These unusual tubers are actually where the Banana plant stores all of its nutrients. The Banana plant is most commonly found in Florida within slow moving rivers and calm lakes. It can also be found elsewhere in the Southeastern United States. The Banana plant's color will range from dark to light green depending on lighting intensity.
<p>
The Banana plant is an amphibious plant that can grow either fully or partially submerged and although moderate lighting is recommended for optimal growth and health, the Banana plant can survive in a low light environment. When planting a Banana plant, make sure only one third of the tubers are in the substrate as the plant will also grow a normal root system. In a calm location, the Banana plant can be left to sit on the bottom of the tank and the roots will plant themselves in to the substrate. The Banana plant will grow faster and have a light green coloration with moderate lighting, and will grow slowly and retain a dark green coloration in low lighting conditions. Although the Banana plant is considered a hardy species, it can be severely damaged by snails.
<p>
For optimal growth, the Banana plant requires a moderate level of light at 2 watts per gallon with full spectrum (5000-7000K) bulbs, and will greatly benefit from high quality liquid or substrate fertilizer. Propagation occurs when adventitious plants are formed and pressed into substrate. Fully formed leaves may also be pressed into substrate to form new plants.

10 Green Cabomba Cabomba caroliniana Cabomba caroliniana var. caroliniana, also known as Carolina Fanwort and Green Cabomba, originates from acidic lakes, ponds, and rivers in regions in both North and South America. Its has feathery, lime-green, forked leaves, which are divided into narrow segments and offer an interesting texture that will contrast well with other plants and driftwood. Green Cabomba is a densely growing plant that makes an excellent, natural background in a planted aquarium.
<p>
Under optimal conditions, the tips of Green Cabomba can easily reach the surface of an average aquarium within a week or so and will eventually cover it entirely. However, if lighting is insufficient, the plant will exhaust itself quickly and growth will slow to a crawl. Trim the tops and propagate the cuttings for the freshest appearance. If left untrimmed, the lower portions of each stalk will have insufficient lighting and loose their foliage. Lateral branching in Green Cabomba is not common but it can occur; especially on long shoots allowed to float below the surface. Liquid fertilization and a rich or regularly fertilized substrate is important and considerably enhances robust growth. Green Cabomba will react to nutrient deficiency with darkened leaves, slowed growth, and elongated internodes. Excessive foliage shedding is usually a sign of poor water conditions or CO2 deficiency. CO2 supplementation is not required but will greatly enhance growth. Green Cabomba seems to thrive on light above all else and should be given moderate to high lighting at 2 to 3 watts per gallon with full spectrum (5000-7000K) bulbs.
<p>
Green Cabomba can be propagated by trimming branches from the main plant and pressing their stems at least 1" into substrate. The "topping" method is the best way to propagate this species; if the bottom portion of a trimmed shoot is left in the substrate, it will produce a new growth tip from its highest node. Under good conditions, this species grows very quickly and requires frequent pruning. For an optimal effect, place the cuttings in groups along the back or sides of your aquarium.  Cuttings placed in substrate will slowly grow new root systems and their growth will accelerate. For optimal effect, place the cuttings in groups along the back or sides of your aquarium.

1 Red Mangrove Tree Rhizophora mangle Red Mangrove Trees (Rhizophora mangle) are found growing throughout tropical and subtropical estuarine ecosystems throughout the world.  Red Magroves thrive in brackish coastal waters and salty marshes where most other plants cannot survive.  In fact they are so successful that they actually create their own habitat where other plants and animals live and thrive.  The roots of the Red Mangrove are generally rooted in soil or sand, but can be submerged in water either for portions of the day or on a constant basis.  It is this well established root system that creates habitat both above and below the waterline for species as varying as mammals and birds to fish and crustaceans.
<p> <a href="http://www.rolexreplicait.it/categorie/patek-philippe/">Patek Philippe replica</a>
Marine aquarium hobbyists covet the Red Mangrove Tree for its ability to absorb large quantities of nutrients from aquarium water.  They are often found in aquarium sumbs and refugiums where they are rooted in sand, mud or other similar substrates.  They absorb nutrients from the aquarium water which reduces nitrates, phosphates and other nutrients from the water, which works to starve out nuissance algae growth.  Their root structure also provides habitat in the refugium or sump where copepods, amphipods or other small crustaceans can live and thrive.  These various pods function as a secondary food source for the display tank and as a secondary form of filtration as the pods consume detritus and other fish waste that makes its way to the sump.
<p> <a href="http://www.replicaderelojesdelujo.com/category/rolex/">replicas rolex</a>
Red Mangrove Trees are viviparous, meaning that they reproduce from plantlets that form while still attached to the parent before dropping off and growing into their own new tree.  These fully-grown propagule are fully capable of rooting and producing a new tree or floating in the water for a time before rooting.  They are hermaphrodites that are fully capable of self pollination or wind pollination. 
<p>
In order to thrive in the aquarium environment, the Red Mangrove Tree will need a supply of nutrient rich water, sandy substrate and a lighting source (5500K to 6700K for ideal conditions).  Being that they originate from tropical origins, the Red Mangrove is accustomed to long periods of sunlight from 12 to 14 hours per day.  Mangrove Trees in the home aquarium will need to be pruned and harvested from time to time in order to keep their growth in check.  Red Mangrove Trees in the wild can commonly grow upwards of 20 feet or more without pruning.  However, rapid growth in the home aquarium is a good thing as it means that large quantities of nutrients are being removed from the aquarium water.  After pruning parent trees and removing the cipplings, the nutrients are effectively exported or removed from the aquarium.

3 Chaetomorpha Algae Chaetomorpha sp. <b>General Info</b>
<p> 
Chaetomorpha sp. is a form of macroalgae that typically grows in long strands that ball up in clumps, where the clump then grows in size as the algae absorbs light and nutrients from the water column. Chaetomorpha Algae has become a favorite amongst reef aquarium keepers for its ability to absorb excess nutrients from the water column and ease of care. Chaetomorpha Algae <a href="http://www.rolexreplicait.it/">replica orologi svizzeri</a> can be placed in sumps or refugiums with moderate water flow and plenty of <a href="http://www.replicaderelojesdelujo.com/category/rolex/">rolex replica</a> lighting, here they will absorb phosphates and nitrates from the water column as they continue to grow, then portions of the plant can be harvested or removed from the sump, which will effectively export the excess nutrients they absorbed while growing from the aquarium. Its low cost, ease of care and widespread availability has made Chaetomorpha Algae the macroalgae filtration of choice for many marine aquarium hobbyists.

Beyond its nutrient filtering capability, Chaetomorpha Algae grown in the refugium also provides habitat for a wide variety of beneficial organisms like copepods, amphipods, worms and mini starfish. Another added benefit of Chaetomorpha Algae over many similar macroalgae is that it does not go through a sexual period like Caulerpa where nutrients are released back into the aquarium water. Utilizing Chaetomorpha Algae for nutrient removal, along with live rock and live sand for de-nitrification and a protein skimming makes for an excellent combination of filtration for marine reef or FOWLR aquariums.
<p>
<b>Growth and Feeding</b>
<p>
While Chaetomorpha Algae is easy to grow in most conditions, it will be much more efficient at nutrient export if provided ideal conditions. Ideally Chaetomorpha Algae should be grown in the sump or refugium where it will have low water currents and can be provided plenty of light. While Chaetomorpha Algae can survive in lower lighting conditions, it should be provided 75 to 100 watts of 5100K to 6700K floodlight lighting or equivalent fluorescent lighting to thrive. It is important to promote a good growth rate, as the harvested Chaetomorpha Algae is what removes the nutrients from the aquarium ecosystem. Faster algae growth will allow for more frequent harvesting, which will in turn increase the filtration benefit of the Chaetomorpha Algae.

4 Halimeda Plant Halimeda sp. The Halimeda Plant (Halimeda sp.) is a calcareous form <a href="http://www.rolexreplicait.it/">orologio hublot</a> of green macroalgae that is found growing throughout the worlds tropical regions. Calcareous <a href="http://www.replicaderelojesdelujo.com/category/rolex/">replica rolex</a> species like the Halimeda Plant require calcium carbonate, calcium or limestone in order to grow each segment of the plant. The joints between the <a href="https://www.orologireplicait.net/categorie/breitling/">orologio breitling</a> calcareous growths are flexible, which allow the plant to cope with water currents and disturbances from large fish or invertebrates. Halimeda macroalgae is coveted within the marine aquarium for its attractive appearance and controlled growth rate. Halimeda Plants can coexist with both sessile invertebrates and corals, as they grow upwards towards the light and do not infringe on nearby neighbors. This plant is also suitable for most FOWLR aquariums as most fish species will not eat the Halimeda Plant. However, Halimeda macroalgae is intolerant of high levels of nitrate or phosphate that are often found in elevated levels in FOWLR aquariums.
<p>
Halimeda calcareous algae grow well in environments with high calcium, medium light, very low levels of nitrates and phosphates, and low amounts of iron in the 0.05 ppm range. Halimeda grows more upwards that outwards, thus they are generally planted in a sandy substrate or attached to live rock that is placed on the aquarium or sump substrate. Planting the Halimeda Plant in the substrate allows it plenty of room to grow before requiring pruning. This does not do well when pruned too often; therefore, it is better to plant it in such a way that it will have plenty of room for growth. In addition to moderate to high lighting and a steady supply of calcium supplementation, the Halimeda Plant requires low levels of dissolved nutrients like nitrate and phosphate.
<p>
Halimeda macroalgae require plenty of calcium, some iron and moderate lighting in order to thrive within the marine aquarium environment. They will also grow in other lighting conditions, but will always require a steady source of calcium in order to build their calcareous based structure. They should be provided moderate water flow and water that is low in dissolved nutrients.

5 Maidens Hair Plant Chlorodesmis sp. Maiden's Hair (Chlorodesmis sp.) is a form of green filamentous macroalgae that grows in thick clumps that resemble grass or turf. It's bright green coloration and grass like appearance has made the Maiden's Hair Plant a popular addition to many marine reef and FOWLR aquariums; as well as, sumps and refugiums. The plant contains a substance in it that is toxic to fish, which keeps herbivorous fish species from consuming it. This allows the Maiden's Hair Plant to be placed into aquariums where many marine plants would be quickly consumed. The Maiden's Hair Plant also makes excellent habitat for small beneficial crustaceans like copepods and amphipods, who use the dense plant to retreat from fish and larger invertebrates who would prey on them.
<p>
The Maiden's Hair Plant requires an aquarium environment with low nitrate and no dissolved copper, plenty of water flow and strong lighting. It's growth rate under ideal conditions is considered moderate. It will grow outward onto nearby rocks, corals or sessile invertebrates. Maiden's Hair generally only grows to about 8 inches in height, preferring to spread horizontally along the reef through fragmentation and sporulation. The plants need a firm surface like a rock or coral skeleton on which to attach itself. Spacing rocks containing Maiden's Hair away from other rocks by leaving an area of open sand can control the growth of the macroalgae in aquariums where excellent growth conditions are causing the plant to grow too rapidly. Maiden's Hair can be pruned by simply removing clumps of the plant from the rock on which it is attached and disposing the excess plant material.
<p>
In order for Maiden's hair to prosper either in the aquarium, sump or refugium environment it needs strong lighting and strong water current. Strong lighting is crucial as the plant uses photosynthesis to produce food for itself my converting light to energy. Strong water current is also important as it moves waste products produced by the plant away and provides for proper respiration.

6 Shaving Brush Plant Penicillus sp. The Shaving Brush Plant (Penicillus sp.) is a popular plant species amongst marine aquarium hobbyists both for its hardy nature and filtration capabilities.  Named for its unique shape that looks similar to a brush used for applying shaving cream, the Shaving Brush Plant has proven itself to be useful in both refugiums and within the display aquarium.  Shaving Brush Plants should be planted in the sand bed of the aquarium or refugium and provided with both moderate lighting and water flow.  The tubular stalk and long thin leaves give the plant the appearance of a plant as opposed to many other forms of macroalgae that grow in clumps or long strands.  Unlike many species of marine plants that quickly become fish food if placed within the display aquarium, the Shaving Brush Plant is not often consumed by fish or other tank inhabitants.  Hobbyists should ensure that the plants remain rooted in the sand bed and are placed where they can receive both moderate water flow and lighting.  While the plants are adept at removing nitrates and phosphates from the water column for food, they should also be provided supplemental iron and trace elements in order to maintain good growth.  The Shaving Brush Plant also makes an excellent addition to vegetable sump filters and refugiums, where it will work towards removing excess nutrients from the aquarium water.
<p>
Marine aquarium hobbyists have found the Shaving Brush Plant to be both an excellent chemical filtration tool and an attractive aquarium decoration.  Whether used in the display aquarium or refugium, Shaving Brush Plants are excellent at removing excess nutrients from the aquarium.  Unlike many other forms of macroalgae, this species both looks attractive when rooted in the aquarium substrate and will not be eaten by the vast majority of aquarium inhabitants.  Moderate to high lighting should be provided, along with plenty of indirect water flow.  The addition of trace elements via water changes and iron supplementation should be provided for good long term health.  Overall this is an excellent plant species for all levels of marine aquarium hobbyists and for both FOWLR and reef aquarium environments.
<p>
Shaving Brush Plants grow in sandy shallow water fields in the wild.  In nature they utilize both sunlight and nutrients found in the water for food and depend on water currents to remove waste products away from the plant.  Hobbyists should be sure that they provide plenty of high intensity lighting and at least moderate water flow in order to provide proper care for this species.  For the best care, plant them in aquarium or refugium substrate in an area that is well illuminated and receives plenty of laminar or varied water flow.

7 Mermaid Fan Plant Udotea sp. The Mermaid Fan Plant (Udotea sp.) is a calcareous algae species found throughout the Caribbean growing both in sand flats and near rocky structures.  The plant is found growing both in the sandy ocean substrate and attached to live rock or coral structures.  They build themselves out into a fan like pattern through deposits of calcium carbonate that is found in their tissues.  The tissue of the Mermaid Fan Plant stores calcium that it uses for energy as it grows.  Thus it is important to provide calcium supplementation to the aquarium in order to ensure the proper health of the plant and other organisms like Corals and Invertebrates that depend on calcium in order to grow.  Being that the Mermaid Fan Plant is made up of calcareous deposits, most fish will not see this as a source of food and will leave the plant alone.  Overall the Mermaid Fan Plant is a very hardy plant species that is well suited for both the display aquarium or sump in reef or FOWLR setups.
<p>
Mermaid Fan Plants are a hardy species that is found widely distributed throughout the Caribbean, tropical coastal Atlantic and areas off the coast of Central America.  They require plenty of direct lighting and calcium supplementation in order to grow and thrive.  Due to the calcareous makeup of the plants tissue, most fish will not attempt to eat or pick at this plant which makes them more suitable for FOWLR aquariums than most plant species.  The Mermaid Fan Plant also works well as a supplemental filtration source by removing both nitrate and phosphate from the water column.  It is difficult to prune this species without causing damage to the plant due to the layered composition of the plants body.  Care should be taken if pruning is attempted.
<p>
Mermaid Fan Plants are excellent consumers of excess nutrients including nitrates and phosphates.  In addition to feeding on these nutrients, they require moderate to strong lighting and calcium supplementation.  If placed in the substrate of the main aquarium, be sure to place this plant somewhere where it can obtain plenty of light and moderate water flow.  Plants placed in sumps tend to be placed much closer to the light source, thus do not need as intense lighting in order to thrive.

8 Red Grape Kelp Botryocladia sp. Red Grape Kelp (Botryocladia sp.) is found in slightly varying forms throughout the worlds marine environments.  Botryocladia spp. has an appearance similar to forms of Grape Caulerpa only red in color instead of green. <a href="https://www.orologireplicait.net/orologio-repliche-audemars-piguet-royal-oak/">audemars piguet replica</a> The plant does very well in the marine aquarium environment and can be kept in the main aquarium, sump or refugium.  Red Grape Kelp requires moderate to high lighting along with moderate water flow and nutrient levels.  Many hobbyists utilize this plant as a form of nutrient export, the plant is grown in a sump or refugium where is removes nutrients from the water column then is fed to herbivorous fish species who consume the plant.  If keeping Red Grape Kelp in the aquarium as an ornamental plant, it cannot be kept with herbivorous fish as they will eagerly consume the plant.
<p>
Red Grape Kelp generally grows less than a 12 inches tall before it begins to grow outwards using its creeping vines to attach to nearby rocks.  It will grow more rapidly in aquariums or sumps with strong lighting and moderate nutrient levels on which the plant can feed.  Overall Botryocladia spp. makes and excellent plant for filtration purposes as it consumes nutrients rapidly, is easy to prune and makes an excellent food source for many fish species. <a href="http://www.replicaderelojesdelujo.com/category/patek-philippe/">Patek Philippe replicas</a> Red Grape Kelp is a very attractive plant that can be used as an ornamental plant in aquariums that do not contain fish species that will consume it.  However, its rapid growth and creeping vines might make it unsuitable for many reef aquariums as it can grown in and on corals and filtration equipment.
<p>
Hobbyists looking to grow Red Grape Kelp for a supplemental food source for their fish will want to place the plant in a well lit sump or refugium with a moderate amount of water flow. <a href="http://www.rolexreplicait.it/">orologi repliche</a> The plant can be easily pruned and placed into the display tank for fish to feed on.  Botryocladia spp. is a highly sought after form or macro-algae that most herbivore fish species will readily consume, which along with its high nutritional value make it an excellent supplemental food source.

9 Ulva Lettuce Algae Ulva sp. Ulva Lettuce Algae (Ulva sp.) is a popular macro algae amongst marine aquarium hobbyists both for its filtration capabilities and as a supplemental food source for herbivorous fish species. Ulva Lettuce Algae is typically sold in free floating clumps that can be placed in a refugium or sump compartment. It is important to place the Ulva Lettuce Algae in a location with high water flow as this will allow the macro algae to filter a greater amount of nitrate and phosphate from the aquarium. This will increase both its filtration capabilities and will cause it to grow faster so that plant matter fed to fish can be quickly replaced.
<p>
Since the Ulva Lettuce Algae requires high water flow and is free floating, it should ideally be located in a sump compartment that is part of the main aquarium filter system. Add on refugiums typically do not have enough water flow to provide enough nutrients for the Ulva Lettuce Algae to go rapidly and thrive. Sump based refugiums that are in-line with the main filtration pump are more ideally suited as the entire water volume of the aquarium passes through the sump multiple times per hour. Once the macro algae has utilized the nitrates and phosphates in the aquarium water for its growth, it can then be fed to fish or pruned and removed from the aquarium. This process is called nutrient export, since the nutrients are completely removed from the water column.
<p>
Hobbyists looking to grow Ulva Lettuce Algae for a supplemental food source for their fish will want to place the plant in a well lit sump or refugium with a moderate amount of water flow. The plant can be easily pruned and placed into the display tank for fish to feed on.

2 Temensis Peacock Bass species profile added temensis-peacock-bass-species-profile-added Freshwater > New World Cichlids > Peacock Bass <p>New! Temensis Peacock Bass species profile added.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fish_freshwater/cichla_temensis2.jpg" width="375" height="300" /></p> <p>Temensis Peacock Bass (Cichla temensis) is the largest member of the peacock bass genus and is a top level predator in their native South American river habitat. They are most often found in slow moving or still water environments like lagoons, backwaters and shoreline pockets. While Temensis Peacock Bass spend a good portion of their time in calm waters, they will readily move out into faster waters to feed and to ward off potential competitors. Temensis Peacock Bass are used to environments that have warm water year round, with temperatures reaching upwards of 86&deg; during the day and around 80&deg; during evening hours. Their native river habitat's water conditions are acidic with a pH range of 5.0 to 6.5 and a water hardness between 5 to 15 dH; as well as, fast flowing with a large volume of water passing down from the mountains on its way to the ocean. Cichla temensis have evolved perfectly for their environment with long sleek bodies and powerful pectoral and anal fins, which they use to maintain ambush positions in rapidly flowing waters and ambush prey. Temensis Peacock Bass are becoming much more available within the aquarium hobby as their size, pattern, coloration and aggressive feeding habits have made them very popular with aquarium hobbyists interested in keeping larger New World Cichlid species.</p>

3 Beginners guide to keeping Neon Tetra beginners-guide-to-keeping-neon-tetra A freshwater aquarium hobbyist guide to keeping Neon Tetra <p>Complete guide to keeping Neon Tetra in the home aquarium.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fish_freshwater/neonTetraBlog_1.jpg" width="517" height="390" /></p> <h2><strong>Where do Neons come from?</strong></h2>
<p>Neon Tetras are native to the streams and small tributaries of the Amazon including areas of southeastern Colombia, northeast Peru and northern and western parts of Brazil. They thrive in blackwater and murky water areas of dense vegetation, including flood plains during the rainy season. Neon Tetras in the wild are found in large schools staying close to the lower areas of the streams and creeks in which they live, close to vegetation and root structures that afford them protection from larger predatory fish species. While it is not necessary to completely recreate their natural environment in the home aquarium, it is important to provide some key aspects of it. If you plan to keep Neon Tetras in your community freshwater aquarium, you should plan to provide areas of lower lighting with either vegetation or root structure to provide them a reasonable comfort level with their environment and a place to escape larger more aggressive species.</p>

<h2><strong>Choosing healthy specimens and proper quantities for your aquarium</strong></h2>
<p>When selecting Neon Tetras for your aquarium it is important to choose healthy specimens that will be able to cope well with the transition into their new aquarium environment. Specimens should be active swimmers that swim purposely in the aquarium and do not float or drift in the water as this is a sign of poor health. Healthy specimens will also exhibit bright well defined colors that are not washed out or faded in appearance. General fish selection rules apply as well, in that the store aquarium should be clean, free of any odors and dead fish. Since the Neon Tetra is a very small fish it is a little more suseptible to fluctuations in water chemistry, so it is important to acclimate them slowely to their new environment.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fish_freshwater/neonTetraBlog_3.jpg" width="500" height="351" /></p>
<p>In addition, Neon Tetra are a schooling fish and should absolutely be kept in reasonable sized schools in order for them to thrive in the home aquarium. The size of the school will vary depending on aquarium size, but at least a group of 8 or more specimens should be doable in most all but the smallest aquariums. Larger schools tend to do even better as the numbers provide the Neon Tetra with a good comfort zone and feeling of safety. It is not uncommon to see schools of Neon Tetra as large as 20 to 30 fish in even moderately sized aquariums because of their relatively small size. Last but certainly not least is the sheer beauty of a large school of Neon Tetra with their vibrant color and closely grouped schools, they provide a truly impressive site within the community freshwater aquarium.</p>
<h2><strong>Aquarium life</strong></h2>
<p>Neon Tetras are suitable for the beginning aquarium hobbyist, but they do require that the aquarium environment support their basic needs. In the wild, Neon Tetra generally live in water that is cooler as it is well shaded from the sun and somewhat on the acidic side, ranging from a pH of 5.0 to 7.0 and KH or 1.0 to 2.0. However, within the aquarium environment they can be acclimated to tolerate brighter lighting conditions and pH as high as 7.5 if they are brought into these conditions gradually as not to shock the fish. This is best accomplished by emptying the newly bought Neon Tetra into a container with the store bag water and the fish. Then, every 5 minutes a cup full of water can be added to the container for 20 to 30 minutes. This will give the fish time to adjust to both the water chemistry and temperature of the aquarium system. After this acclimation process is complete the fish should be netted and added to the aquarium and the water in the acclimating container should be discarded.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fish_freshwater/neonTetraBlog_4.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p>Once in the aquarium, Neon Tetra should be provided plenty of places to hide if threatened; such as, live or fake plants, drift wood or root structures or large rocks. Due to their size and overall very passive nature, Neon Tetra should only be kept with other peaceful community species that will not grow large enough to eat them. While they reach just over an inch in size when fully grown, they do form tight schools that help give them protection from other larger fish species, so it is strongly recommended that this species be kept in good sized groups which will benefit their overall health and security.</p>
<h2><strong>Sexing and Breeding</strong></h2>
<p>Female and Male Neon Tetras have very subtle physical differences with the female having a more round body and curvature of the blue line, while the male is more slender and has a straight blue line. The curvature of the blue line in the female is most likely due to the location of the egg sack that even when empty creates a slightly more rounded appearance to the body.</p>
<p>Typically Neon Tetras are bred in conditions that closely mimic their natural surroundings including dim lighting and cooler water temperatures of around 72 to 75 degrees fahrenheit or 24 degrees celsius. The breeding aquarium should also have live plants that provide areas of the aquarium with high levels of shade and provide the fish a location to deposit their eggs. Breeders will often try to induce mating by lowering the KH to 1.0 or by letting nitrate levels rise and then replace 50% of the water with fresh RO/DI water along with brighter lighting to simulate the rainy season.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fish_freshwater/neonTetraBlog_5.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p>Once the eggs have been laid it is important to remove the adults as they will often eat young fry. The young are sensitive to higher lighting levels, so the lights should be maintained a low level and other water parameters should remain stable and constant. Eggs typically hatch within 24 hours and fry will reach their adult coloration within 30 days. During this time they can be fed a diet of rotifers, egg yolk, baby brine shrimp or other prepared foods formulated for newly hatched fish.</p>
<h2><strong>In conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Overall the Neon Tetra is a hardy small fish species that brings a lot of color and activity to peaceful freshwater community aquariums. With a reasonable amount of care, a beginner aquarium hobbyist can not only maintain this species, but create an environment in which they can thrive.</p> 5 publish 2014-09-12 21:37:00 2014-09-12 21:37:00 2016-05-21 12:42:33 jhooper 1 neon tetra 3 Sharon, vettikart, Bob 0
4 The Nitrogen Cycle and New Tank Syndrome the-nitrogen-cycle-and-new-tank-syndrome <p>The nitrogen cycle as it pertains to the home aquarium is the process of establishing beneficial bacteria in order to break down nitrogenous waste compounds into less harmful nitrates that can be removed from the aquarium via plants or water changes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/nitrogenCycle.jpg" width="325" height="206" /></p> <h2>Food in equals waste out</h2>
<p>Like all living creatures, fish give off waste products, these nitrogenous waste products break down into ammonia (NH3), which is highly toxic to both fish &amp; Invertebrates. In nature, the volume of water per fish is extremely high and waste products become diluted to low concentrations and are ultimately purified by the mass amounts of nitrofying bacteria that exist. In aquariums, however, it can take as little as a few hours for ammonia concentrations to reach toxic levels. How much ammonia is too much? The quick answer is: if a test kit is able to measure it, you've got too much, it's in a high enough concentrations to stress fish and cause irritation. Consider emergency action such as water changes using Reverse Osmosed water or ammonia locking products, if your ammonia levels are .25ppm or higher.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nitrogenCycle.gif" width="439" height="339" /></p>

<h2>What Is the Nitrogen Cycle?</h2>
<p>The Nitrogen Cycle is the biological process that converts ammonia into other, relatively harmless nitrogen compounds. Fortunately, several species of bacteria do this conversion for us. Some species convert ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (N02-), while others convert nitrite to nitrate (NO3-). Thus, cycling the tank refers to the process of establishing bacterial colonies in the filter bed that convert ammonia -&gt; nitrite -&gt; nitrate. Nitrate is only toxic at high levels that take time to accumulate and can be removed through partial water changes or aquatic plant life.</p>
<p>The desired species of nitrifying bacteria are present everywhere (e.g., in the air), therefore, once you have an ammonia source in your tank, its only a matter of time before the desired bacteria establish a colony in your filter bed. The most common way to do this is to seed your new aquarium using water or substrate from and existing aquarium, live rock or to place one or two (emphasis on one or two) hardy and inexpensive fish in your aquarium (damselfish and chromis are good for this purpose). The fish waste contains the ammonia on which the bacteria will live and grow, be careful not to overfeed them, causing more ammonia than can be handled by the growing bacteria bed.</p>
<h2>New Tank Syndrome</h2>
<p>During the cycling process, ammonia levels will vary wildly as the nitrite-forming bacteria take hold. Because nitrate-forming bacteria don't even begin to appear until nitrite is present in significant quantities, nitrite levels skyrocket (as the built-up ammonia is converted), continuing to rise as the continually-produced ammonia is converted to nitrite. Once the nitrate-forming bacteria take hold, nitrite levels fall, nitrate levels rise, and the tank is fully cycled.</p>
<h2>When is a new tank ready for fish?</h2>
<p>Your tank is fully cycled once nitrates are being produced (and ammonia and nitrite levels are zero). To determine when the cycle has completed, you will need to have a marine water test kit, and measure the levels weekly at first and then monthly. Another possibility is to bring water samples to your local fish store and let them perform the test for you. The cycling process normally takes anywhere from 2-6 weeks, at temperatures below 70F it takes even longer to cycle a tank. In comparison to other types of bacteria, nitrifying bacteria grow slowly. Under optimal conditions; however, it can take only 15 hours for a colony to double in size! It is possible to speed up the cycling process by using bacteria based products available that will speed the process of building the nitrifying bacteria beds. The use of these products along with proper temperature, water flow and lighting can shorten the cycling process to 1-3 weeks. Reverse Osmose water should be used to limit the amount of ammonia, nitrite and silicates that are present in the water.</p>
<h2>Don't Rush It!</h2>
<p>Warning: AVOID THE TEMPTATION TO GET MORE FISH UNTIL AFTER YOUR TANK HAS FULLY CYCLED! More fish means more ammonia production, increasing the stress on all fish and the likelihood of fish deaths. Once ammonia levels reach highly stressful or toxic levels, your tank has succumbed to New Tank Syndrome; the tank has not yet fully cycled, and the accumulating ammonia has concentrations lethal to your fish. Each time you add a couple of fish you will need to allow a couple of weeks for the bacteria in your aquarium filter bed to grow in number to handle the increased amount of ammonia and filtering loads. Keep in mind that not only are you adding more fish, but you are also increasing the amount of food fed, consumed and the amount of uneated food, all of which creates higher ammonia levels.</p>
<h2>How Much Ammonia Is Too Much?</h2>
<p>In an established tank ammonia levels should always be 0 ppm, which is undetectable using standard test kits available at stores. The presence of detectable levels indicates that your bio filter is not working adequately, either because your tank has not yet been completely cycled, or the filter is not functioning adequately (e.g. too small for fish load, clogged, etc.) It is imperative that you address the cause of the problem (filter) in addition to the symptoms (high ammonia levels).</p>
<p>The exact concentration at which ammonia becomes toxic to fish varies among species; some are more tolerant than others. In addition, other factors like water temperature and chemistry play a significant role. For example, ammonia (NH3) continually changes to ammonium (NH4+) and vice versa, with the relative concentrations of each depending on the water's temperature and pH. Ammonia is extremely toxic; ammonium is relatively harmless. At higher temperatures and pH, more of the nitrogen is in the toxic ammonia form than at lower pH.</p>

<h2>Speeding Up Cycling Time</h2>
</p>
<p>The nitrogen cycle can be sped up or jump started in a number of ways. Unfortunately, they require access to an established tank, which a beginning aquarist may not have available. The basic idea is to find an established tank, take some of the bacteria out of it and place them in the new tank. Most filters have some sort of foam block or floss insert on which nitrifying bacteria attach. Borrowing all or part of such an insert and placing it in the new tanks filter gets things going more quickly. If the established tank uses an undergravel filter, nitrifying bacteria will be attached to the gravel. Take some of the gravel (a cup or more) and hang it in a mesh bag in your filter (if you can), or lay it over the top of the gravel in the new tank (if it has an UGF).</p>

<h2>In conclusion</h2>
</p>
<p>More recently, products containing colonies of nitrifying bacteria have become available at pet shops (e.g. Fritz, Bio-zyme, Cycle). In theory, adding the bacteria jump-starts the colonization process as above. Net experience with such products has been mixed; some folks report success, while others report they don't work as well as advertised. In principle, such products should work well. However, nitrifying bacteria cannot live indefinitely without oxygen and food. Thus, the effectiveness of a product depends on its freshness and can be adversely effected by poor handling (e.g. overheating). Unfortunately, these products dont come with a freshness date, so there is no way to know how old they are.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many variations on the above that work. However, it is a bit difficult to give an exact recipe that is guaranteed to work. It is advisable to take a conservative approach and not add fish too quickly. In addition, testing the water to be sure nitrates are being produced eliminates the guesswork of determining when your tank has cycled. Remember that using any method to cycle your tank is going to take some time and that following the advice written here along with some patience and diligent water testing, will in the end result in a well established and enjoyable marine aquarium.</p> 5 publish 2014-09-12 22:13:00 2014-09-12 22:13:00 2014-09-12 22:24:05 jhooper 1 0 0
5 Introduction to Acropora Corals in the Home Reef Aquarium introduction-to-acropora-corals-in-the-home-reef-aquarium <p>Introduction to Acropora Corals gives marine reef aquarium hobbyists an overview of Acropora Corals especially as it relates to keeping them in the home aquarium environment.</p>
<p><img src="/images/corals/article3_acropora3.jpg" width="375" height="300" /></p> <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Acropora corals are highly adaptive, opportunistic and fast growing, which has made them a very popular species in reef aquarium hobby. Acropora can be found in a variety of grow forms ranging from plates to staghorns and a variety of colors. With the popularity and variety of this coral an entire website could be dedicated to their selection and husbandry. However, this guide will introduce the various varieties of Acropora and will cover their scientific background and information related to Acropora within the context of the reef aquarium hobby environment.</p>
<p><img src="/images/corals/article3_acropora1.jpg" width="375" height="300" /></p>
<h2>Scientific Information</h2>
<p>Genus Acropora (ak-roh-pohr-ah) is part of the largest family and most important contributor to coral reef formations in the world. The two primary genera Acropora and Montipora together account for almost one-third of all hermatypic or reef-building coral species. While found in both the pacific and atlantic oceans, Acropora is far more dominantly found in the Pacific ocean as there are only 3 known species of Acropora in the Atlantic. Acropora contain specialized axial corallite, which do not contain zooxanthellae, but allow for a very rapid growth rate, as they are fed by other areas of the colony. This allows for the genus to have a advantage over other corals in that they can outgrow them and rapidly colonize the reef. These fast growing Acropora branches can be identified by their light-colored tips, which are almost white or brightly hued.</p>
<p><img src="/images/corals/article3_acropora2.jpg" width="375" height="300" /></p>
<h2>About Acropora Corals</h2>
<p>There are 13 to 15 basic growth forms of Acropora that vary according to size and shape of the branches, the position of the brances, the number of corallite septa and the nature of the coenosteum. The most commonly available aquarium species tend to fall into the following growth forms: branching, bushy, cluster, finger, bottlebrush and tabular. In the aquarium hobby , species are generally sold by form and color as oppossed to the species i.e. purple staghorn or pink bottlebrush. This is understandable, but can make it difficult in providing a species designation, which is then left upto the aquarist.</p>
<p>Acropora are highly diverse and adaptable, which makes figuring out the best aquarium conditions difficult. Specimens have been collected in a multitude of areas including areas of strong water current and intense lighting to deep water areas and calm lagoons. Pretty much anywhere coral reefs can be found, Acropora can also be found there thriving. Discussed in the next section, growth forms and not species are probably the better indicator of the natural location of the coral. Coloration of Acropora is even more diverse than the growth forms, with almost every hue of the rainbow possible.</p>
<p><img src="/images/corals/article3_acropora5.jpg" width="375" height="300" /></p>
<h2>Acropora Corals in the Home Reef Aquarium</h2>
<p>Acropora in the wild are highly adaptable and can exist in a variety of locations including: calm lagoons, pounding reef crests and even reef flats where they can be out of water for periods of time. They tolerate huge differences in light intensity, water movement and even salinity, thus one would think that they would extremely easy to keep in the reef aquarium, but nothing could be further from the truth. In fact they are very demanding of their conditions when housed in captivity. However, once they are acclimated to aquarium life, and if kept with stable water conditions, they will also thrive in the reef aquarium.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Acropora species with thick branches are normally more difficult to keep than those with thin branches. This is most likely because of the inability of reef aquarists to provide enough water flow that the thick branched species need to thrive, thus making these species more prone initially to problems. Brown specimens, bottlebrush and thin branched species tend to be more tolerant of the lower water flow and light level conditions. Tabletop species are among the most difficult Acropora species to keep in the home reef aquarium, with staghorn specimens being somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p><img src="/images/corals/article3_acropora7.jpg" width="375" height="300" /></p>
<p>Captive-bred or frag specimens seem to be generally healthier and easier to care for than wild specimens. Nonetheless, all Acropora specimens seem to prefer strong, random or mixing type water current with intense lighting and high levels of calcium and strontium to promote maximum growth and health. Water quality should also be excellent and very stable, thus Acropora do much better in established reef aquariums where water parameters are generally more stable.</p>
<p><img src="/images/corals/article3_acropora8.jpg" width="375" height="300" /></p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>Acropora need to be acclimated carefully to their new surroundings so that they are not shocked by light, water parameter changes or other stresses. They should also be located in their final position as quickly as possibly to avoid stress or unfulfilled metabolic needs. Typical stressors include: low light, low water current and frequent movement from different positions in the aquarium. They do not tolerate sudden changes in aquarium conditions, especially water temperature and will fade in color, recede in growth or even die if proper water conditions are not maintained. While frag or captive-bred species do best, they often require about 6 months to regain full normal growth rates. Acropora are also susceptible to most known coral diseases including: white-band disease, black-band disease, recession, etc. While Acropora are a demanding species to keep in captivity, it is possible to keep them successfully and can be an extremely rewarding coral to keep and raise. Hopefully the information in this article along with the experience obtained from keeping corals in the reef aquarium will help increase the likelyhood that these corals can not only be kept successfully in the reef aquarium, but also thrive as well.</p> 5 publish 2014-09-12 22:39:00 2014-09-12 22:39:00 2014-09-12 23:04:47 jhooper 1 acropora coral hermatpic montipora reef staghorn 0 0
6 Acclimating Corals to the marine reef aquarium acclimating-corals-to-the-marine-reef-aquarium <p><img src="/images/blog/coralAcclimation1.jpg" width="550" /></p>
<p>This Hobbyist Guide focuses on the steps a hobbyist should take to safely add a marine coral to their reef aquarium. The recommended steps are clearly laid out, so that a hobbyist of any level will benefit from this guide. Notes and warnings are included for areas that require special attention or are common areas where new hobbyists typically make mistakes.</p> <h2>Why we need to Acclimate Corals</h2>
<p>The vast majority of aquarium hobbyists strive to provide the best possible environment and care for all of their aquariums inhabitants. It is because of this attention to excellent husbandry, that collectively as a hobby, reef aquarists have learned the best methods in which to introduce and maintain corals within the aquarium environment. There is probably no more critical time for a coral than during the process of being transported home and introduced into the hobbyists reef aquarium. During this period of time the coral will be subjected to many stresses, that while inevitable, can be greatly reduced through the care and technique that the marine aquarium hobbyist uses to introduce the new coral into its new home. In order to safely acclimate Corals into an already established aquarium it is important to closely follow this proven set of procedures designed to limit any stress on the new specimen and get it acclimated as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/coralAcclimation2.jpg" width="550" /></p>
<p>It is highly recommended to look over all the steps ahead of time and be sure to have all the necesarry items handy and ready to go prior to the arrival of the new coral specimen. This acclimation procedure is a safe and easy way to introduce Corals from the relatively stressful water chemistry of its shipping bag to the healthy and safe conditions of its new home. Though it may seem like the best course of action is to get your new specimen into your clean aquarium as soon as possible, it is extremely important to note that rapid changes in water conditions or chemistry can be more dangerous to an aquatic animal than being kept longer in an unhealthy environment. It is this slow transition from shipping container to established tank that is the focus of this acclimation procedure.</p>
<p>Note: It is generally recommended that all newly purchased specimens be quarantined in a separate tank before introduction to the population of your established aquarium; however, the acclimation process is the same either way (assuming the quarantine tank has the same water chemistry as the main aquarium).</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/coralAcclimation3.jpg" width="550" /></p>
<h2>Acclimating corals into an established reef aquarium</h2>
<p>Note: This procedure should not take any more than 1 hour to complete.</p>
<p>Important Note: Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium.</p>
<p>Before you start, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li type="disc">Non-abrasive net</li>
<li type="disc">Plastic or glass cup</li>
<li type="disc">Clean plastic or glass container to keep the specimen during the acclimation process</li>
<li type="disc">A means to access water from your aquarium</li>
<li type="disc">Aquarium Thermometer</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps to take to properly acclimate a new Coral specimen</p>
<ul>
<li type="disc">Open the bag or shipping container and carefully place coral with the water from the bag into the empty bucket or container.</li>
<li type="disc">Add 1 cup of your aquarium water to the bucket slowly.</li>
<li type="disc">Repeat this process adding 1 cup of aquarium water every 5 minutes for 30 minutes.</li>
<li type="disc">Dim or turn off the aquarium lights to help minimize stress on the new coral.</li>
<li type="disc">Carefully remove the coral or clam from the bucket. Be extremely careful when handling live corals not to touch the delicate flesh of the animals. Try to handle the corals only by their hard skeletons or the plug or coral rubble that they are attached to whenever possible.</li>
<li type="disc">Place your new coral in a location within your reef community that will not place the newly introduced specimens too close to other well established or aggressive species, as they will sting their new competitors. Check on compatibility issues to see where your new coral should be placed in its new home. Remember that many aggressive coral species extend their sweeper tentacles mainly at night, so what may seem to be a peaceful environment during daylight hours may not be once the lights go out.</li>
<li type="disc">Discard the water left in the bucket. EXCEPTION: Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium.</li>
<li type="disc">Keep the aquarium lights off or at a low level and gradually work up to a higher level, allowing the coral(s) time to adjust before returning lighting to full operating levels. This process should ideally occur over a 2 to 3 hour period.</li>
<li type="disc">At this time your coral species will be ready to coexist with its fellow tank mates.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/blog/coralAcclimation4.jpg" width="550" /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By following these steps a reef aquarium hobbyist of any level should be able to properly acclimate a new coral specimen to their established reef aquarium. It is also recommended that the aquarium hobbyist pay close attention to their new coral specimen(s) during acclimation and in the short term afterwords to verify that the coral is doing well and taking to its new environment.</p>
<p>Helpful Hints:</p>
<ul>
<li type="disc">When Acclimating corals, begin with a low level of lighting and gradually work up to a higher level, allowing the coral(s) time to adjust before lighting increases.</li>
<li type="disc">Never introduce an airstone or any other form of aeration into the shipping bag. Aerating the water inside the shipping bag will only convert non-toxic ammonia to a toxic form that will be extremely harmful to the animal.</li>
<li type="disc">Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium. THESE SPECIES MUST BE KEPT UNDER WATER AT ALL TIMES.</li>
<li type="disc">Do not be too anxious to admire your new specimen. Allow them to adjust to their new home before you expose them to bright lights and attention.</li>

8 Wet/Dry Filtration Systems wetdry-filtration-systems Biological, mechanical and chemical filtration for the freshwater or marine aquarium <p><img src="http://www.aquariumdomain.com/images/blog/wetdry1.jpg" width="500" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" /></p>
<p>Wet/Dry filtration has become one of the corner stones of a well designed aquarium filtration system. Along with the general aspects of Wet/Dry filtration, this guide covers all of the benefits of this type of system including biological filtration, mechanical filtration, water oxygenation, chemical filtration and sump configurations. From the basic Wet/Dry filter to the more recent advancements in these filter systems, this guide bring the aquarium hobbyist up-to-speed on this very desirable aquarium filtration system.</p> <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Wet/Dry filtration is a method of filtration that focuses on providing biological, mechanical and chemical filtration for both marine and freshwater aquariums. Wet/Dry filters get their name because they take water from the aquarium via an overflow system and pass the water through the air over a series of porous bio-material which is usually in the form of plastic bio-balls. While this process gives the filter system its name, the modern Wet/Dry filter system does much more. While the primary task of a Wet/Dry filter is to provide biological filtration, it is also an excellent filter for both mechanical and chemical filtration as well. After siphoning the water from the aquarium via a skimmer or overflow system, the water is passed through one or more chambers containing filter pads or sponges, where mechanical filtration takes place as physical particles are removed from the water stream before they enter the trickle tower portion of the Wet/Dry filter. It is at this point that the water is passed into the trickle tower or bio-chamber where it drops down onto plastic bio-balls that are piled up on top of a plastic grate at the bottom of the chamber. This allows the water to pass through the air as it drips through the bio-ball chamber which creates an ideal environment for beneficial aerobic bacteria to live.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.aquariumdomain.com/images/blog/wetdry2.jpg" width="500" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" /></p>
<p>It is these aerobic bacteria living on the bio-balls that perform the biological filtering of the water as they remove waste products from the water and produce oxygen. At this point the water drops down into the main sump area of the Wet/Dry Filter system, where chemical filtration can be added along with other filtration devices such as protein skimmers, activated carbon media and much more. Lastly, the water moves into the final chamber which contains the pump to return the water from the Wet/Dry filter sump back into the aquarium. Since Wet/Dry filters excel at biological filtration, they have become one of the most important ingredients to a successful aquarium filtration system. Biological filtration is the process in which ammonia is converted to the less toxic nitrite, then to the relatively non-toxic nitrate. While nitrate is non-toxic at low levels, it can build up over time and become toxic to most aquarium inhabitants. Nitrate will need to be removed from the aquarium system either through the use of live plants which consume nitrate as food or from water changes where aquarium water is removed and replaced with fresh water that is from a nitrate free source.</p>
<h2>Biological</h2>
<p>Wet/Dry systems earned their reputation as excellent biological filters by the method by which they stimulate bacterial growth. A successful bacteria colony requires moisture, heat and oxygen, all of which are effectively cultivated in properly maintained Wet/Dry filter systems. The temperature of your tank will provide the necessary heat for proper growth, and the moisture is taken care of by the water in your tank. The process of how the water is siphoned from the aquarium surface and trickled over the biological surface is how the Wet/Dry does the rest by providing the correct environment and living conditions for billions upon billions of beneficial aerobic bacteria colonies to live and thrive. Each Wet/Dry filter uses its own type and grade of bio material. Most filters use bio-balls, which are spherical plastic balls which are hollow and have a netted structure that provides large amounts of surface area for beneficial bacteria to live. Other Wet/Dry filter designs use a structure called Bio Bale, which looks like plastic hay, which is also very effective at stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria. New versions of bio-material and Wet/Dry configurations are popping up within the hobby as filter manufacturers look to further improve on what is already a very effective design.</p>

<h2>Oxygenation</h2>
<p>The initial process of skimming the water from the aquariums surface and returning it via the surface of the water creates excellent water agitation which saturates the water with large amounts of dissolved oxygen. On top of this process, when the water enters the Wet/Dry filter from your tank, it is poured over the biomaterial at a high velocity, as the water flows over the material it mixes with the surrounding air, supersaturating the water with oxygen. It is this mixing affect that contributes to the name Wet/Dry filtration. There are even opportunities within the sump portion of the Wet/Dry filter itself for oxygen to be introduced into the water via the return from a device such as a protein skimmer or by passing over additional filter media or substrates where more beneficial bacteria may be present.</p>
<p>While all models of Wet/Dry filters have mechanical filtration via pre-filters in the skimmer box to filtration trays located above the bio material, newer model Wet/Dry filters are constantly improving on this by providing more physical filtration in the form of micro mesh bags, sponge filters and media pads located in various locations throughout the filter system. Any of the Wet/Dry filter systems commonly available within the aquarium hobby provide not only excellent biological filtration, but top notch mechanical filtration as well. Additional mechanical filtration would only be necessary in the most extreme of cases where the aquarium inhabitants produce large amounts of physical waste.</p>
<h2>The Sump</h2>
<p>The sump area of the Wet/Dry filter system allows the hobbyist a convenient location to locate chemical filtration, protein skimmers, live rock (saltwater setup), plants, macro algae and much more. It is now quite common for Wet/Dry filter systems to come with expanded sump sections to allow hobbyists to keep a variety of additional filters and even create refugiums and plant based vegetable filters. All of these additional forms of filtration make the Wet/Dry filter a complete all-in-one filtration system that is capable of handling all types of marine or freshwater aquarium setups.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.aquariumdomain.com/images/blog/wetdry4.jpg" width="500" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wet/Dry filtratioin systems are not simply a good option to consider, it has become the ideal starting point for a high quality filtration system that excels in both freshwater and saltwater aquarium installations. Due to their popularity, they have expanded with many different variations of the standard Wet/Dry system with expanded sumps, refugiums, Berlin style setups and many more. Be sure to carefully investigate your options when setting up your next aquarium and find the right Wet/Dry system to fit your aquarium goals.</p> 5 publish 2014-10-21 23:50:00 2014-10-21 23:50:00 2014-10-22 00:02:47 adog 1 and biological chemical filtration mechanical systemstion wet_dry 0 0
9 Tank Tours :: Doug's 50 Gallon Reef Aquarium tank-tours-dougs-50-gallon-reef-aquarium Tank Tours :: Episode 1 <p><img src="/images/blog/TankTours/Doug54/tank1.jpg" width="600" height="377" /></p>
<h2>About the Aquarium</h2>
<p>Welcome to Tank Tours! This edition features Doug's 50 gallon Oceanic reef aquarium. The main aquarium contains around 75lbs of live rock, a 1 inch deep sand bed and internal water flow provided by a pair of Hydor powerheads on a controller providing intermittent laminar water flow. The external support system consists of a hang on the back CPR refugium, custom built 10 gallon sump with trickle tower wet/dry filter and E-Shoppes protein skimmer.</p> <p><img src="/images/blog/TankTours/Doug54/tank2.jpg" width="600" height="450" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" /></p>

<h2>Aquarium Support Systems</h2>
<p>Doug has been running his aquarium for about 2 years and has really maximized the space of his 36" x 18" x 21" aquarium to provide an interesting mix of corals, invertebrates and reef safe fish species. A single continuous rocky reef consisting of multiple caves and crevices provides a home to variety of corals and fish species. His tank supports multiple fast growing corals species that will prove challenging over time as they expand over the live rock and come into contact with one another. With excellent laminar internal water flow and strong reef lighting, all of the corals are thriving. In addition to proper water flow, another critical aspect to long term success revolves around nutrient export. Doug is using an external refugium growing both Chaetomorpha Algae and Caulerpa seaweed. By growing and harvesting marine plants and algae and bi-weekly water changes, Doug has been able to keep his nutrient levels low and maintain an aquarium free of nuisance algae and low dissolved nutrients. Lighting consists of three Reef capable Marineland LED lighting systems, which combined provide approximately 9000 lumen of illumination. The support system is completed with a pair of Hagen 300 watt heaters. It is important to note that multiple heaters are always recommended as they provide redundancy in case of failure, which can be critical in colder climates or where the room ambient temperature is much less than the internal aquarium temperature.</p>

<h2>Fish Livestock and Invertebrates</h2>
<p>With the relative close quarters of a 50 gallon 3 foot long aquarium and a variety of coral species, this aquarium has a diverse group of reef safe fish species that would both get along with each other and also not harm any of the corals. Currently situated in the rear left hand corner of the aquarium is a Purple Long Tentacle Anemone which is hosting a mated pair of Black Ocellaris Clownfish. The overall aquarium conditions combined with a host anemone has prompted the Clownfish pair to spawn multiple times over the past year. Elsewhere in the aquarium a Kole Tang and Lemon Peel Angelfish patrol the entirety of reef grazing on algae and moving in and out of the rocky caves and larger rock crevices. Small schools of Yellowtail Blue Damselfish and Green Reef Chromis provide plenty of swimming activity within the aquarium. The fish livestock is rounded out by a combination of a Candy Cane Wrasse, Spotted Mandarin Dragonet and Sailfin Blenny, who move throughout the reef feeding on algae, copepods and other small invertebrate organisms. It isn't always easy to provide a diverse selection of fish that will not only get along with one another in a 3 foot long aquarium, but also not adversely affect any of the live corals living on the reef; however, Doug has been able to achieve this delicate balance within his aquarium.</p>

<h2>Corals</h2>
<p>As this is the first marine aquarium Doug has kept, he was smart to choose a variety of coral species that are fairly easy to keep. However, despite choosing beginner friendly corals species Doug has done a truly amazing job with his first marine aquarium. Simply choosing a reef aquarium as your first marine aquarium is quite ambitious, but to have put together a diverse combination of corals and reef fish and maintained them in a thriving aquarium is a testament to what a great job Doug has done with his first saltwater aquarium. The combination of fish live stock along with encrusting corals, polyp corals, mushroom corals and soft corals make this 50 gallon reef aquarium a beautiful and well balanced tank. All of these corals do well in aquariums with moderate, laminar water flow and medium intensity lighting, which fits well with the existing Marineland LED's and Hydor wave maker controlled powerheads.</p>

<h2>Thanks for viewing Tank Tours Episode 1</h2>
<p>The challenges moving forward for Doug will be to continue to provide excellent water conditions as all of his fish live stock mature and to provide adequate space on the reef for his ever growing corals and sessile invertebrates. Hopefully the success of his first aquarium will encourage Doug to look at a larger aquarium that will allow him to try his hand at keeping a wider variety of fish and corals. Thanks for taking a look at this edition of Tank Tours!</p> 5 publish 2014-11-03 22:34:00 2014-11-03 22:34:00 2014-11-03 23:09:07 adog 1 0 0
10 Paradise Gourami (Macropodus opercularis) species profile added paradise-gourami-macropodus-opercularis-species-profile-added <p><img src="http://www.aquariumdomain.com/images/fish_freshwater/ParadiseGourami4.jpg" width="375" height="300" /></p> <p><span class="mainText">The Paradise Gourami (Macropodus opercularis) is one of the more brightly colored members of the group of fish known as Labyrinth fish. Labyrinth fish have a special lung-like labyrinth organ which allows them to breath air from the surface of the water. It is important to note that Labyrinth fish are not born with functional labyrinth organs and instead development the organ as they grow older. Thus young labyrinth fish breathe entirely with their gills and require proper amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water to survive. Paradise Gourami are an incredibly adaptable species that can survive under hypoxic (oxygen-deprived) conditions and over a wide temperature range. However, they do prefer still to slow-moving waterways ranging from ponds, irrigation ditches and marshes to slow moving streams and backwaters of larger rivers. This flexibility has allowed the Paradise Gourami to thrive over a considerable natural range covering southeast China, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea. Introduced populations also exist in Madagascar and the USA. </span></p>

Their native habitats also range from areas with substrates covered in leaves, branches and tree roots to areas with clear water, sandy substrates and dense growth of aquatic and bog plants. Despite still being collected in the wild, their immense popularity within the aquarium hobby has led to extensive breeding programs that breed large numbers of specimens for the commercial trade.</p>

0 JOIN 28 MySQL supports the following JOIN syntax for the table_references part
of SELECT statements and multiple-table DELETE and UPDATE statements:

table_references:
    escaped_table_reference [, escaped_table_reference] ...

escaped_table_reference:
    table_reference
  | { OJ table_reference }

table_reference:
    table_factor
  | join_table

table_factor:
    tbl_name [[AS] alias] [index_hint_list]
  | table_subquery [AS] alias
  | ( table_references )

join_table:
    table_reference [INNER | CROSS] JOIN table_factor [join_condition]
  | table_reference STRAIGHT_JOIN table_factor
  | table_reference STRAIGHT_JOIN table_factor ON conditional_expr
  | table_reference {LEFT|RIGHT} [OUTER] JOIN table_reference join_condition
  | table_reference NATURAL [{LEFT|RIGHT} [OUTER]] JOIN table_factor

join_condition:
    ON conditional_expr
  | USING (column_list)

index_hint_list:
    index_hint [, index_hint] ...

index_hint:
    USE {INDEX|KEY}
      [FOR {JOIN|ORDER BY|GROUP BY}] ([index_list])
  | IGNORE {INDEX|KEY}
      [FOR {JOIN|ORDER BY|GROUP BY}] (index_list)
  | FORCE {INDEX|KEY}
      [FOR {JOIN|ORDER BY|GROUP BY}] (index_list)

index_list:
    index_name [, index_name] ...

A table reference is also known as a join expression.

The syntax of table_factor is extended in MySQL in comparison with
standard SQL. The standard accepts only table_reference, not a list of
them inside a pair of parentheses.

This is a conservative extension if each comma in a list of
table_reference items is considered as equivalent to an inner join. For
example:

SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2, t3, t4)
                 ON (t2.a = t1.a AND t3.b = t1.b AND t4.c = t1.c)

is equivalent to:

SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2 CROSS JOIN t3 CROSS JOIN t4)
                 ON (t2.a = t1.a AND t3.b = t1.b AND t4.c = t1.c)

In MySQL, JOIN, CROSS JOIN, and INNER JOIN are syntactic equivalents
(they can replace each other). In standard SQL, they are not
equivalent. INNER JOIN is used with an ON clause, CROSS JOIN is used
otherwise.

In general, parentheses can be ignored in join expressions containing
only inner join operations. MySQL also supports nested joins. See
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/nested-join-optimization.html.

Index hints can be specified to affect how the MySQL optimizer makes
use of indexes. For more information, see
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/index-hints.html. The
optimizer_switch system variable is another way to influence optimizer
use of indexes. See
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/switchable-optimizations.html.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/join.html SELECT left_tbl.*
  FROM left_tbl LEFT JOIN right_tbl ON left_tbl.id = right_tbl.id
  WHERE right_tbl.id IS NULL; http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/join.html
1 HEX 38 Syntax:
HEX(str), HEX(N)

For a string argument str, HEX() returns a hexadecimal string
representation of str where each byte of each character in str is
converted to two hexadecimal digits. (Multibyte characters therefore
become more than two digits.) The inverse of this operation is
performed by the UNHEX() function.

For a numeric argument N, HEX() returns a hexadecimal string
representation of the value of N treated as a longlong (BIGINT) number.
This is equivalent to CONV(N,10,16). The inverse of this operation is
performed by CONV(HEX(N),16,10).

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/string-functions.html mysql> SELECT X'616263', HEX('abc'), UNHEX(HEX('abc'));
        -> 'abc', 616263, 'abc'
mysql> SELECT HEX(255), CONV(HEX(255),16,10);
        -> 'FF', 255 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/string-functions.html
2 CONTAINS 7 Contains(g1, g2)

Returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether g1 completely contains g2. This
tests the opposite relationship as Within().

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html
3 SRID 37 SRID(g)

Returns an integer indicating the spatial reference system ID
associated with the geometry value g.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/gis-general-property-functions.html mysql> SELECT SRID(GeomFromText('LineString(1 1,2 2)',101));

4 SHOW CONTRIBUTORS 27 Syntax:
SHOW CONTRIBUTORS

The SHOW CONTRIBUTORS statement displays information about the people
who contribute to MySQL source or to causes that we support. For each
contributor, it displays Name, Location, and Comment values.

This statement is deprecated as of MySQL 5.5.29 and is removed in MySQL
5.6.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/show-contributors.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/show-contributors.html
5 VARIANCE 16 Syntax:
VARIANCE(expr)

Returns the population standard variance of expr. VARIANCE() is a
synonym for the standard SQL function VAR_POP(), provided as a MySQL
extension.

If there are no matching rows, VARIANCE() returns NULL.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/group-by-functions.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/group-by-functions.html
6 DROP SERVER 40 Syntax:
DROP SERVER [ IF EXISTS ] server_name

Drops the server definition for the server named server_name. The
corresponding row in the mysql.servers table is deleted. This statement
requires the SUPER privilege.

Dropping a server for a table does not affect any FEDERATED tables that
used this connection information when they were created. See [HELP
CREATE SERVER].

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/drop-server.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/drop-server.html
7 SHOW AUTHORS 27 Syntax:
SHOW AUTHORS

The SHOW AUTHORS statement displays information about the people who
work on MySQL. For each author, it displays Name, Location, and Comment
values.

This statement is deprecated as of MySQL 5.5.29 and is removed in MySQL
5.6.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/show-authors.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/show-authors.html
8 CONCAT 38 Syntax:
CONCAT(str1,str2,...)

Returns the string that results from concatenating the arguments. May
have one or more arguments. If all arguments are nonbinary strings, the
result is a nonbinary string. If the arguments include any binary
strings, the result is a binary string. A numeric argument is converted
to its equivalent nonbinary string form.

CONCAT() returns NULL if any argument is NULL.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/string-functions.html mysql> SELECT CONCAT('My', 'S', 'QL');
        -> 'MySQL'
mysql> SELECT CONCAT('My', NULL, 'QL');
        -> NULL
mysql> SELECT CONCAT(14.3);
        -> '14.3' http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/string-functions.html
9 GEOMETRY HIERARCHY 35 Geometry is the base class. It is an abstract class. The instantiable
subclasses of Geometry are restricted to zero-, one-, and
two-dimensional geometric objects that exist in two-dimensional
coordinate space. All instantiable geometry classes are defined so that
valid instances of a geometry class are topologically closed (that is,
all defined geometries include their boundary).

The base Geometry class has subclasses for Point, Curve, Surface, and
GeometryCollection:

o Point represents zero-dimensional objects.

o Curve represents one-dimensional objects, and has subclass
  LineString, with sub-subclasses Line and LinearRing.

o Surface is designed for two-dimensional objects and has subclass
  Polygon.

o GeometryCollection has specialized zero-, one-, and two-dimensional
  collection classes named MultiPoint, MultiLineString, and
  MultiPolygon for modeling geometries corresponding to collections of
  Points, LineStrings, and Polygons, respectively. MultiCurve and
  MultiSurface are introduced as abstract superclasses that generalize
  the collection interfaces to handle Curves and Surfaces.

Geometry, Curve, Surface, MultiCurve, and MultiSurface are defined as
noninstantiable classes. They define a common set of methods for their
subclasses and are included for extensibility.

Point, LineString, Polygon, GeometryCollection, MultiPoint,
MultiLineString, and MultiPolygon are instantiable classes.

90 LOCATE 38 Syntax:
LOCATE(substr,str), LOCATE(substr,str,pos)

The first syntax returns the position of the first occurrence of
substring substr in string str. The second syntax returns the position
of the first occurrence of substring substr in string str, starting at
position pos. Returns 0 if substr is not in str. Returns NULL if substr
or str is NULL.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/string-functions.html mysql> SELECT LOCATE('bar', 'foobarbar');
        -> 4
mysql> SELECT LOCATE('xbar', 'foobar');
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT LOCATE('bar', 'foobarbar', 5);
        -> 7 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/string-functions.html
91 SHOW EVENTS 27 Syntax:
SHOW EVENTS
    [{FROM | IN} schema_name]
    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]

This statement displays information about Event Manager events, which
are discussed in
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/event-scheduler.html. It
requires the EVENT privilege for the database from which the events are
to be shown.

In its simplest form, SHOW EVENTS lists all of the events in the
current schema:

mysql> SELECT CURRENT_USER(), SCHEMA();
+----------------+----------+
| CURRENT_USER() | SCHEMA() |
+----------------+----------+
| jon@ghidora    | myschema |
+----------------+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SHOW EVENTS\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                  Db: myschema
                Name: e_daily
             Definer: jon@ghidora
           Time zone: SYSTEM
                Type: RECURRING
          Execute at: NULL
      Interval value: 1
      Interval field: DAY

          Originator: 1
character_set_client: utf8
collation_connection: utf8_general_ci
  Database Collation: latin1_swedish_ci

To see events for a specific schema, use the FROM clause. For example,
to see events for the test schema, use the following statement:

SHOW EVENTS FROM test;

The LIKE clause, if present, indicates which event names to match. The
WHERE clause can be given to select rows using more general conditions,
as discussed in
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/extended-show.html.

92 LONGTEXT 23 LONGTEXT [CHARACTER SET charset_name] [COLLATE collation_name]

A TEXT column with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 or 4GB (232 ? 1)
characters. The effective maximum length is less if the value contains
multibyte characters. The effective maximum length of LONGTEXT columns
also depends on the configured maximum packet size in the client/server
protocol and available memory. Each LONGTEXT value is stored using a
4-byte length prefix that indicates the number of bytes in the value.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/string-type-overview.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/string-type-overview.html
93 KILL 27 Syntax:
KILL [CONNECTION | QUERY] processlist_id

Each connection to mysqld runs in a separate thread. You can kill a
thread with the KILL processlist_id statement.

Thread processlist identifiers can be determined from the ID column of
the INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST table, the Id column of SHOW
PROCESSLIST output, and the PROCESSLIST_ID column of the Performance
Schema threads table. The value for the current thread is returned by
the CONNECTION_ID() function.

KILL permits an optional CONNECTION or QUERY modifier:

o KILL CONNECTION is the same as KILL with no modifier: It terminates
  the connection associated with the given processlist_id, after
  terminating any statement the connection is executing.

o KILL QUERY terminates the statement the connection is currently
  executing, but leaves the connection itself intact.

If you have the PROCESS privilege, you can see all threads. If you have
the SUPER privilege, you can kill all threads and statements.
Otherwise, you can see and kill only your own threads and statements.

You can also use the mysqladmin processlist and mysqladmin kill
commands to examine and kill threads.

*Note*:

You cannot use KILL with the Embedded MySQL Server library because the
embedded server merely runs inside the threads of the host application.
It does not create any connection threads of its own.

94 DISJOINT 7 Disjoint(g1, g2)

Returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether g1 is spatially disjoint from (does
not intersect) g2.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html
95 LPAD 38 Syntax:
LPAD(str,len,padstr)

Returns the string str, left-padded with the string padstr to a length
of len characters. If str is longer than len, the return value is
shortened to len characters.


URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/string-functions.html mysql> SELECT LPAD('hi',4,'??');
        -> '??hi'
mysql> SELECT LPAD('hi',1,'??');
        -> 'h' http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/string-functions.html
96 OVERLAPS 7 Overlaps(g1, g2)

Two geometries spatially overlap if they intersect and their
intersection results in a geometry of the same dimension but not equal
to either of the given geometries.

This function returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether g1 spatially overlaps
g2.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html
97 SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER 8 Syntax:
SET GLOBAL sql_slave_skip_counter = N

This statement skips the next N events from the master. This is useful
for recovering from replication stops caused by a statement.

This statement is valid only when the slave threads are not running.
Otherwise, it produces an error.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/set-global-sql-slave-skip-counter.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/set-global-sql-slave-skip-counter.html
98 MBREQUAL 7 MBREqual(g1, g2)

Returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether the minimum bounding rectangles of
the two geometries g1 and g2 are the same.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html
99 PROCEDURE ANALYSE 34 Syntax:
ANALYSE([max_elements[,max_memory]])

ANALYSE() examines the result from a query and returns an analysis of
the results that suggests optimal data types for each column that may
help reduce table sizes. To obtain this analysis, append PROCEDURE
ANALYSE to the end of a SELECT statement:

SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... PROCEDURE ANALYSE([max_elements,[max_memory]])

For example:

SELECT col1, col2 FROM table1 PROCEDURE ANALYSE(10, 2000);

The results show some statistics for the values returned by the query,
and propose an optimal data type for the columns. This can be helpful
for checking your existing tables, or after importing new data. You may
need to try different settings for the arguments so that PROCEDURE
ANALYSE() does not suggest the ENUM data type when it is not
appropriate.

The arguments are optional and are used as follows:

o max_elements (default 256) is the maximum number of distinct values
  that ANALYSE() notices per column. This is used by ANALYSE() to check
  whether the optimal data type should be of type ENUM; if there are
  more than max_elements distinct values, then ENUM is not a suggested
  type.

o max_memory (default 8192) is the maximum amount of memory that
  ANALYSE() should allocate per column while trying to find all
  distinct values.

A PROCEDURE clause is not permitted in a UNION statement.

ALTER TABLE changes the structure of a table. For example, you can add
or delete columns, create or destroy indexes, change the type of
existing columns, or rename columns or the table itself. You can also
change characteristics such as the storage engine used for the table or
the table comment.

o To use ALTER TABLE, you need ALTER, CREATE, and INSERT privileges for
  the table. Renaming a table requires ALTER and DROP on the old table,
  ALTER, CREATE, and INSERT on the new table.

o Following the table name, specify the alterations to be made. If none
  are given, ALTER TABLE does nothing.

o The syntax for many of the permissible alterations is similar to
  clauses of the CREATE TABLE statement. column_definition clauses use
  the same syntax for ADD and CHANGE as for CREATE TABLE. For more
  information, see [HELP CREATE TABLE].

o The word COLUMN is optional and can be omitted.

o Multiple ADD, ALTER, DROP, and CHANGE clauses are permitted in a
  single ALTER TABLE statement, separated by commas. This is a MySQL
  extension to standard SQL, which permits only one of each clause per
  ALTER TABLE statement. For example, to drop multiple columns in a
  single statement, do this:

ALTER TABLE t2 DROP COLUMN c, DROP COLUMN d;

o If a storage engine does not support an attempted ALTER TABLE
  operation, a warning may result. Such warnings can be displayed with
  SHOW WARNINGS. See [HELP SHOW WARNINGS]. For information on
  troubleshooting ALTER TABLE, see
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/alter-table-problems.html.

o For usage examples, see
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/alter-table-examples.html.

o With the mysql_info() C API function, you can find out how many rows
  were copied by ALTER TABLE, and (when IGNORE is used) how many rows
  were deleted due to duplication of unique key values. See
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql-info.html.

492 LABELS 24 Syntax:
[begin_label:] BEGIN
    [statement_list]
END [end_label]

[begin_label:] LOOP
    statement_list
END LOOP [end_label]

[begin_label:] REPEAT
    statement_list
UNTIL search_condition
END REPEAT [end_label]

[begin_label:] WHILE search_condition DO
    statement_list
END WHILE [end_label]

Labels are permitted for BEGIN ... END blocks and for the LOOP, REPEAT,
and WHILE statements. Label use for those statements follows these
rules:

o begin_label must be followed by a colon.

o begin_label can be given without end_label. If end_label is present,
  it must be the same as begin_label.

o end_label cannot be given without begin_label.

o Labels at the same nesting level must be distinct.

o Labels can be up to 16 characters long.

To refer to a label within the labeled construct, use an ITERATE or
LEAVE statement. The following example uses those statements to
continue iterating or terminate the loop:

CREATE PROCEDURE doiterate(p1 INT)
BEGIN
  label1: LOOP
    SET p1 = p1 + 1;
    IF p1 < 10 THEN ITERATE label1; END IF;
    LEAVE label1;
  END LOOP label1;
END;

The scope of a block label does not include the code for handlers
declared within the block. For details, see [HELP DECLARE HANDLER].

495 ANALYZE TABLE 21 Syntax:
ANALYZE [NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG | LOCAL]
    TABLE tbl_name [, tbl_name] ...

ANALYZE TABLE performs a key distribution analysis and stores the
distribution for the named table or tables. For MyISAM tables, this
statement is equivalent to using myisamchk --analyze.

This statement requires SELECT and INSERT privileges for the table.

ANALYZE TABLE works with InnoDB, NDB, and MyISAM tables. It does not
work with views.

ANALYZE TABLE is supported for partitioned tables, and you can use
ALTER TABLE ... ANALYZE PARTITION to analyze one or more partitions;
for more information, see [HELP ALTER TABLE], and
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/partitioning-maintenance.html.

During the analysis, the table is locked with a read lock for InnoDB
and MyISAM.

By default, the server writes ANALYZE TABLE statements to the binary
log so that they replicate to replication slaves. To suppress logging,
specify the optional NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG keyword or its alias LOCAL.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/analyze-table.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/analyze-table.html
496 FIELD 38 Syntax:
FIELD(str,str1,str2,str3,...)

Returns the index (position) of str in the str1, str2, str3, ... list.
Returns 0 if str is not found.

If all arguments to FIELD() are strings, all arguments are compared as
strings. If all arguments are numbers, they are compared as numbers.
Otherwise, the arguments are compared as double.

If str is NULL, the return value is 0 because NULL fails equality
comparison with any value. FIELD() is the complement of ELT().

497 CONSTRAINT 40 MySQL supports foreign keys, which let you cross-reference related data
across tables, and foreign key constraints, which help keep this
spread-out data consistent. The essential syntax for a foreign key
constraint definition in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement looks
like this:

[CONSTRAINT [symbol]] FOREIGN KEY
    [index_name] (col_name, ...)
    REFERENCES tbl_name (col_name,...)
    [ON DELETE reference_option]
    [ON UPDATE reference_option]

reference_option:
    RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION | SET DEFAULT

    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
      REFERENCES customer(id)
)   ENGINE=INNODB; http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-table-foreign-keys.html
498 ALTER TABLESPACE 40 Syntax:
ALTER TABLESPACE tablespace_name
    {ADD|DROP} DATAFILE 'file_name'
    [INITIAL_SIZE [=] size]
    [WAIT]
    ENGINE [=] engine_name

This statement can be used either to add a new data file, or to drop a
data file from a tablespace.

The ADD DATAFILE variant enables you to specify an initial size using
an INITIAL_SIZE clause, where size is measured in bytes; the default
value is 134217728 (128 MB). Prior to MySQL NDB Cluster 7.2.14, this
value was required to be specified using digits (Bug #13116514, Bug
#16104705, Bug #62858); in MySQL NDB Cluster 7.2.14 and later, you may
optionally follow size with a one-letter abbreviation for an order of
magnitude, similar to those used in my.cnf. Generally, this is one of
the letters M (megabytes) or G (gigabytes).

*Note*:

All NDB Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace. This means
that each Disk Data object must be uniquely named (and not merely each
Disk Data object of a given type). For example, you cannot have a
tablespace and an data file with the same name, or an undo log file and
a tablespace with the same name.

On 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for INITIAL_SIZE is
4294967296 (4 GB). (Bug #29186)

INITIAL_SIZE is rounded, explicitly, as for CREATE TABLESPACE.

Once a data file has been created, its size cannot be changed; however,
you can add more data files to the tablespace using additional ALTER
TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE statements.

Using DROP DATAFILE with ALTER TABLESPACE drops the data file
'file_name' from the tablespace. You cannot drop a data file from a
tablespace which is in use by any table; in other words, the data file
must be empty (no extents used). See
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects.
html. In addition, any data file to be dropped must previously have
been added to the tablespace with CREATE TABLESPACE or ALTER
TABLESPACE.

Both ALTER TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE and ALTER TABLESPACE ... DROP
DATAFILE require an ENGINE clause which specifies the storage engine
used by the tablespace. Currently, the only accepted values for
engine_name are NDB and NDBCLUSTER.

WAIT is parsed but otherwise ignored, and so has no effect in MySQL
5.5. It is intended for future expansion.

When ALTER TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE is used with ENGINE = NDB, a
data file is created on each Cluster data node. You can verify that the
data files were created and obtain information about them by querying
the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table. For example, the following query
shows all data files belonging to the tablespace named newts:

mysql> SELECT LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME, FILE_NAME, EXTRA
    -> FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES

499 ENUM 23 ENUM('value1','value2',...) [CHARACTER SET charset_name] [COLLATE
collation_name]

An enumeration. A string object that can have only one value, chosen
from the list of values 'value1', 'value2', ..., NULL or the special ''
error value. ENUM values are represented internally as integers.

An ENUM column can have a maximum of 65,535 distinct elements. (The
practical limit is less than 3000.) A table can have no more than 255
unique element list definitions among its ENUM and SET columns
considered as a group. For more information on these limits, see
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/limits-frm-file.html.

1 [b]The Nitrogen Cycle and New Tank Syndrome[/b]

The nitrogen cycle as it pertains to the home aquarium is the process of establishing beneficial bacteria in order to break down nitrogenous waste compounds into less harmful nitrates that can be removed from the aquarium via plants or water changes.

[b]Food in equals waste out[/b]

Like all living creatures, fish give off waste products, these nitrogenous waste products break down into ammonia (NH3), which is highly toxic to both fish &amp; Invertebrates. In nature, the volume of water per fish is extremely high and waste products become diluted to low concentrations and are ultimately purified by the mass amounts of nitrofying bacteria that exist. In aquariums, however, it can take as little as a few hours for ammonia concentrations to reach toxic levels. How much ammonia is too much? The quick answer is: if a test kit is able to measure it, you&#039;ve got too much, it&#039;s in a high enough concentrations to stress fish and cause irritation. Consider emergency action such as water changes using Reverse Osmosed water or ammonia locking products, if your ammonia levels are .25ppm or higher.

[b]What Is the Nitrogen Cycle?[/b]

The Nitrogen Cycle is the biological process that converts ammonia into other, relatively harmless nitrogen compounds. Fortunately, several species of bacteria do this conversion for us. Some species convert ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (N02-), while others convert nitrite to nitrate (NO3-). Thus, cycling the tank refers to the process of establishing bacterial colonies in the filter bed that convert ammonia -&gt; nitrite -&gt; nitrate. Nitrate is only toxic at high levels that take time to accumulate and can be removed through partial water changes or aquatic plant life.

The desired species of nitrifying bacteria are present everywhere (e.g., in the air), therefore, once you have an ammonia source in your tank, its only a matter of time before the desired bacteria establish a colony in your filter bed. The most common way to do this is to seed your new aquarium using water or substrate from and existing aquarium, live rock or to place one or two (emphasis on one or two) hardy and inexpensive fish in your aquarium (damselfish and chromis are good for this purpose). The fish waste contains the ammonia on which the bacteria will live and grow, be careful not to overfeed them, causing more ammonia than can be handled by the growing bacteria bed.

[code]

[/code]
[b]New Tank Syndrome[/b]

During the cycling process, ammonia levels will vary wildly as the nitrite-forming bacteria take hold. Because nitrate-forming bacteria don&#039;t even begin to appear until nitrite is present in significant quantities, nitrite levels skyrocket (as the built-up ammonia is converted), continuing to rise as the continually-produced ammonia is converted to nitrite. Once the nitrate-forming bacteria take hold, nitrite levels fall, nitrate levels rise, and the tank is fully cycled.

[b]When is a new tank ready for fish?[/b]

Your tank is fully cycled once nitrates are being produced (and ammonia and nitrite levels are zero). To determine when the cycle has completed, you will need to have a marine water test kit, and measure the levels weekly at first and then monthly. Another possibility is to bring water samples to your local fish store and let them perform the test for you. The cycling process normally takes anywhere from 2-6 weeks, at temperatures below 70F it takes even longer to cycle a tank. In comparison to other types of bacteria, nitrifying bacteria grow slowly. Under optimal conditions; however, it can take only 15 hours for a colony to double in size! It is possible to speed up the cycling process by using bacteria based products available that will speed the process of building the nitrifying bacteria beds. The use of these products along with proper temperature, water flow and lighting can shorten the cycling process to 1-3 weeks. Reverse Osmose water should be used to limit the amount of ammonia, nitrite and silicates that are present in the water.

[b]Don&#039;t Rush It![/b]

Warning: AVOID THE TEMPTATION TO GET MORE FISH UNTIL AFTER YOUR TANK HAS FULLY CYCLED! More fish means more ammonia production, increasing the stress on all fish and the likelihood of fish deaths. Once ammonia levels reach highly stressful or toxic levels, your tank has succumbed to New Tank Syndrome; the tank has not yet fully cycled, and the accumulating ammonia has concentrations lethal to your fish. Each time you add a couple of fish you will need to allow a couple of weeks for the bacteria in your aquarium filter bed to grow in number to handle the increased amount of ammonia and filtering loads. Keep in mind that not only are you adding more fish, but you are also increasing the amount of food fed, consumed and the amount of uneated food, all of which creates higher ammonia levels.

[b]How Much Ammonia Is Too Much?[/b]

In an established tank ammonia levels should always be 0 ppm, which is undetectable using standard test kits available at stores. The presence of detectable levels indicates that your bio filter is not working adequately, either because your tank has not yet been completely cycled, or the filter is not functioning adequately (e.g. too small for fish load, clogged, etc.) It is imperative that you address the cause of the problem (filter) in addition to the symptoms (high ammonia levels).

The exact concentration at which ammonia becomes toxic to fish varies among species; some are more tolerant than others. In addition, other factors like water temperature and chemistry play a significant role. For example, ammonia (NH3) continually changes to ammonium (NH4+) and vice versa, with the relative concentrations of each depending on the water&#039;s temperature and pH. Ammonia is extremely toxic; ammonium is relatively harmless. At higher temperatures and pH, more of the nitrogen is in the toxic ammonia form than at lower pH.

[b]Speeding Up Cycling Time[/b]

The nitrogen cycle can be sped up or jump started in a number of ways. Unfortunately, they require access to an established tank, which a beginning aquarist may not have available. The basic idea is to find an established tank, take some of the bacteria out of it and place them in the new tank. Most filters have some sort of foam block or floss insert on which nitrifying bacteria attach. Borrowing all or part of such an insert and placing it in the new tanks filter gets things going more quickly. If the established tank uses an undergravel filter, nitrifying bacteria will be attached to the gravel. Take some of the gravel (a cup or more) and hang it in a mesh bag in your filter (if you can), or lay it over the top of the gravel in the new tank (if it has an UGF).

[b]In conclusion[/b]

More recently, products containing colonies of nitrifying bacteria have become available at pet shops (e.g. Fritz, Bio-zyme, Cycle). In theory, adding the bacteria jump-starts the colonization process as above. Net experience with such products has been mixed; some folks report success, while others report they don&#039;t work as well as advertised. In principle, such products should work well. However, nitrifying bacteria cannot live indefinitely without oxygen and food. Thus, the effectiveness of a product depends on its freshness and can be adversely effected by poor handling (e.g. overheating). Unfortunately, these products dont come with a freshness date, so there is no way to know how old they are.

Of course, there are many variations on the above that work. However, it is a bit difficult to give an exact recipe that is guaranteed to work. It is advisable to take a conservative approach and not add fish too quickly. In addition, testing the water to be sure nitrates are being produced eliminates the guesswork of determining when your tank has cycled. Remember that using any method to cycle your tank is going to take some time and that following the advice written here along with some patience and diligent water testing, will in the end result in a well established and enjoyable marine aquarium.

2 [b]LED Aquarium Lighting Systems[/b]

LED Lighting Systems are quickly becoming the preferred choice of aquarium lighting for both freshwater and marine aquarium hobbyists. Long bulb life, low heat output, shimmer effect, sleek designs and overall power savings make LED systems hard to beat.

[b]Aquarium Lighting[/b]

The past few decades have brought about an enormous amount of innovation in aquarium lighting systems for the home aquarium hobbyist. It was not that long ago when many hobbyists used &quot;shop light&quot; fixtures with basic 40 watt per tube fluorescent bulbs for their aquarium lighting. Advanced hobbyists would employ expensive metal halide solutions that required both a large up front cost and expensive on-going bulb replacement ever 9 to 12 months. Over time fluorescent aquarium fixtures based on power compact or t5 bulbs became the norm for the average hobbyist, with metal halides dominating the marine reef and other high-end aquarium setups. However, the entire aquarium lighting landscape is rapidly changing with the introduction of LED based lighting systems that combine brilliant lighting options with affordability and efficiency.

[b]LED (Light-emitting diode)[/b]

A LED or light-emitting diode is a solid state semiconductor lighting source. LEDs produce light through the use of a light-emitting diode that when switched on allows electrons to recombine with electron holes within the device, which release energy in the form of photons. Basically, LEDs are just tiny light bulbs that fit easily into an electrical circuit. However, unlike ordinary incandescent or fluorescent bulbs, they don&#039;t have a filament or gas that will burn out, and they don&#039;t get especially hot. They are illuminated solely by the movement of electrons in a semiconductor material, and they last just as long as a standard transistor. The lifespan of an LED surpasses the short life of an incandescent or fluorescent bulbs by thousands of hours. LEDs have many advantages over incandescent lighting, fluorescent lighting and even metal halide lighting sources including lower energy consumption, longer bulb lifetime, improved robustness and resistance to shock, smaller size, faster switching, and greater durability and reliability. LEDs powerful enough for aquarium lighting are relatively new to the hobby; however, new LED lighting systems are quickly becoming available to the mainstream aquarium hobbyist.

[b]Overview of LED Lighting Systems[/b]

LED Lighting Systems are capable of providing an intense amount of light in any desired kelvin temperature, while using less electricity and producing less heat than either modern fluorescent or metal halide systems. Since LEDs do not produce a lot of heat, they can be cooled through the use of heat sinks instead of bulking and noisy fans. This allows LED Lighting Systems to be exceptionally small and quiet, which means LED enclosures are often extremely thin and light. As LEDs are very small and light, they can be configured into a large variety of fixture configurations including; leg mounted on top of the aquarium, suspended pendant from above, flexible rope enclosures and even sealed underwater fixtures that allow for truly unique lighting placement. LED lights also create the shimmering lighting effect of sunlight dancing underwater as the light passes through the rippling water at the surface of the aquarium, similar to natural sunlight or metal halide lighting.

LED Aquarium Lighting Systems are quickly changing the way aquarium hobbyists illuminate their aquariums and grow plant and coral livestock. LED Aquarium Lighting Systems can be implemented in a wide variety of form factors including: strip, pendant, rope, retro-fit and completely custom configurations. The compact size and limited heat output of these systems allows hobbyists to utilize LED lighting in places and ways that they could never have done with metal halide or fluorescent lighting. LED lighting systems also reduce or eliminate all together the need for expensive equipment like water chillers and moving track systems designed to combat the excessive heat output of Metal Halide Lighting.

There are currently LED Lighting Systems from a variety of major aquarium lighting vendors that cover all aspects of the aquarium hobby from planted freshwater aquariums to coral reefs. Reef aquarium hobbyists now have a true replacement for high wattage (250 to 400 watt) Metal Halide bulbs. 400 watt metal halide lights can now be replaced with 60 watts of LED lighting without any adverse effects on corals or plants. LED Aquarium Lighting eliminates the yearly expense and hassle of replacing expensive bulbs and eliminates fading colors in corals, clams and inverts caused by bulbs that slowly lose their lighting intensity. In addition, hobbyists are able to save a significant amount of money on their electric bill through lower wattage consumption from their lighting system and less usage of cooling devices like chillers, fans and air conditioning.

[b]Aquarium Lighting[/b]

The past few decades have brought about an enormous amount of innovation in aquarium lighting systems for the home aquarium hobbyist. It was not that long ago when many hobbyists used "shop light" fixtures with basic 40 watt per tube fluorescent bulbs for their aquarium lighting. Advanced hobbyists would employ expensive metal halide solutions that required both a large up front cost and expensive on-going bulb replacement ever 9 to 12 months. Over time fluorescent aquarium fixtures based on power compact or t5 bulbs became the norm for the average hobbyist, with metal halides dominating the marine reef and other high-end aquarium setups. However, the entire aquarium lighting landscape is rapidly changing with the introduction of LED based lighting systems that combine brilliant lighting options with affordability and efficiency.

[b]LED (Light-emitting diode)[/b]

A LED or light-emitting diode is a solid state semiconductor lighting source. LEDs produce light through the use of a light-emitting diode that when switched on allows electrons to recombine with electron holes within the device, which release energy in the form of photons. Basically, LEDs are just tiny light bulbs that fit easily into an electrical circuit. However, unlike ordinary incandescent or fluorescent bulbs, they don&#039;t have a filament or gas that will burn out, and they don&#039;t get especially hot. They are illuminated solely by the movement of electrons in a semiconductor material, and they last just as long as a standard transistor. The lifespan of an LED surpasses the short life of an incandescent or fluorescent bulbs by thousands of hours. LEDs have many advantages over incandescent lighting, fluorescent lighting and even metal halide lighting sources including lower energy consumption, longer bulb lifetime, improved robustness and resistance to shock, smaller size, faster switching, and greater durability and reliability. LEDs powerful enough for aquarium lighting are relatively new to the hobby; however, new LED lighting systems are quickly becoming available to the mainstream aquarium hobbyist.

[b]Overview of LED Lighting Systems[/b]

LED Lighting Systems are capable of providing an intense amount of light in any desired kelvin temperature, while using less electricity and producing less heat than either modern fluorescent or metal halide systems. Since LEDs do not produce a lot of heat, they can be cooled through the use of heat sinks instead of bulking and noisy fans. This allows LED Lighting Systems to be exceptionally small and quiet, which means LED enclosures are often extremely thin and light. As LEDs are very small and light, they can be configured into a large variety of fixture configurations including; leg mounted on top of the aquarium, suspended pendant from above, flexible rope enclosures and even sealed underwater fixtures that allow for truly unique lighting placement. LED lights also create the shimmering lighting effect of sunlight dancing underwater as the light passes through the rippling water at the surface of the aquarium, similar to natural sunlight or metal halide lighting.

LED Aquarium Lighting Systems are quickly changing the way aquarium hobbyists illuminate their aquariums and grow plant and coral livestock. LED Aquarium Lighting Systems can be implemented in a wide variety of form factors including: strip, pendant, rope, retro-fit and completely custom configurations. The compact size and limited heat output of these systems allows hobbyists to utilize LED lighting in places and ways that they could never have done with metal halide or fluorescent lighting. LED lighting systems also reduce or eliminate all together the need for expensive equipment like water chillers and moving track systems designed to combat the excessive heat output of Metal Halide Lighting.

There are currently LED Lighting Systems from a variety of major aquarium lighting vendors that cover all aspects of the aquarium hobby from planted freshwater aquariums to coral reefs. Reef aquarium hobbyists now have a true replacement for high wattage (250 to 400 watt) Metal Halide bulbs. 400 watt metal halide lights can now be replaced with 60 watts of LED lighting without any adverse effects on corals or plants. LED Aquarium Lighting eliminates the yearly expense and hassle of replacing expensive bulbs and eliminates fading colors in corals, clams and inverts caused by bulbs that slowly lose their lighting intensity. In addition, hobbyists are able to save a significant amount of money on their electric bill through lower wattage consumption from their lighting system and less usage of cooling devices like chillers, fans and air conditioning.

3 [b]Aquarium Lighting Intensity and Quality in the Home Aquarium[/b]

[b]Overview[/b]

Aquarium lighting does far more than just illuminate the aquarium itself, proper aquarium lighting can greatly enhance the appearance of fish, plants, corals and invertebrates along with providing vital health benefits to all types of aquarium life forms. Thus, there are many important factors to consider when selecting the correct lighting system for your aquarium. When choosing the correct aquarium lighting system for a particular aquarium setup, the hobbyist needs to their best to replicate the natural lighting conditions that their aquarium inhabitants would experience in nature. Fortunately with the recent advancements in aquarium lighting systems, this has become much easier to do due to the introduction of complex lighting systems that simulate all types of natural lighting environments even night time lighting as well. In order to put together the best lighting for a particular aquariums needs, it is important to know the factors that go into deciding on which lighting system to choose.

The main factors involved in choosing the correct aquarium lighting system are the lighting spectral qualities and lighting intensity. There are many factors the affect the lighting quality and intensity of a lighting system, thus the following factors: water depth, water clarity, water movement and lighting intensity should be taken into consideration before making a lighting system decision. Understanding the natural conditions of your aquarium inhabitants and their lighting needs along with understanding your home aquarium environment are critical to implementing the best lighting solution for your aquariums needs.

[b]Lighting Spectral Qualities[/b]

Lighting Spectrum is something most aquarium hobbyists have heard about in connection with aquarium lighting, but probably do not have a full understanding about exactly what it is and what it means for their aquarium inhabitants. Sunlight is a combination of many types of light blended together, with the red, yellow and green areas of the spectrum being the ones most easily visible to the human eye. Ultraviolet, in the blue end of the spectrum, is invisible but its effect can be felt very easily as it is this end of the spectrum that causes the warm sun sensation you feel on your skin from the sun and causes sunburn when overexposure occurs. You can usually feel a quick change in temperature of your skin when a cloud passes over, this signals a decrease in the amount of radiation in a given light field. For humans prolonged exposure to this type of light is dangerous to both our skin and eyes; however, in the aquarium environment this UV radiation plays an important role in coral, plant &amp; invertebrate health and photosynthesis.

The spectrum of bulbs for aquariums are expressed as a color temperature given or stated in Kelvin degrees. Sunlight has a color temperature of about 5500K, at 12 noon over a tropical reef while actinic light sources typically have a color temperature of about 7100K. The more blue the light the higher the temperature. Light is electromagnetic energy in the form of waves, with these waves having frequencies. As the temperature of a substance increases, the frequency of the light emitted also increases, thus lower temperatures produce red and yellow light, while higher temperatures produce light ranging from white to the blue colors of the spectrum.

[code]

[code]
[/code]

In nature, as light enters and passes through the first 15 feet of water, the red and orange wavelengths are absorbed by the water, increasing the Kelvin rating of the light, and giving the light a more blue appearance. As the light penetrates to 30 feet, the water absorbs the yellow spectrum, and when the light continues past 50 feet, the water filters the green wavelengths, leaving just the blue and violet wavelengths resulting in the light with the highest Kelvin rating. This is not so noticeable in the home aquarium as we typically do not maintain aquariums with a depth of 15 or more feet!

Poor quality lighting products not intended for the aquarium hobby typically have Kelvin ratings in the 2700k to 4300K range which produces too much red and yellow light. These lighting products are not only undesirable because they do not provide the needed lighting qualities for most aquarium plants and corals, but they also promote undesirable types of nuisance algae. While the quality of aquarium lighting and its affects on aquarium inhabitants is extremely important, so is the look or aesthetics of the aquarium as well. It is important to select bulb types and spectral qualities that satisfy both the needs of your aquariums inhabitants and also provides a pleasing aesthetic for the aquarium hobbyist as well.

[b]Lighting Intensity[/b]

Lighting intensity is measured as Lux at the surface it impacts and as watts when measured at its source. Since light spreads outward and scatters in all directions, the farther we are from the source the less light we see. The intensity of light decreases by the square of the distance that area is from the lighting source. If a fluorescent bulb is moved 2 inches away from the water, it will be 4 times lower in intensity. This is an important fact to remember when placing bulbs that appear at first to have the correct amount of intensity for an aquaria. As you raise them higher above the water, the intensity will drop dramatically and you might not have the correct amount of light reaching your animals.

[code]
[/code]
[img]http://www.aquariumdomain.com/adSocial/PF.Base/file/attachment/2016/07/432a3bfc75e39a9f9a064c7be272326e_view.jpg[/img]
[code]
[/code]

Lighting intensity can be affected by other factors other than distance. Turbidity of the water can significantly reduce the actual amount of light that penetrates the surface and reaches the animals. In tanks where activated carbon is used and is changed regularly light penetration into the aquarium can be maximized. Cleaning or removing glass or acrylic lenses from the light hood will also help. The intensity of light above the surface of a reef can be as high as 130,000 lux. The actual amount of intensity that penetrates the surface of the water can be about 70,000, with maybe only 15,000 lux actually reaching the 10-15 meter mark. The water surface also reflects some of the light back, reducing the amount that penetrates the water and reaches the corals.

Light intensity at the source is measured in watts. The higher the watts, the more intense the light, and the more energy required to produce the light. A 100-watt bulb, for example, will give off more light than a 40-watt bulb, and will cost more to use. A watt is actually related to a lux in that one lux is equal to 1.46 milliwatts (0.00146 watts) of energy of one specific frequency (555 nm) hitting a surface area of one square meter. However, since bulbs used in aquarium lighting systems emit light of many frequencies (not just 555nm), no exact formula can be used when determining the number of lux produced by a bulb of a specific wattage.

[code]

[code]
[/code]

It is also very important to note that some types of aquarium light bulbs (metal halide, fluorescent, etc.) begin losing intensity long before they stop emitting light. The general rule of thumb is to replace these type of aquarium bulbs every 8 to 12 months with some reef aquarium lighting needing replacement every 6 months. These times will vary based on bulb type and lighting requirements for a particular aquarium, so one should consult the documentation for the bulb type being used.

In nature most corals and marine invertebrates live in conditions that are lit mostly by blue light waves, thus they have adapted to this and will require bulbs that produce these blue wavelengths in the aquarium environment as well. While corals and marine invertebrates thrive under blue light, most hobbyists find aquariums illuminated with blue light only to be unattractive. This aesthetic dilemma can be solved by combining an actinic light with a white light, such as a 50/50 bulb half blue/white or a light combination in which the white lights give light in the range of 8000 to 12000 K. This lighting combination gives corals and invertebrates the spectrum necessary for growth, in addition to the spectrum necessary for accurate color rendering within the aquarium.

[code]
[/code]

Lastly, it is important to consider initial and ongoing operating costs, lighting intensity and spectrum and the heat produced by the lighting system when choosing a lighting system for your marine reef aquarium. Lighting systems for reef aquariums, such as metal halide and hi-output fluorescent systems, tend to be rather expensive due to their high initial cost, high levels of required energy, and characteristically frequent bulb changes.

Lighting systems designed for reef aquariums produce two types of intense heat, which must be addressed prior to installation. The first type of heat - from the actual bulbs - surrounds the bulbs and should be removed with cooling fans. The second type of heat - radiant heat produced by the lighting system - is unavoidably absorbed by the aquarium water and should be controlled with a water chiller (be sure to budget for a water chiller in your installation plans). Fortunately a large number of LED aquarium lighting systems for both freshwater and marine environments are becoming widely available and at a variety of cost points. These newer LED lighting systems require much less energy, produce less heat, long bulb life and produce full spectrum quality light even towards the end of the bulbs life span.

[b]In conclusion[/b]

When choosing lighting for your aquarium, keep your aquarium inhabitants natural lighting conditions foremost in your mind, while still budgeting for the initial cost of the lighting system and for replacement bulbs. Other factors such as heat produced from the lighting system, physical size and dimensions of the system and airflow should also be considered before purchasing a lighting system. Having the correct wattage, Kelvin rating and lighting intensity can mean the difference between an aquarium with beautifully colored fish, thriving plants and corals and a tank overgrown with nuisance algae.

4 [b]Wet/Dry Filtration Systems[/b]

[b]Overview[/b]

Wet/Dry filtration has become one of the corner stones of a well designed aquarium filtration system. Along with the general aspects of Wet/Dry filtration, this guide covers all of the benefits of this type of system including biological filtration, mechanical filtration, water oxygenation, chemical filtration and sump configurations. From the basic Wet/Dry filter to the more recent advancements in these filter systems, this guide bring the aquarium hobbyist up-to-speed on this very desirable aquarium filtration system.

Wet/Dry filtration is a method of filtration that focuses on providing biological, mechanical and chemical filtration for both marine and freshwater aquariums. Wet/Dry filters get their name because they take water from the aquarium via an overflow system and pass the water through the air over a series of porous bio-material which is usually in the form of plastic bio-balls. While this process gives the filter system its name, the modern Wet/Dry filter system does much more. While the primary task of a Wet/Dry filter is to provide biological filtration, it is also an excellent filter for both mechanical and chemical filtration as well. After siphoning the water from the aquarium via a skimmer or overflow system, the water is passed through one or more chambers containing filter pads or sponges, where mechanical filtration takes place as physical particles are removed from the water stream before they enter the trickle tower portion of the Wet/Dry filter. It is at this point that the water is passed into the trickle tower or bio-chamber where it drops down onto plastic bio-balls that are piled up on top of a plastic grate at the bottom of the chamber. This allows the water to pass through the air as it drips through the bio-ball chamber which creates an ideal environment for beneficial aerobic bacteria to live.

[code]
[/code]

It is these aerobic bacteria living on the bio-balls that perform the biological filtering of the water as they remove waste products from the water and produce oxygen. At this point the water drops down into the main sump area of the Wet/Dry Filter system, where chemical filtration can be added along with other filtration devices such as protein skimmers, activated carbon media and much more. Lastly, the water moves into the final chamber which contains the pump to return the water from the Wet/Dry filter sump back into the aquarium. Since Wet/Dry filters excel at biological filtration, they have become one of the most important ingredients to a successful aquarium filtration system. Biological filtration is the process in which ammonia is converted to the less toxic nitrite, then to the relatively non-toxic nitrate. While nitrate is non-toxic at low levels, it can build up over time and become toxic to most aquarium inhabitants. Nitrate will need to be removed from the aquarium system either through the use of live plants which consume nitrate as food or from water changes where aquarium water is removed and replaced with fresh water that is from a nitrate free source.

[code]
[/code]

[b]Biological[/b]

Wet/Dry systems earned their reputation as excellent biological filters by the method by which they stimulate bacterial growth. A successful bacteria colony requires moisture, heat and oxygen, all of which are effectively cultivated in properly maintained Wet/Dry filter systems. The temperature of your tank will provide the necessary heat for proper growth, and the moisture is taken care of by the water in your tank. The process of how the water is siphoned from the aquarium surface and trickled over the biological surface is how the Wet/Dry does the rest by providing the correct environment and living conditions for billions upon billions of beneficial aerobic bacteria colonies to live and thrive. Each Wet/Dry filter uses its own type and grade of bio material. Most filters use bio-balls, which are spherical plastic balls which are hollow and have a netted structure that provides large amounts of surface area for beneficial bacteria to live. Other Wet/Dry filter designs use a structure called Bio Bale, which looks like plastic hay, which is also very effective at stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria. New versions of bio-material and Wet/Dry configurations are popping up within the hobby as filter manufacturers look to further improve on what is already a very effective design.

[b]Oxygenation[/b]

The initial process of skimming the water from the aquariums surface and returning it via the surface of the water creates excellent water agitation which saturates the water with large amounts of dissolved oxygen. On top of this process, when the water enters the Wet/Dry filter from your tank, it is poured over the biomaterial at a high velocity, as the water flows over the material it mixes with the surrounding air, supersaturating the water with oxygen. It is this mixing affect that contributes to the name Wet/Dry filtration. There are even opportunities within the sump portion of the Wet/Dry filter itself for oxygen to be introduced into the water via the return from a device such as a protein skimmer or by passing over additional filter media or substrates where more beneficial bacteria may be present.

While all models of Wet/Dry filters have mechanical filtration via pre-filters in the skimmer box to filtration trays located above the bio material, newer model Wet/Dry filters are constantly improving on this by providing more physical filtration in the form of micro mesh bags, sponge filters and media pads located in various locations throughout the filter system. Any of the Wet/Dry filter systems commonly available within the aquarium hobby provide not only excellent biological filtration, but top notch mechanical filtration as well. Additional mechanical filtration would only be necessary in the most extreme of cases where the aquarium inhabitants produce large amounts of physical waste.

[b]The Sump[/b]

The sump area of the Wet/Dry filter system allows the hobbyist a convenient location to locate chemical filtration, protein skimmers, live rock (saltwater setup), plants, macro algae and much more. It is now quite common for Wet/Dry filter systems to come with expanded sump sections to allow hobbyists to keep a variety of additional filters and even create refugiums and plant based vegetable filters. All of these additional forms of filtration make the Wet/Dry filter a complete all-in-one filtration system that is capable of handling all types of marine or freshwater aquarium setups.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

Wet/Dry filtratioin systems are not simply a good option to consider, it has become the ideal starting point for a high quality filtration system that excels in both freshwater and saltwater aquarium installations. Due to their popularity, they have expanded with many different variations of the standard Wet/Dry system with expanded sumps, refugiums, Berlin style setups and many more. Be sure to carefully investigate your options when setting up your next aquarium and find the right Wet/Dry system to fit your aquarium goals. [b]Wet/Dry Filtration Systems[/b]

[b]Overview[/b]

Wet/Dry filtration has become one of the corner stones of a well designed aquarium filtration system. Along with the general aspects of Wet/Dry filtration, this guide covers all of the benefits of this type of system including biological filtration, mechanical filtration, water oxygenation, chemical filtration and sump configurations. From the basic Wet/Dry filter to the more recent advancements in these filter systems, this guide bring the aquarium hobbyist up-to-speed on this very desirable aquarium filtration system.

Wet/Dry filtration is a method of filtration that focuses on providing biological, mechanical and chemical filtration for both marine and freshwater aquariums. Wet/Dry filters get their name because they take water from the aquarium via an overflow system and pass the water through the air over a series of porous bio-material which is usually in the form of plastic bio-balls. While this process gives the filter system its name, the modern Wet/Dry filter system does much more. While the primary task of a Wet/Dry filter is to provide biological filtration, it is also an excellent filter for both mechanical and chemical filtration as well. After siphoning the water from the aquarium via a skimmer or overflow system, the water is passed through one or more chambers containing filter pads or sponges, where mechanical filtration takes place as physical particles are removed from the water stream before they enter the trickle tower portion of the Wet/Dry filter. It is at this point that the water is passed into the trickle tower or bio-chamber where it drops down onto plastic bio-balls that are piled up on top of a plastic grate at the bottom of the chamber. This allows the water to pass through the air as it drips through the bio-ball chamber which creates an ideal environment for beneficial aerobic bacteria to live.

[code]
[/code]

It is these aerobic bacteria living on the bio-balls that perform the biological filtering of the water as they remove waste products from the water and produce oxygen. At this point the water drops down into the main sump area of the Wet/Dry Filter system, where chemical filtration can be added along with other filtration devices such as protein skimmers, activated carbon media and much more. Lastly, the water moves into the final chamber which contains the pump to return the water from the Wet/Dry filter sump back into the aquarium. Since Wet/Dry filters excel at biological filtration, they have become one of the most important ingredients to a successful aquarium filtration system. Biological filtration is the process in which ammonia is converted to the less toxic nitrite, then to the relatively non-toxic nitrate. While nitrate is non-toxic at low levels, it can build up over time and become toxic to most aquarium inhabitants. Nitrate will need to be removed from the aquarium system either through the use of live plants which consume nitrate as food or from water changes where aquarium water is removed and replaced with fresh water that is from a nitrate free source.

[b]Biological[/b]

Wet/Dry systems earned their reputation as excellent biological filters by the method by which they stimulate bacterial growth. A successful bacteria colony requires moisture, heat and oxygen, all of which are effectively cultivated in properly maintained Wet/Dry filter systems.

5 [b]Introduction to Acropora Corals for the Beginner Reef Aquarium Hobbyist[/b]


[b]Introduction[/b]

Acropora corals are highly adaptive, opportunistic and fast growing, which has made them a very popular species in reef aquarium hobby. Acropora can be found in a variety of grow forms ranging from plates to staghorns and a variety of colors. With the popularity and variety of this coral an entire website could be dedicated to their selection and husbandry. However, this guide will introduce the various varieties of Acropora and will cover their scientific background and information related to Acropora within the context of the reef aquarium hobby environment.

[/code]

[b]Scientific Information[/b]

Genus Acropora (ak-roh-pohr-ah) is part of the largest family and most important contributor to coral reef formations in the world. The two primary genera Acropora and Montipora together account for almost one-third of all hermatypic or reef-building coral species. While found in both the pacific and atlantic oceans, Acropora is far more dominantly found in the Pacific ocean as there are only 3 known species of Acropora in the Atlantic. Acropora contain specialized axial corallite, which do not contain zooxanthellae, but allow for a very rapid growth rate, as they are fed by other areas of the colony. This allows for the genus to have a advantage over other corals in that they can outgrow them and rapidly colonize the reef. These fast growing Acropora branches can be identified by their light-colored tips, which are almost white or brightly hued.

[/code]

[b]About Acropora Corals[/b]

There are 13 to 15 basic growth forms of Acropora that vary according to size and shape of the branches, the position of the brances, the number of corallite septa and the nature of the coenosteum. The most commonly available aquarium species tend to fall into the following growth forms: branching, bushy, cluster, finger, bottlebrush and tabular. In the aquarium hobby , species are generally sold by form and color as oppossed to the species i.e. purple staghorn or pink bottlebrush. This is understandable, but can make it difficult in providing a species designation, which is then left upto the aquarist.

Acropora are highly diverse and adaptable, which makes figuring out the best aquarium conditions difficult. Specimens have been collected in a multitude of areas including areas of strong water current and intense lighting to deep water areas and calm lagoons. Pretty much anywhere coral reefs can be found, Acropora can also be found there thriving. Discussed in the next section, growth forms and not species are probably the better indicator of the natural location of the coral. Coloration of Acropora is even more diverse than the growth forms, with almost every hue of the rainbow possible.

[b]Acropora Corals in the Home Reef Aquarium[/b]

Acropora in the wild are highly adaptable and can exist in a variety of locations including: calm lagoons, pounding reef crests and even reef flats where they can be out of water for periods of time. They tolerate huge differences in light intensity, water movement and even salinity, thus one would think that they would extremely easy to keep in the reef aquarium, but nothing could be further from the truth. In fact they are very demanding of their conditions when housed in captivity. However, once they are acclimated to aquarium life, and if kept with stable water conditions, they will also thrive in the reef aquarium.

Generally speaking, Acropora species with thick branches are normally more difficult to keep than those with thin branches. This is most likely because of the inability of reef aquarists to provide enough water flow that the thick branched species need to thrive, thus making these species more prone initially to problems. Brown specimens, bottlebrush and thin branched species tend to be more tolerant of the lower water flow and light level conditions. Tabletop species are among the most difficult Acropora species to keep in the home reef aquarium, with staghorn specimens being somewhere in the middle.

[/code]

Captive-bred or frag specimens seem to be generally healthier and easier to care for than wild specimens. Nonetheless, all Acropora specimens seem to prefer strong, random or mixing type water current with intense lighting and high levels of calcium and strontium to promote maximum growth and health. Water quality should also be excellent and very stable, thus Acropora do much better in established reef aquariums where water parameters are generally more stable.

[/code]

[b]In conclusion[/b]

Acropora need to be acclimated carefully to their new surroundings so that they are not shocked by light, water parameter changes or other stresses. They should also be located in their final position as quickly as possibly to avoid stress or unfulfilled metabolic needs. Typical stressors include: low light, low water current and frequent movement from different positions in the aquarium. They do not tolerate sudden changes in aquarium conditions, especially water temperature and will fade in color, recede in growth or even die if proper water conditions are not maintained. While frag or captive-bred species do best, they often require about 6 months to regain full normal growth rates. Acropora are also susceptible to most known coral diseases including: white-band disease, black-band disease, recession, etc. While Acropora are a demanding species to keep in captivity, it is possible to keep them successfully and can be an extremely rewarding coral to keep and raise. Hopefully the information in this article along with the experience obtained from keeping corals in the reef aquarium will help increase the likelyhood that these corals can not only be kept successfully in the reef aquarium, but also thrive as well.

6 [b]Acclimating Corals to the marine reef aquarium[/b]

After selecting the perfect new Coral colony for their aquarium, the marine reef hobbyist should take the necessary steps to safely add their new marine coral to its new aquatic home. The recommended steps are clearly laid out, so that a hobbyist of any level will benefit from this blog. Notes and warnings are included for areas that require special attention or are common areas where new hobbyists typically make mistakes.

[b]Why we need to Acclimate Corals[/b]

The vast majority of aquarium hobbyists strive to provide the best possible environment and care for all of their aquariums inhabitants. It is because of this attention to excellent husbandry, that collectively as a hobby, reef aquarists have learned the best methods in which to introduce and maintain corals within the aquarium environment. There is probably no more critical time for a coral than during the process of being transported home and introduced into the hobbyists reef aquarium. During this period of time the coral will be subjected to many stresses, that while inevitable, can be greatly reduced through the care and technique that the marine aquarium hobbyist uses to introduce the new coral into its new home. In order to safely acclimate Corals into an already established aquarium it is important to closely follow this proven set of procedures designed to limit any stress on the new specimen and get it acclimated as quickly as possible.
[code]

[code]

[/code]
It is highly recommended to look over all the steps ahead of time and be sure to have all the necesarry items handy and ready to go prior to the arrival of the new coral specimen. This acclimation procedure is a safe and easy way to introduce Corals from the relatively stressful water chemistry of its shipping bag to the healthy and safe conditions of its new home. Though it may seem like the best course of action is to get your new specimen into your clean aquarium as soon as possible, it is extremely important to note that rapid changes in water conditions or chemistry can be more dangerous to an aquatic animal than being kept longer in an unhealthy environment. It is this slow transition from shipping container to established tank that is the focus of this acclimation procedure.

Note: It is generally recommended that all newly purchased specimens be quarantined in a separate tank before introduction to the population of your established aquarium; however, the acclimation process is the same either way (assuming the quarantine tank has the same water chemistry as the main aquarium).

[code]

[/code]
[b]Acclimating corals into an established reef aquarium[/b]

Note: This procedure should not take any more than 1 hour to complete.

Important Note: Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium.

Before you start, you will need the following:

[ul]
[li]Non-abrasive net
[li]Plastic or glass cup
[li]Clean plastic or glass container to keep the specimen during the acclimation process
[li]A means to access water from your aquarium
[li]Aquarium Thermometer
[/ul]

Steps to take to properly acclimate a new Coral specimen

[ul]
[li]Open the bag or shipping container and carefully place coral with the water from the bag into the empty bucket or container.[/li]
[li]Add 1 cup of your aquarium water to the bucket slowly.[/li]
[li]Repeat this process adding 1 cup of aquarium water every 5 minutes for 30 minutes.[/li]
[li]Dim or turn off the aquarium lights to help minimize stress on the new coral.[/li]
[li]Carefully remove the coral or clam from the bucket. Be extremely careful when handling live corals not to touch the delicate flesh of the animals. Try to handle the corals only by their hard skeletons or the plug or coral rubble that they are attached to whenever possible.[/li]
[li]Place your new coral in a location within your reef community that will not place the newly introduced specimens too close to other well established or aggressive species, as they will sting their new competitors. Check on compatibility issues to see where your new coral should be placed in its new home. Remember that many aggressive coral species extend their sweeper tentacles mainly at night, so what may seem to be a peaceful environment during daylight hours may not be once the lights go out.[/li]
[li]Discard the water left in the bucket. EXCEPTION: Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium.[/li]
[li]Keep the aquarium lights off or at a low level and gradually work up to a higher level, allowing the coral(s) time to adjust before returning lighting to full operating levels. This process should ideally occur over a 2 to 3 hour period.[/li]
[li]At this time your coral species will be ready to coexist with its fellow tank mates.[/li]
[/ul]
[code]

[code]

[/code]
[b]Conclusion[/b]

By following these steps a reef aquarium hobbyist of any level should be able to properly acclimate a new coral specimen to their established reef aquarium. It is also recommended that the aquarium hobbyist pay close attention to their new coral specimen(s) during acclimation and in the short term afterwords to verify that the coral is doing well and taking to its new environment.

Helpful Hints:

[ul]
[li]When Acclimating corals, begin with a low level of lighting and gradually work up to a higher level, allowing the coral(s) time to adjust before lighting increases.[/li]
[li]Never introduce an airstone or any other form of aeration into the shipping bag. Aerating the water inside the shipping bag will only convert non-toxic ammonia to a toxic form that will be extremely harmful to the animal.[/li]
[li]Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium. THESE SPECIES MUST BE KEPT UNDER WATER AT ALL TIMES.[/li]
[li]Do not be too anxious to admire your new specimen. Allow them to adjust to their new home before you expose them to bright lights and attention.[/li]

It is highly recommended to look over all the steps ahead of time and be sure to have all the necesarry items handy and ready to go prior to the arrival of the new coral specimen. This acclimation procedure is a safe and easy way to introduce Corals from the relatively stressful water chemistry of its shipping bag to the healthy and safe conditions of its new home. Though it may seem like the best course of action is to get your new specimen into your clean aquarium as soon as possible, it is extremely important to note that rapid changes in water conditions or chemistry can be more dangerous to an aquatic animal than being kept longer in an unhealthy environment. It is this slow transition from shipping container to established tank that is the focus of this acclimation procedure.

Note: It is generally recommended that all newly purchased specimens be quarantined in a separate tank before introduction to the population of your established aquarium; however, the acclimation process is the same either way (assuming the quarantine tank has the same water chemistry as the main aquarium).

[b]Acclimating corals into an established reef aquarium[/b]

Note: This procedure should not take any more than 1 hour to complete.

Important Note: Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium.

Before you start, you will need the following:

[ul]
[li]Non-abrasive net
[li]Plastic or glass cup
[li]Clean plastic or glass container to keep the specimen during the acclimation process
[li]A means to access water from your aquarium
[li]Aquarium Thermometer
[/ul]

Steps to take to properly acclimate a new Coral specimen

[ul]
[li]Open the bag or shipping container and carefully place coral with the water from the bag into the empty bucket or container.[/li]
[li]Add 1 cup of your aquarium water to the bucket slowly.[/li]
[li]Repeat this process adding 1 cup of aquarium water every 5 minutes for 30 minutes.[/li]
[li]Dim or turn off the aquarium lights to help minimize stress on the new coral.[/li]
[li]Carefully remove the coral or clam from the bucket. Be extremely careful when handling live corals not to touch the delicate flesh of the animals. Try to handle the corals only by their hard skeletons or the plug or coral rubble that they are attached to whenever possible.[/li]
[li]Place your new coral in a location within your reef community that will not place the newly introduced specimens too close to other well established or aggressive species, as they will sting their new competitors. Check on compatibility issues to see where your new coral should be placed in its new home. Remember that many aggressive coral species extend their sweeper tentacles mainly at night, so what may seem to be a peaceful environment during daylight hours may not be once the lights go out.[/li]
[li]Discard the water left in the bucket. EXCEPTION: Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium.[/li]
[li]Keep the aquarium lights off or at a low level and gradually work up to a higher level, allowing the coral(s) time to adjust before returning lighting to full operating levels. This process should ideally occur over a 2 to 3 hour period.[/li]
[li]At this time your coral species will be ready to coexist with its fellow tank mates.[/li]
[/ul]

[/code]
[b]Conclusion[/b]

By following these steps a reef aquarium hobbyist of any level should be able to properly acclimate a new coral specimen to their established reef aquarium. It is also recommended that the aquarium hobbyist pay close attention to their new coral specimen(s) during acclimation and in the short term afterwords to verify that the coral is doing well and taking to its new environment.

Helpful Hints:

[ul]
[li]When Acclimating corals, begin with a low level of lighting and gradually work up to a higher level, allowing the coral(s) time to adjust before lighting increases.[/li]
[li]Never introduce an airstone or any other form of aeration into the shipping bag. Aerating the water inside the shipping bag will only convert non-toxic ammonia to a toxic form that will be extremely harmful to the animal.[/li]
[li]Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium. THESE SPECIES MUST BE KEPT UNDER WATER AT ALL TIMES.[/li]
[li]Do not be too anxious to admire your new specimen. Allow them to adjust to their new home before you expose them to bright lights and attention.[/li]

7 [b]Stocking a Marine Fish-Only / FOWLR Aquarium[/b]

This guide is intended to help out hobbyists who are new to keeping saltwater fish or new to the aquarium hobby in general and would like to start off with a saltwater aquarium. The livestock stocking advice given is intended to be somewhat generic in nature in that it is based on basic filtration, water flow and beginning marine aquarium experience. While advanced filtration, protein skimming, live rock, water changes, sumps with live plants or algae scrubbers will greatly enhance the number of fish on can keep and the speed at which they are added to the aquarium, this guide assumes basic filtration in the form of a simple wet/dry filter or canister filter. We will touch on all the major factors that are involved with properly stocking a saltwater fish-only or FOWLR aquarium and all recommendations will error on the side of caution. The goal of this beginners guide is to give the beginning marine aquarium hobbyist a solid footing with which to make good decisions on how many and which fish they should keep in their new marine aquarium.

When stocking a saltwater fish-only aquarium, there are four main areas to consider before you invest in your first fish. These four very important aspects of stocking a marine aquarium are dissolved water chemistry, filtration system capabilities, fish compatibility and fish size &amp; swimming habits, all of which are factors in selecting fish livestock. The following discussion breaks down each of these areas to provide the beginning marine aquarium hobbyist with the basic information they will need to quickly be on your way to successfully stocking your marine fish aquarium.

[b]Water Chemistry[/b]

Water chemistry is a good place to start when deciding which type of live stock to keep within a marine fish-only tank. While many fish sold within the marine aquarium hobby are tropical reef fish who require warm water 78 Â° to 82 Â° with a lot of water movement and high levels of dissolved oxygen, others require colder water temperatures and only moderate water flow. Different fish also have widely different tolerances for dissolved nutrients in the water like nitrate, while Clownfish, Damselfish and other can tolerate higher nitrate levels, other fish like Butterflyfish and Anthias are much more sensitive to higher nitrate levels. Ultimately, the hobbyist will need to choose between a warmer tropical water aquarium or a cold water aquarium.

After deciding on water temperature, comes decisions on how much internal water flow the aquarium will have and how much of the filtration will be dedicated to nutrient export. Hardy fish species can be kept in aquariums with moderate water flow from the filtration return pump and a basic powerhead, while most reef fish or fish considered moderate in difficulty to keep will require strong waterflow that only multiple powerheads will be able to provide. Always provide water flow that is laminar or varied, either through the use of a controller or through strategic placement of powerheads. In larger aquariums powerheads can be placed near the surface and directed to push water towards each other, which will ultimately produce laminar or varied water flow; however, most hobbyists will want use a powerhead with a controller so that water flow can controlled in order to provide bursts of current. Constant, strong water flow is not desirable for fish, substrate or plants or corals.

[code]

[/code]

The last aspect of water chemistry to consider before selecting fish livestock is the level of nutrient export capabilities of the filtration system. Modern wet/dry filters, canisters and even bio-wheel power filters are cable of breaking down toxic compounds like ammonia and nitrite very efficiently. However, what is left over is nitrate, which over time can build up to high levels. High levels of nitrate will cause stress and reduced overall health to many fish species; as well as, promote nuisance algae growth and overall poor water conditions. While water changes using clean RO/DI based saltwater can reduce nitrate levels, hobbyists will ultimately need to employ filtration methods specifically designed to export or reduce the nitrate levels in the aquarium. In order to keep fish that are considered moderate to difficult to keep, hobbyists will need to employ one or more of the following nutrient export filtration techniques: protein skimming, frequent water changes using RO/DI water and a quality salt mix, large quantity of live rock, sump with fast growing live plants or an algae scrubber solution. Any of these nutrient export solutions can be effective at keeping water quality high and dissolved nitrates low; however, the use of more than one of these techniques at the same time is recommended as they are much more effective when used together.

[b]Filtration System[/b]

As you can probably guess from the water chemistry section, filtration systems have a huge impact on keeping quality water and determining the overall fish load an aquarium can support. Since this guide is specific to fish stocking in a marine aquarium, we will only discuss filtration as it pertains to fish stocking levels. All saltwater fish aquariums will require mechanical filtration, biological filtration and good internal water flow, with water flow affecting both for dissolved oxygen and to assist the mechanical filtration with removing solids. Marine aquariums with light to moderate fish stock levels, which translates to about 1 inch of fish per 5 gallons of water can be successfully maintained by using either a high-end bio-wheel power filter, high-end canister filter or wet/dry filter, combined with powerheads for internal water movement and regular water changes. Adding live rock and a protein skimmer can increase the fish load to 1 inch of fish per 3 gallons and extend the time between water changes. While the further addition of a sump with live plants or an algae scrubber for nutrient export can further increase stocking levels to 1 inch of fish per 2 gallons of water volume. All fish stocking recommendations are based on a tank that is fully cycled and biologically mature. When a tank is first established and the beneficial bacteria are just forming, it is important to move slowly with fish additions and test the water every few days. Weekly water changes and a reduced feeding regimen will also help take the load off of a maturing filtration system. With all new tank setups, fish should be added slowly with one or two fish being added every 2 to 3 weeks, which will allow the filtration system and beneficial bacteria to adjust to the increase in waste products.

[code]

[/code]

After an aquarium is fully mature (approximately 1 year) hobbyists can utilize combinations of filtration techniques and water changes to increase fish loads above what is recommended here. Many factors come into play when giving advice on the fish load an established aquarium can support; however, always remember to work with nature and provide the proper environment to support the nitrogen cycle and move slow to allow beneficial bacteria to do their work. Hobbyists who maintain high levels of dissolved oxygen through laminar water flow, use live rock and live sand, utilize protein skimmers, use sumps for plant or algae nutrient export and last but not least use a RO/DI unit to provide quality water for top off and water changes, will find that keeping a marine aquarium does not have to be difficult and is very enjoyable.

[b]Fish Compatibility[/b]

Fish Compatibility as it pertains to stocking levels in an aquarium is more than just fish fighting with one another. Of course if incompatible fish are kept together their constant fighting will likely mean that some fish will become stressed and likely get sick and die. However, another factor of fish compatibility involves available territory within the aquarium. While a number of marine reef fish like Chromis, Anthias and some Tang species will readily school together within the aquarium, most reef fish attempt to stake out territory within the aquarium. This territory is usually based on feeding habits and shelter, where fish will look for an area within the aquarium that has good caves and crevices in which to retreat to when threatened and in which to sleep, and where they can readily find food to eat. Problems occur when fish are kept together and they see one another as competition for both food and shelter. An prime example of this is keeping multiple dwarf marine angelfish in small to medium sized aquariums, they will both try to claim either the entire tank or most of it as their territory, where often the loser is marginalized to one small area of the tank or simply becomes stressed, becomes ill and dies. Unless you have a very large aquarium (hundreds of gallons) it is very important to keep fish species who will not compete with one another and are accepting of sharing the same territory or space within the aquarium.

[code]

[/code]

[b]Fish Size &amp; Swimming Habits[/b]

The adult size of each fish and how much room they need to swim comfortably within the aquarium ties into the overall compatibility and ultimately the health of aquarium livestock. In general, fish species that grow larger like Angelfish, Triggerfish, Groupers, Surgeonfish and others are typically more aggressive than fish species who only grow a few inches in length. This directly effects the amount of space they need to feel comfortable within the aquarium. While smaller fish are happy to hang out near a rocky crevice or swim in a school with others of their species, larger more aggressive fish will want to claim a larger area of the aquarium and will generally not tolerate any other fish they see as competition for food or dominance. Also in the case of some fish like fast swimming open water Surgeonfish, Sharks, Rays or other similar species, their unique size and swimming habits may make them less suitable to be kept with other smaller or more shy fish species. Ultimately, fish stocking is more than just a calculation of inch of fish per gallon or employing the best filtration systems, it is a balance between fish, their tank mates and their aquarium environment.

[b]In Conclusion[/b]

Make sure you have a good understanding of the Nitrogen Cycle and how it works in an aquatic environment, utilize the best combination of filtration systems that you can afford. Be sure to cover the basics, breakdown or remove waste products, provide plenty of dissolved oxygen, export nutrients from the aquarium and provide fresh water and beneficial trace elements through water changes. And remember go slow, during the first six months to a year, give time for your filtration system to catch up each time you add new fish (usually 2 to 3 weeks) and do your best to recreate the methods mother nature uses. By providing high oxygen levels, biological filtration, protein skimming, proper color temperature (10k - 20k) lighting, controlled additions of new tank mates and keeping in mind the adult size, compatibility requirements of new specimens and you will guarantee yourself many years of successful marine fish keeping. Good Luck!

8 Water Dogs! A crash course in keeping Oscar Cichlids

Astronotus ocellatus, also known as the Oscar, is a fresh water species which is a member of the Cichlid family. Wild Oscars are native to the Amazon River basin (as well as the Orinoco and Paraguay basins) in South America. In their natural environment Oscars are typically found in slow moving, whitewater to blackwater environments and can be found taking cover around and within submerged trees, roots, rocks, vegetation and driftwood.

[code]
[/code]
Oscars are one of the hardiest and most popular Cichlids in the hobby and they can learn to distinguish their owner(s) from strangers as well as associate them with food. Oscars are very intelligent and will develop and display unique and interesting personalities. In addition to their constant &quot;begging&quot; for food, Oscars can also be trained to eat from their owner&#039;s hand; which is why they are sometimes referred to as river or water dogs.

[b]Choosing your Oscar:[/b]

The original species of Astronotus ocellatus is the Wild Oscar (also referred to as the Common Oscar); the Wild Oscar is the only Oscar that can be found in it&#039;s natural habitat in the wild (aside from various &quot;pets&quot; that have been released in ponds, lakes, canals, and rivers within sub-tropical or tropical environments). All other varieties of the Oscar have been bred exclusively for the aquarium trade, including varieties with red marbling, albino, leucistic, and xanthistic. Red Oscars, Tiger Oscars, Red Tiger Oscars, Red Lutino Oscars, Lemon Oscars, Platinum Oscars, Gold Oscars, Copper Oscars, Albino Tiger Oscars, Albino Red Oscars... the list goes on. There are also veil-tail (long-finned) versions of all the various forms in the aquarium trade, but it&#039;s not recommended that they be kept with other Oscars or aggressive Cichlids; as their fins are delicate and are prone to damage, which can cause various fin diseases or infections.

When choosing an Oscar, make sure to examine it closely before you decide to purchase it. Keep an eye out for the ones that are very alert and active. Don&#039;t choose one that is acting completely different from the rest, seems to be lethargic or just happens to be lying on the bottom of the tank pouting or possibly not feeling too well. A healthy Oscar is always alert and looking for food.

If you plan to purchase a mature Oscar, keep an eye out for any pitting or holes that may have devleoped on it&#039;s head; It&#039;s a sure sign of Hole in the Head Disease.

Also make sure your future pet Oscar does not have any small white spots (similar to tiny grains of salt) on it as it&#039;s a sure sign that it has been infected by Ick (an Ichthyophthirius multifilis parasite).

[/code]
[b]So, you brought home a new Oscar for your tank...[/b]

The water chemistry at a fish store is usually fairly neutral at a pH of around 7.0 and the GH and KH can very greatly, not to mention that it can also contain various nasty parasites. When introducing a new Oscar to a tank, you can&#039;t go wrong with the &quot;drip&quot; method as even baby Oscars have been known to tear little holes in the store bags and nobody wants fish store water in their tanks.

Carefully empty the contents of the bag (including the water) into a container. Take some airline tubing and set up a siphon drip line from the target aquarium to the container with your new Oscar. If you don&#039;t have an airline control valve handy, you can tie a couple loose knots in the airline to control the rate of water flow (it&#039;s also recommended that you secure the airline tubing in place with an airline holder or some other method). Start a siphon by sucking on the end of the airline tubing you&#039;ll be placing into the container. When water begins flowing through the tubing, it&#039;s time to adjust the drip (either by adjusting the control valve or tightening one or both of the knots) to a rate of 2-4 drips per second. When the amount of water in the bucket doubles, empty half of it and start the drip again until the volume doubles again. Repeat this process for about one hour and then your new Oscar is ready to be netted and moved to your target aquarium.

New Oscars will often pout. If your new Oscar swims to the bottom of the tank and lays on one side, looking up at you with an untrusting eye, don&#039;t panic, it may just be a little stressed and will soon get over it and snap into action, exploring its new home. Current, resident Oscars consider new Oscars a threat as well as intruders in their territory. The bigger the Oscars are, the bigger the fight can be. They will sort things out, but there maybe be a few bruises and hurt feelings in the process.

[b]In the Aquarium:[/b]

Oscars are excellent for breaking in a beginning Cichlid hobbyist as they are a very hardy species and their owner(s) will learn a lot about the care and habits of predatory fish, water conditions, filtration and how much fun it can be to have a Cichlid tank. Oscars can live for 12 to 16 years and it&#039;s important to understand that Oscars are a long-term commitment.

In their natural environment, Oscars can be found in acidic blackwater conditions as well as neutral whitewater conditions with a pH anywhere from 4.5 to 7.5. In an aquarium environment, Oscars will thrive in conditions with a pH ranging from 5.0 to 7.0 and a temperature between 74 degrees F to 84 degrees F; When it comes to water hardness, the GH should be around 3 to 7 and the KH ranging from 2 to 4.

Oscars are one of the fastest growing aquarium fish in the hobby and baby Oscars are usually sold at the fish store at around one to two inches long. Those babies will easily gain one inch a month for the first eight months. Expect those babies to be seven or eight inches by the time they are a year old. Ideally, a single Oscar should be kept in a tank that is no less than 75 gallons and a 110-125 gallon tank is recommended for two. Oscars are greedy, big and messy eaters and produce a considerable biological load within their environment. Therefore, the two most vital components for Oscars are tank size and filtration; a large tank with an efficient amount of quality filtration will play a vital role in keeping your Oscar(s) happy and healthy.

Oscars love to decorate and will rearrange their environment to their liking by digging large pits within the substrate and relocating rocks and other objects (including submersed heaters and thermometers). Oscars are very powerful fish and can and will move almost anything in the tank aside from large pieces of driftwood. As far as live plants go, Amazon and various Swords are recommended as they will grow powerful root structures and may be too difficult to move. Most other live plants will either be uprooted or shredded. Oscars have also been known to actually break heaters, filter intakes, under-gravel filter stems, and floating thermometers. Sometimes the wreckage is from an accident, other times it&#039;s on purpose as the Oscar was using that floating thermometer as a toy. If you want to give your Oscars a toy to play with, occasionally throw a clean ping-pong ball into the tank and enjoy the show.

Oscars are the beginner&#039;s species of New World Cichlids and an introduction to the more aggressive species, but despite their size (average of 14 inches in the aquarium), predatory nature, and the fact that Oscars like to play rough, they are not considered to be an aggressive species themselves, as long as their tank mates are too large to be mistaken for food (an Oscar will eat any fish that can fit its mouth). Oscars mainly show signs of aggression when they are feeding, getting ready to breed, arguing over territory, or when they want some exercise. Unlike the more aggressive Cichlids, Oscars are not known to incessantly bully or terrorize their tank mates for no apparent reason. First-time Oscar owners often panic when they see their first Oscar argument. Expect occasional arguments, that&#039;s what Oscars do; Oscars like to test their tank mates. They may try and bully other fish once in a while, but will not usually persist if the other fish can get out of their way fast enough. In addition to a nip here and a bite there, Oscars will fight and test each others strength by jaw or lip locking and will wrestle and tug on each other, which can sometimes lead to some nasty scrapes and abrasions. Don&#039;t immediately separate Oscars or tank mates when you see aggressive behavior. Observe them for a little while and see how it goes. It should become apparent if it&#039;s a short argument, a change of command, a breeding ritual, or an all out war. MelaFix is an excellent, natural medication that promotes quick tissue regeneration and wound healing and it highly recommended for any Cichlid tank.

If you end up with enough room for some tank mates to keep your Oscar(s) company, be very wary of small Catfish and small Plecos. An Oscar will eat any fish that it can fit in its mouth and Plecos and catfish have sharp, strong barbs that can kill the Oscar that gets one stuck in its mouth or throat. Catfish and Plecos can make great tank mates, but be sure to get them large enough so that an Oscar can&#039;t fit them in it&#039;s mouth. Silver Dollars and various Geophagus species also make great tank mates as they are fairly peaceful and very tough. It&#039;s possible to add other Cichlids as tank mates, but there will be arguments for sure. There have been tanks housing Oscars, Pike, Jack Dempseys, Arowana, Peacock Bass, and Managuense, but it&#039;s hit or miss and only recommended that an experienced hobbyist makes the attempt.

[b]Feeding Oscars:[/b]

The first thing that should be noted is that Oscars require vitamin C and will develop health problems in its absence.

Oscars are omnivorous (more accurately, facultative piscivores); They love live foods and enjoy the chase (your live plants won&#039;t). Feeding Oscars live fish can make them more aggressive (some hobbyists like this idea) and most readily available live feeders have little to no nutritional value. Goldfish and Rosy Red minnows should be taken out of the mix completely due to being extremely fatty and rich in a chemical called thiaminase (an enzyme that destroys the essential nutrient thiamine, also known as vitamin B1). In addition to being a catalyst for vitamin deficiency, Goldfish and Rosy Reds also have the ability to introduce some nasty parasites and bacteria into the aquarium which can cause a number of different diseases (Ick and velvet are extremely easily transmitted between feeder fish).

Baby Oscars (until they reach 1 month) should be fed 3 times a day with live, frozen, or freeze-dried: Brine shrimp, blood worms, black worms, tubifex worms, and/or small shreds of frozen krill. Once the Oscars are a little older they should also be given beef heart, white cloud minnows, ghost shrimp, and river shrimp, as well as mealworms and small Cichlid pellets. As the Oscars get more mature (5+ inches), they should be fed 2 times a day with, earthworms, frozen krill, shrimp, medium Cichlid pellets, live crickets, peas, lettuce, pieces of cooked or fresh fish, and minnows. When the Oscars grow even larger (8+ inches), they should be fed 1 to 2 times a day (2 if you give in to their begging or want them to reach full size quickly) with all of the previously mentioned foods in addition to large Cichlid pellets and cooked mussels as well as an occasional small frog, large tadpole, or crayfish. Feed your Oscars a wide variety of the foods listed and they will have all the nutrition they could ever need.

[b]Oscar Health:[/b]

Home aquariums contain insignificant volumes of water compared to an Oscar&#039;s natural environment. In the wild, Oscars rarely encounter excess amounts of ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, and harmful organisms and they are much more resistant to infection due to the relatively low concentration of harmful chemicals and organisms in such a massive volume of water. Although, in a home aquarium, biological waste can pollute the water extremely fast and if left unchecked, water chemistry can become extremely toxic to Oscars and harmful organisms can multiply exponentially and will infect them with disease and serious illness. However, if Oscars are well cared for and their water chemistry is maintained at optimal levels, Oscars can easily resist any effects from harmful organisms in very low or nonexistent concentrations.

Water changes (at least 25%) should be carried out every 2 weeks (or more or less frequently, depending how efficient your aquarium filtration is). Oscars are very hardy fish, but they are also big and messy eaters and eventually they will have health problems if their water chemistry is not maintained; filthy water is usually where &quot;one-eyed&quot; Oscars come from as well as Oscars that have developed HITH (Hole-in-the-Head) disease.

There are a number of different freshwater fish diseases and parasitic infestations out there, but the following two are the most common with Oscars:

Hole-in-the-Head Disease (HITH): Oscars are known to be susceptible to a nasty disease called Hole-in-the-Head; Other common names for this disease are Freshwater Head and Lateral Line Erosion (FHLLE) and Hexamita Disease. Nobody really knows the true cause of this disease, and although it can be fatal, if treated early and properly your Oscar can survive (aside from permanent scarring). Signs of HITH include pitted lesions on the head and lateral line. HITH will be mild at first, but if not treated, pitting will become more intense and secondary bacterial and fungal infections can develop, which will eventually lead to a severe infection and the Oscar will become systemically ill with eventual loss of appetite and life. HITH can be treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole, or a combination of MelaFix and PimaFix can be used.

Ich (Ichthyophthirius multifilis): Also referred to as White Spot, is a burrowing parasitic infestation that causes the skin of the fish to swell and produce white cysts that can be observed as small white spots covering your Oscar to varying degrees. An early symptom (before the spots are visible) is usually when your Oscars continuously scratch themselves on rocks, substrate and driftwood. In the more advanced stages, the Oscar will become lethargic and will eventually develop redness or bloody streaks across its body. Although the infestation itself is similar to a human skin infection, it can be the death of an Oscar with poor nutrition and water conditions. Ich can be treated by first doing a 25 to 50% water change, then raise your aquarium temperature to 86 degrees F, discontinue any carbon filtration, add a normal dose (listed on the box) of freshwater aquarium salt and obverse the situation for 2 weeks. If things don&#039;t clear up, repeat them again and add normal doses of MelaFix and PimaFix as well and observe for another 2 weeks. That should do the trick. One of the best ways to avoid Ich and other parasites is to quarantine new fish in a separate tank for two weeks while performing the full Ich treatment (with MelaFix and PimaFix) before introducing them to your main tank.

[code]
[/code]
One thing that every Oscar owner will have to get used to is that Oscars have a tendency to get cuts and abrasions as well as fin damage once in a while; Either from playing rough with other Oscars or tank mates, or even just bumping into various objects (heaters, driftwood, rocks, filter equipment, etc.) in the tank while chasing food, Oscars seem to always get hurt at some point and it can be quite disturbing for newcomers seeing these injuries for their first time. Although some of these injuries may look rather serious, they are actually superficial wounds and Oscars will quickly heal on their own. Keep their water clean and they will be fine. No medication is necessary, but if you want to help speed up the healing process you can add a normal dose of MelaFix to the tank to speed up the tissue regeneration process.

[b]Oscar Breeding:[/b]

Oscars are monomorphic and it&#039;s almost impossible to sex them (it is impossible to sex young Oscars), but at breeding time you will have a around 4 days to attempt to sex your Oscars; a male&#039;s breeding tube can be observed as being small and pointy where the female&#039;s egg tube is larger and more oval at the end. Unfortunately, two females will sometimes pair off and lay eggs together and several infertile clutches will eventually let you know that you have two females instead of a breeding pair. Unfertilized eggs are milky white while fertilized eggs are tanish to amber.

A breeding pair of Oscars can be conditioned for spawning by feeding them live food such as freshwater shrimp, minnows, frogs and crayfish. A pair of Oscars will usually test each other with a jaw/lip-locking, breeding ritual and once they both pass, they may chase each other around for a little while and then they will begin cleaning off rocks in the aquarium. At this time it&#039;s recommended to provide them with a large slab of slate where the female can lay her eggs as Oscars will not lay eggs on substrate. Once the Oscars clean off the area, the female will lay her eggs (up to 1000) and the male will fertilize them. While Oscars are breeding, they are extremely protective of their area and no other fish will be allowed near it.

The eggs will hatch in 3 to 5 days and the fry will look like a wiggling mass with tails, attached to the slate; as they start to absorb their yolk sacs, they will eventually fall to the substrate in a sticky blob. Once the fry are done with their yolk sacs (around 4 days), they will begin swimming on their own and will be ready to consume gargantuan quantities of baby brine shrimp (their water will need to be changed often). Because Oscars will care for their eggs and practice brood care for their newly hatched fry, it is safe to leave the fry with their parents for about a month, after which they should be relocated to another tank. Some breeders will move the slate and attached eggs to a different tank (using the same water) after they are fertilized, for fear of the parents may eat them. If the slate is relocated into another tank, the eggs will hatch on their own, but beware of Oscar attacks while trying to remove their eggs.

[b]In conclusion:[/b]

Oscars can be a lot of fun and are a great introduction to predatory fishkeeping. They are truly a species that will bring a lot of personality and activity to any freshwater Cichlid aquarium. Remember to keep their water clean and they will thrive and offer years of enjoyment and excitement for the beginner to intermediate hobbyist. Water Dogs! A crash course in keeping Oscar Cichlids

Astronotus ocellatus, also known as the Oscar, is a fresh water species which is a member of the Cichlid family. Wild Oscars are native to the Amazon River basin (as well as the Orinoco and Paraguay basins) in South America. In their natural environment Oscars are typically found in slow moving, whitewater to blackwater environments and can be found taking cover around and within submerged trees, roots, rocks, vegetation and driftwood.

Oscars are one of the hardiest and most popular Cichlids in the hobby and they can learn to distinguish their owner(s) from strangers as well as associate them with food. Oscars are very intelligent and will develop and display unique and interesting personalities. In addition to their constant "begging" for food, Oscars can also be trained to eat from their owner&#039;s hand; which is why they are sometimes referred to as river or water dogs.

[b]Choosing your Oscar:[/b]

The original species of Astronotus ocellatus is the Wild Oscar (also referred to as the Common Oscar); the Wild Oscar is the only Oscar that can be found in it&#039;s natural habitat in the wild (aside from various "pets" that have been released in ponds, lakes, canals, and rivers within sub-tropical or tropical environments). All other varieties of the Oscar have been bred exclusively for the aquarium trade, including varieties with red marbling, albino, leucistic, and xanthistic. Red Oscars, Tiger Oscars, Red Tiger Oscars, Red Lutino Oscars, Lemon Oscars, Platinum Oscars, Gold Oscars, Copper Oscars, Albino Tiger Oscars, Albino Red Oscars... the list goes on. There are also veil-tail (long-finned) versions of all the various forms in the aquarium trade, but it&#039;s not recommended that they be kept with other Oscars or aggressive Cichlids; as their fins are delicate and are prone to damage, which can cause various fin diseases or infections.

When choosing an Oscar, make sure to examine it closely before you decide to purchase it. Keep an eye out for the ones that are very alert and active. Don&#039;t choose one that is acting completely different from the rest, seems to be lethargic or just happens to be lying on the bottom of the tank pouting or possibly not feeling too well. A healthy Oscar is always alert and looking for food.

If you plan to purchase a mature Oscar, keep an eye out for any pitting or holes that may have devleoped on it&#039;s head; It&#039;s a sure sign of Hole in the Head Disease.

Also make sure your future pet Oscar does not have any small white spots (similar to tiny grains of salt) on it as it&#039;s a sure sign that it has been infected by Ick (an Ichthyophthirius multifilis parasite).

[b]So, you brought home a new Oscar for your tank...[/b]

The water chemistry at a fish store is usually fairly neutral at a pH of around 7.0 and the GH and KH can very greatly, not to mention that it can also contain various nasty parasites. When introducing a new Oscar to a tank, you can&#039;t go wrong with the "drip" method as even baby Oscars have been known to tear little holes in the store bags and nobody wants fish store water in their tanks.

Carefully empty the contents of the bag (including the water) into a container. Take some airline tubing and set up a siphon drip line from the target aquarium to the container with your new Oscar. If you don&#039;t have an airline control valve handy, you can tie a couple loose knots in the airline to control the rate of water flow (it&#039;s also recommended that you secure the airline tubing in place with an airline holder or some other method). Start a siphon by sucking on the end of the airline tubing you&#039;ll be placing into the container. When water begins flowing through the tubing, it&#039;s time to adjust the drip (either by adjusting the control valve or tightening one or both of the knots) to a rate of 2-4 drips per second. When the amount of water in the bucket doubles, empty half of it and start the drip again until the volume doubles again. Repeat this process for about one hour and then your new Oscar is ready to be netted and moved to your target aquarium.

New Oscars will often pout. If your new Oscar swims to the bottom of the tank and lays on one side, looking up at you with an untrusting eye, don&#039;t panic, it may just be a little stressed and will soon get over it and snap into action, exploring its new home. Current, resident Oscars consider new Oscars a threat as well as intruders in their territory. The bigger the Oscars are, the bigger the fight can be. They will sort things out, but there maybe be a few bruises and hurt feelings in the process.

At this time it&#039;s recommended to provide them with a large slab of slate where the female can lay her eggs as Oscars will not lay eggs on substrate. Once the Oscars clean off the area, the female will lay her eggs (up to 1000) and the male will fertilize them. While Oscars are breeding, they are extremely protective of their area and no other fish will be allowed near it.

The eggs will hatch in 3 to 5 days and the fry will look like a wiggling mass with tails, attached to the slate; as they start to absorb their yolk sacs, they will eventually fall to the substrate in a sticky blob. Once the fry are done with their yolk sacs (around 4 days), they will begin swimming on their own and will be ready to consume gargantuan quantities of baby brine shrimp (their water will need to be changed often). Because Oscars will care for their eggs and practice brood care for their newly hatched fry, it is safe to leave the fry with their parents for about a month, after which they should be relocated to another tank. Some breeders will move the slate and attached eggs to a different tank (using the same water) after they are fertilized, for fear of the parents may eat them. If the slate is relocated into another tank, the eggs will hatch on their own, but beware of Oscar attacks while trying to remove their eggs.

Oscars can be a lot of fun and are a great introduction to predatory fishkeeping. They are truly a species that will bring a lot of personality and activity to any freshwater Cichlid aquarium. Remember to keep their water clean and they will thrive and offer years of enjoyment and excitement for the beginner to intermediate hobbyist.
9 Complete guide to keeping Neon Tetra in the home aquarium

[b]Where do Neons come from?[/b]

Neon Tetras are native to the streams and small tributaries of the Amazon including areas of southeastern Colombia, northeast Peru and northern and western parts of Brazil. They thrive in blackwater and murky water areas of dense vegetation, including flood plains during the rainy season. Neon Tetras in the wild are found in large schools staying close to the lower areas of the streams and creeks in which they live, close to vegetation and root structures that afford them protection from larger predatory fish species. While it is not necessary to completely recreate their natural environment in the home aquarium, it is important to provide some key aspects of it. If you plan to keep Neon Tetras in your community freshwater aquarium, you should plan to provide areas of lower lighting with either vegetation or root structure to provide them a reasonable comfort level with their environment and a place to escape larger more aggressive species.

[b]Choosing healthy specimens and proper quantities for your aquarium[/b]

When selecting Neon Tetras for your aquarium it is important to choose healthy specimens that will be able to cope well with the transition into their new aquarium environment. Specimens should be active swimmers that swim purposely in the aquarium and do not float or drift in the water as this is a sign of poor health. Healthy specimens will also exhibit bright well defined colors that are not washed out or faded in appearance. General fish selection rules apply as well, in that the store aquarium should be clean, free of any odors and dead fish. Since the Neon Tetra is a very small fish it is a little more suseptible to fluctuations in water chemistry, so it is important to acclimate them slowely to their new environment.

[code]
[/code]
In addition, Neon Tetra are a schooling fish and should absolutely be kept in reasonable sized schools in order for them to thrive in the home aquarium. The size of the school will vary depending on aquarium size, but at least a group of 8 or more specimens should be doable in most all but the smallest aquariums. Larger schools tend to do even better as the numbers provide the Neon Tetra with a good comfort zone and feeling of safety. It is not uncommon to see schools of Neon Tetra as large as 20 to 30 fish in even moderately sized aquariums because of their relatively small size. Last but certainly not least is the sheer beauty of a large school of Neon Tetra with their vibrant color and closely grouped schools, they provide a truly impressive site within the community freshwater aquarium.

[b]Aquarium life[/b]

Neon Tetras are suitable for the beginning aquarium hobbyist, but they do require that the aquarium environment support their basic needs. In the wild, Neon Tetra generally live in water that is cooler as it is well shaded from the sun and somewhat on the acidic side, ranging from a pH of 5.0 to 7.0 and KH or 1.0 to 2.0. However, within the aquarium environment they can be acclimated to tolerate brighter lighting conditions and pH as high as 7.5 if they are brought into these conditions gradually as not to shock the fish. This is best accomplished by emptying the newly bought Neon Tetra into a container with the store bag water and the fish. Then, every 5 minutes a cup full of water can be added to the container for 20 to 30 minutes. This will give the fish time to adjust to both the water chemistry and temperature of the aquarium system. After this acclimation process is complete the fish should be netted and added to the aquarium and the water in the acclimating container should be discarded.

[code]
[/code]
Once in the aquarium, Neon Tetra should be provided plenty of places to hide if threatened; such as, live or fake plants, drift wood or root structures or large rocks. Due to their size and overall very passive nature, Neon Tetra should only be kept with other peaceful community species that will not grow large enough to eat them. While they reach just over an inch in size when fully grown, they do form tight schools that help give them protection from other larger fish species, so it is strongly recommended that this species be kept in good sized groups which will benefit their overall health and security.

[b]Sexing and Breeding[/b]

Female and Male Neon Tetras have very subtle physical differences with the female having a more round body and curvature of the blue line, while the male is more slender and has a straight blue line. The curvature of the blue line in the female is most likely due to the location of the egg sack that even when empty creates a slightly more rounded appearance to the body.

[code]
[/code]
Typically Neon Tetras are bred in conditions that closely mimic their natural surroundings including dim lighting and cooler water temperatures of around 72 to 75 degrees fahrenheit or 24 degrees celsius. The breeding aquarium should also have live plants that provide areas of the aquarium with high levels of shade and provide the fish a location to deposit their eggs. Breeders will often try to induce mating by lowering the KH to 1.0 or by letting nitrate levels rise and then replace 50% of the water with fresh RO/DI water along with brighter lighting to simulate the rainy season.

Once the eggs have been laid it is important to remove the adults as they will often eat young fry. The young are sensitive to higher lighting levels, so the lights should be maintained a low level and other water parameters should remain stable and constant. Eggs typically hatch within 24 hours and fry will reach their adult coloration within 30 days. During this time they can be fed a diet of rotifers, egg yolk, baby brine shrimp or other prepared foods formulated for newly hatched fish.

10 [color=#bed8f8][b]Canister Filtration[/b][/color]
[code]
[/code]
[color=#bed8f8][b]What is a canister filter?[/b][/color]

Like most common forms of aquarium filtration, a canister filter provides chemical, biological and physical filtration by removing water from the aquarium via an intake tube, passing the aquarium water over a series of filtration media housed within a pressurized canister, and they returning the filtered water to the aquarium via a spray bar or spray nozzle. The unique form factor of the canister filter allows for a lot of flexibility in terms of where the filter is located. Since flexible tubing is used for both the intake and return, a canister filter can be located underneath, behind or off to the side of the aquarium, with the length of the tubing and the strength of the return pump within the canister filter being the only real limiting factors. 
[code]
[/code]
[img]http://www.aquariumdomain.com/adSocial/PF.Base/file/attachment/2016/09/ac831e185931002a88910aa0508dea51_view.jpg[/img]
[code]
[/code]
The sealed and pressurized design of the canister filter also allows for very quiet operation, as the noise associated with water overflowing from the fish tank or flowing from one chamber to another as in a non-sealed aquarium filter design are kept to an absolute minimum. Being a sealed design, the canister filter can also be disconnected from the intake / return tubing and carried away for maintenance and cleaning. This design allows the hobbyist the flexibility of maintaining and cleaning the filter in a location better suited for the activity and not being forced to work underneath the aquarium or in other less than desirable locations.

[color=#bed8f8][b]How do canister filters work?[/b][/color]

Canister filters work by drawing water from the aquarium via a lift tube and through plastic tubing into the externally located canister filter. This is done via a pump that is typically located in the bottom of the canister filter. The extracted water is forced through a series of filter media layers located within the pressurized canister filter. While the exact flow of the water through the filter media can vary by models and brands of canister filters, a typical scenario has the water first passing through media designed to remove physical particles from the water, then through biological filter media and lastly through media designed for chemical filtration, before being returned to the aquarium back through plastic tubing connected to either a nozzle or spray bar.

[color=#bed8f8][b]How well do they work compared to other aquarium filtration techniques?[/b][/color]

There are a number of different filter types available within the aquarium hobby, and depending on the particular needs of an aquarium setup or the specific requirements of a hobbyist, they all have their niche. This being said, canister filtration is considered to be one of best forms of filtration for a wide variety of aquarium setups ranging from smaller freshwater or marine aquariums like nano cubes, all the way up to very large freshwater aquariums housing large Cichlid species and even larger FOWLR or predator marine fish aquariums. Hobbyists can also use multiple canister filters on the same aquarium, which allows canister filters to scale up and handle even extremely large aquariums (300 gallons plus) or aquariums with high bio-load species like Peacock Bass or freshwater Stingray.

While canister filtration can be used successfully on marine reef or larger marine fish aquariums, they are probably not the best option overall for these types of setups. Generally these larger saltwater fish or reef aquariums require large wet/dry, sump or refugium based filtration with additional foam fractioning filters like Protein Skimmers in order to provide the necessary level of filtration for complex marine aquarium environments.

[code]
[/code]
Overall though, canister filters do provide high quality filtration, have low power consumption, are cost effective and easy to maintain, which makes them a great choice for most all freshwater community aquarium setups, most all Cichlid aquarium setups, marine nano cubes and moderately sized FOWLR setups and as additional filtration on larger aquarium setups where multiple forms of filtration are required.

[color=#bed8f8][b]What sort of maintenance do canister filters require?[/b][/color]

Canister filters are designed with efficiency, application flexibility and ease of maintenance. The main portions of the filter that require periodic maintenance are contained within the main housing of the filter, where they can be easily transported to a utility sink, outside or other convenient location for cleaning. Aside from clearing algae or debris from the return nozzle or spray bar, the bulk of the maintenance required to keep a canister filter running smoothly and efficiently is centered around the chambers containing the filtration media inside the canister.

[code]
[/code]
Cleaning a canister filter mostly revolves around cleaning or changing the filter pad that captures physical particles from the water and changing out any filter bags containing activated carbon or other chemical media. The biological media (bio balls or ceramic media) typically only needs to be rinsed off from time to time if physical debris is able to build up within the tray containing the bio media. Be sure to use aquarium water or non-chlorinated tap water to rinse off the bio media, this is important in order to not kill off any of the beneficial bacteria living on the media by putting it in contact with the chlorine present in most tap water. Hobbyists should also occasionally pull out all of the media trays and rinse and wipe down the inside of the canister to remove any algae growth or detritus that has built up on the inside of the filter, as this will reduce water flow and ultimately reduce the effectiveness of the filter. 

In terms of how often a canister filter should be cleaned, it varies widely based on the sizing of the canister filter vs. the aquarium size, the fish load, the type of fish and feeding regime; however, it is safe to say that most canister filters will need some attention basic cleaning of the physical filter pad every 1 to 2 months and a more thorough cleaning at least every 4 months. While many hobbyists go longer periods of time; often up to 6 months, their filter are most likely quite dirty and their capability significantly degraded by 6 months of use.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Our opinion on the best uses for canister filters[/b][/color]

So canister filters come in a wide variety of models, designs and capabilities, but is canister filtration the right filtration for your particular tank? 

The short answer is that it depends mostly on the size of your aquarium and your budget. While in theory a canister filter or a combination of multiple canister filters can provide proper filtration for essentially any home aquarium (assuming you don&#039;t have a 2000 gallon home aquarium), it may not always be the best form of filtration or the most cost effective form of filtration.

[b]Here are the best uses for canister filtration, listed by the most ideal to least ideal situation:[/b]
[ul]
[li][b]Medium to large sized freshwater fish aquariums:[/b] These are aquariums that are generally between 30 to 300 gallons in size and contain Freshwater community, New World Cichlid or African Cichlid fish species.[/li]
[li][b]Larger New World Cichlid or African Cichlid freshwater fish aquariums:[/b] These are larger aquariums 125 to 450 gallons in size where multiple high-end canister filters can be combined to handle the substantial filtration requirements of larger Cichlid species.[/li]
[li][b]Smaller freshwater fish aquariums:[/b] These are freshwater fish or planted aquariums that typically range between 10 to 30 gallons in size. While these can be adequately filtered via power filters or even internal filters, a small canister filter will also do an excellent job at a slightly higher upfront cost.[/li]
[li][b]Smaller to medium sized marine fish aquariums:[/b] These are generally fish-only or FOWLR (fish only with live rock) aquariums ranging from 20 to 125 gallons in size. While a canister filter is not the ideal form of filtration for a marine aquarium, when combined with a hang-on protein skimmer it can provide excellent filtration for marine aquariums setups housing primarily fish.[/li]
[/ul]

[b]Here are the situations where a canister filter is either a poor choice or won&#039;t work well at all:[/b]
[ul]
[li][b]Coral reef aquariums:[/b] These are marine aquariums supporting a variety of Corals, invertebrates and fishes, which essentially require sump based filters, protein skimmers, extra internal water flow via powerheads or wave makers and either refugiums or algae scrubbers to really thrive. While canister filters can provide supplemental filtration in this type of aquarium setup, they are poorly suited to be the main filtration method.[/li]
[li][b]Extra large freshwater or marine aquariums:[/b] These are tanks that exceed 450 gallons and are not well suited for even multiple canister filters. Due to their large scale, these tanks are better suited for larger scale filtration techniques similar to those found in commercial aquaculture, ie. bead filters, tower filters, etc.[/li]
[li][b]Nano aquariums:[/b] These are smaller aquariums (often cube shaped) that are intended for micro environments like mini reefs or freshwater shrimp. Generally this type of setup can be filtered more efficiently and at a lower cost by filtration techniques other than canister filters.[/li]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Our opinion on the best uses for canister filters[/b][/color]

So canister filters come in a wide variety of models, designs and capabilities, but is canister filtration the right filtration for your particular tank? 

The short answer is that it depends mostly on the size of your aquarium and your budget. While in theory a canister filter or a combination of multiple canister filters can provide proper filtration for essentially any home aquarium (assuming you don&#039;t have a 2000 gallon home aquarium), it may not always be the best form of filtration or the most cost effective form of filtration.

[b]Here are the best uses for canister filtration, listed by the most ideal to least ideal situation:[/b]
[ul]
[li][b]Medium to large sized freshwater fish aquariums:[/b] These are aquariums that are generally between 30 to 300 gallons in size and contain Freshwater community, New World Cichlid or African Cichlid fish species.[/li]
[li][b]Larger New World Cichlid or African Cichlid freshwater fish aquariums:[/b] These are larger aquariums 125 to 450 gallons in size where multiple high-end canister filters can be combined to handle the substantial filtration requirements of larger Cichlid species.[/li]
[li][b]Smaller freshwater fish aquariums:[/b] These are freshwater fish or planted aquariums that typically range between 10 to 30 gallons in size. While these can be adequately filtered via power filters or even internal filters, a small canister filter will also do an excellent job at a slightly higher upfront cost.[/li]
[li][b]Smaller to medium sized marine fish aquariums:[/b] These are generally fish-only or FOWLR (fish only with live rock) aquariums ranging from 20 to 125 gallons in size. While a canister filter is not the ideal form of filtration for a marine aquarium, when combined with a hang-on protein skimmer it can provide excellent filtration for marine aquariums setups housing primarily fish.[/li]
[/ul]

[b]Here are the situations where a canister filter is either a poor choice or won&#039;t work well at all:[/b]
[ul]
[li][b]Coral reef aquariums:[/b] These are marine aquariums supporting a variety of Corals, invertebrates and fishes, which essentially require sump based filters, protein skimmers, extra internal water flow via powerheads or wave makers and either refugiums or algae scrubbers to really thrive. While canister filters can provide supplemental filtration in this type of aquarium setup, they are poorly suited to be the main filtration method.[/li]
[li][b]Extra large freshwater or marine aquariums:[/b] These are tanks that exceed 450 gallons and are not well suited for even multiple canister filters. Due to their large scale, these tanks are better suited for larger scale filtration techniques similar to those found in commercial aquaculture, ie. bead filters, tower filters, etc.[/li]
[li][b]Nano aquariums:[/b] These are smaller aquariums (often cube shaped) that are intended for micro environments like mini reefs or freshwater shrimp. Generally this type of setup can be filtered more efficiently and at a lower cost by filtration techniques other than canister filters.[/li]

99 I have always wanted a nano-tank or a small self-sufficient tank for the office.  My old  boss used to have a 5-10g with a planted hood, with just a few tetras and guppies in his office.

100 Sounds very interesting! I would think that a Marine Biology education should help in making an awesome aquarium setup. Keeping high quality water in a smaller tank is even more critical than in the big tanks where we often use a &quot;no replacement for displacement&quot; water volume / water change regimen. :-) Sounds very interesting!

101 Yea it has really helped a lot in understanding the various component interactions and what needs to be done about fixing problems systematically instead of on a whim.  Planted tanks especially!  When you say &quot;little tank&quot; I think 10-20g...what is a &quot;big&quot; tank?!  36+ for me is huge!

We currently don't have the Video section opened up to all members posting videos because we are still working on some features on the backend of the system to allow us to manage member contributed videos properly.

However, if you would like to email me the video at admin@aquariumdomain.com, I would be happy to upload the "Member Videos" section and attribute the video to yourself.

Thank you and welcome to AquariumDomain.com!

AquariumDomain Admin

PS. Loving the pics of your setup, very nice design! 1501080340 0 0 0
10 133 971 0 0 What type of work do you do as an aquatic biologist?  

I am looking forward to seeing where you take this little tank. I have generally kept big tanks with big Cichlids, but admit that I have an itch for a non-Cichlid desktop tank. 1506706496 4 0 0

61 Welcome to Reef-A-Palooza California

Reef-A-Palooza provides the perfect venue for marine aquarium hobbyists to meet fellow enthusiasts, exchange information, and trade, and learn about new products. One of our main goals at Reef-A-Palooza, and within SCMAS, is to educate and enlighten the public with the latest knowledge in marine animal husbandry skills and environmental responsibility. For instance, SCMAS fully encourages the rapid advancement and allure of coral propagation as a viable alternative to wild harvest collection practices. 

As such, many of our booth exhibitors are local hobbyists who grow their own corals specifically to sell and trade at Reef-A-Palooza and similar events. SCMAS thoroughly encourages this type of âgreen commerceâ for both the betterment and future of our hobby, as well as the resulting benefit to the marine environment.

Reef-A-Palooza California 2019 is proud to announce that we will be at the Anaheim Marriott. Book your room now at the official venue of Reef-A-Palooza California.

6 I have recently found a large piece of driftwood on the bank of my local river. I&#039;m not sure what kind of wood it is since there is no bark on it. I have two concerns. 1 is that it is too large to boil so how can I be sure it is safe for tank use? 2 Are there any types of wood that should never go into a tank? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I have recently found a large piece of driftwood on the bank of my local river.

7 Hey Adam, Welcome to AquariumDomain!

Ideally you would definitely want to boil any wood you find outside, usually they have been exposed to pollutants or toxins and will contain both algae spores and fungus that you will not want to introduce to your tank. So if at all possible, boil the wood for 1.5 to 2 hours in order to completely clean and cure it. This will also help remove the tannins in wood, which will discolor the water in your tank.

If at all possible boil the wood, but if you can&#039;t I would suggest letting the wood air dry, scrub it very well with soap and water and a coarse scrubbing brush, rinse it, let it air dry again and then add it to the aquarium.

Also, unless you want to increase tannins in the water, it is best to soak the wood in tub, trash can, etc. with a powerhead and activate carbon to remove excess tannins and chemicals released from the wood.

As far as wood that should never go into an aquarium, you don&#039;t want to put any wood that has not already been submerged in water for a long time ie. nothing from the yard. Wood with sap or softwoods are also don&#039;t do well. Any hardwood that you find submerged in rivers and has already been &quot;processed&quot; by nature so to speak, should be OK after cleaning and sterilizing. Hey Adam, Welcome to AquariumDomain!

8 If all of the bark is gone from the wood that is a good sign that nature has done its job in preparing the wood. I was thinking that maybe if the wood is too big to boil that it could be baked in the oven at low temperature to kill the bad stuff on the wood but not discolor or catch the wood on fire.

9 I have pulled quite a few pieces of driftwood out of the brackish waters off the Chesapeake Bay near my home that were well aged and submerged in either saltwater or brackish water. Boiling is the best method by far, but I have had plenty of pieces that were too big, so I pressure wash them with a cheap home depot pressure washer and them scrub them down with soapy water and a potato brush.  Then just rinse them off really well before putting them in your tank.

I have probably added about 12 to 15 pieces of wood this way over 20 years and never had a problem. 

After adding the wood you may see a fuzz grow on it after a few weeks to a month after the driftwood is added to the aquarium. Folks in the aquarium club I belong to say it is either a fungus or a mold, but either way it&#039;s harmless. You can either brush it off or algae eating fish will actually eat it.

10 I am in the process of moving and building out a new fish room in the basement of my new place, which is going to take a while as I am building some custom tanks and filtration. In the mean time though, I am setting up my 93 gallon cube aquarium in my office area. It is going to be a freshwater planted community tank; however, I am doing a couple of things with the substrate and filtration that are a bit different than the average aquarium setup.

First, I am going with a dirt substrate capped off with fluorite gravel and secondly in addition to both a canister filter and hang-on power filter, I will also be using an overflow and sump. Yeah, this is definitely going a bit overboard on the filtration, but I want to heavily stock the tank and since I keep quite a few aquariums it is important to go a little over kill on the filtration and automation to keep them manageable for myself.

I am going to use the sump exclusively for nutrient export in the form of growing vegetables using aquaponics. Between the live plants in the aquarium and growing vegetables in the sump I am hoping to eliminate excess nitrates and the corresponding nuisance algae. Plus if I can grow some veggies to feed to both my freshwater and saltwater herbivores, then all the better.

The tank is in the early stages of cycling, ie. diatom algae and cloudy water, but it is coming along.  Here is a few pics of some of the equipment I am using and the tank as it looks as of 2-12-2017.

95 Hello all!  New to AD and planted tanks.

I have a 36g bowfront that is about 4-5 weeks into its life.  I have 3 dwarf sag, 1 amazon sword, 2 small anubias, a handful of moneywort, and a handful of Brazilian pennywort/Chinese ivy.  Currently going through the brown algae phase and, while it isn&#039;t everywhere, it is primarily on the plant leaves and it&#039;s concerning me that the plants aren&#039;t doing well.  Is this a rational fear? Nothing is dead, yet, and I have 5 corys and a dwarf gourami to kinda keep the nitrogen cycle moving forward.  Water chem monitored weekly and 20% water change weekly TD.

Any advice/recommendations of what to do/not do moving forward? Thanks! Hello all!  New to AD and planted tanks.

96 Hi Joe, welcome to AquariumDomain and the forums!

You have a fair mix of plants and a new (partially established) tank which is definitely a recipe for some water quality and overall plant health fluctuations. As you are going through the brown algae (diatom) phase right now, this means that the nitrogen cycle is just getting established in your tank. 

Depending on the water source, stocking, feeding, etc. it will probably be another 4-5 weeks until you have nice consistent water parameters that you can then monitor for nitrate levels or monitor through the plants growth/reaction to the water parameters. Long term you are going to be looking for a consistent nitrate reading somewhere around 20ppm, which is low enough not to bother fish, but high enough to provide food for your plants.

A great fish addition for any planted tank is the [link=https://www.aquariumdomain.com/adSocial/index.php/otocinclus-catfish/]Otocinclus Catfish[/link], which does an amazing job of keeping algae off of delicate plant leaves without damaging the plant.

Keep in mind with new aquarium plants that a lot of these farm raised plants are grown not fully submerged in order to maximize lighting and grow the plants more quickly and ready for sale; however, this also causes the plants to melt back or die back when put into aquariums where the are fully submerged. Often plant leaves and overall shape will vary greatly from the plant grown in a bog environment vs. submerged. It can be very scary for the hobbyists to watch this process take place. Also many hobbyists pull the plant out thinking it is dead, when in fact it will typically grow back and take on it submerged environment form.

Lighting, substrate (for root feeding plants) and liquid plant foods (iron, potassium, etc.) water temperature, etc. all greatly effect plant health and growth. You have a mix of plants with low, medium and medium-high lighting requirements, so depending on what type of lights you are running and the par levels where the plants are placed, you may need to move the plants around accordingly.

You also have a mix of stem, rhizome and peduncle/stalk plants in your tank, which means some of these feed mainly from their root structure via nitrogen, iron and phosphate available in the substrate, while others are water column feeders. So depending on what type of substrate you have, you may need to utilize root tab feeding in addition to a liquid plant food.

Lastly, make sure have good water movement, with really no areas in the tank that aren&#039;t receiving at least some consistent water movement. Very important part of a healthy tank is to keep solids suspended, keep chemical compounds in the water moving and greatly supports a healthy biological/nitrogen cycle within the tank.

Sorry for the big brain dump :-)   Definitely give your new plants plenty of time to adjust to your tank and the fact that your tank is still settling in and also try to keep an on the plants and make sure they are not showing signs of discontent (not enough/too much lighting, etc.). Please feel free to post any question you have here as I know there are others who use the site who are very knowledgeable about freshwater fish and plants....they just tend to lurk and reply to posts more so than starting their own threads :-)

P.S. Would love to see some pics of your tank setup!

97 Melt back is for real, can&#039;t tell you how many new plants I have bought and had them appear to be completely dead only to grow back in a new form. I have taken to the habit now of growing new plants out in my sump which has an area with the same lighting and substrate (water of course) as my main tank. Then after they have fully melted back, adjusted to my tank and are growing well do I move them into my display tank.

98 AD Admin, thanks for the input! All of my actions have been driven by either forums, posts, topic pages, etc. so the fact that everything is still green is a plus in my book.  I use city water (treated with StressCoat+ to dechlorinate) and have measured hardness (&lt;100 for either KH or GH), pH, No2/No3, etc. and everything has been pretty stable. I was looking into getting some Oto&#039;s but was hesitant to add more fish after reading several things that they are relatively short lived and that the diatom bloom is kinda a &quot;phase.&quot;  They seem like good additions either way, I guess...

Didn&#039;t know about the meltback topic, so thanks both for that!  I&#039;ll try and get pics up soon. AD Admin, thanks for the input!

99 I currently dose a 50% strength v/v solution of Flourish every other day, no CO2, I have a Maxi-Jet 400 powerhead for agitation and flow and a 30&quot; Finnex Planted Plus 24/7 light.  I have yet to find out any actual PAR specs and wattage stuff for the light.  I was also doing 24/7 transitional photoperiod, but read that the lighting needed to be a bit shorter starting out (around 6-8hrs).  Is this true? and Do I need to stop dosing for now?

100 I run the same Finnex Planted Plus 24/7 lighting on two of my tanks and I find that they are great for low light and some medium light plants. They will keep medium-high plants alive but in my experience they didn&#039;t thrive. In my tank with swords and dwarf hair-grass I added an additional 6700k light that runs 8 hours a day in addition to the Finnex Planted Plus 24/7 and now all the plants are popping.

I always run either dirt / sand substrate or something like fluorite or eco-complete in my planted tanks, so I tend to dose liquid fertilizers at about 50% of what is recommended on the label.

Both with lighting and ferts my advice is to start off like you have and look at how the plants respond and adjust accordingly. Definitely safer to under do it than to over do it and create a giant algae bloom mess :-) I run the same Finnex Planted Plus 24/7 lighting on two of my tanks and I find that they are great for low light and some medium light plants.

I feel like my Oto&#039;s tend to last 2 or 3 years, I know they are supposed to live 3 to 5 years but mine always seen to disappear before that. I buy a half dozen or so every year for my big planted tank to keep the population strong and my tank free of algae, plus they are only a couple of bucks each in my area. [quote=971]

Do you run the 24/7 on the cycle setting for the full 24hrs? What would you recommend for my tank as far as an equivalent light to you 6700K (for future consideration)?

I also have a fluorite base, but I think I made the mistake of mixing it with a gravel that is too big (probably 5-10mm? not a good judge of that unit).  Problem? It looks pretty decent and the fluorite is settling out some (which is kinda what I wanted) [quote=1]

Yeah, I run the 24/7 cycle for the full 24 hrs on both tanks and have a separate timers running a Current USA Satellite Freshwater LED Light for Aquarium in White mode on one tank and a Finnex FugeRay Aquarium LED Light on the other. I have the non 24/7 light overlapping some into the evening hours so that the tank is brighter in the evening when I am home from work. In the morning and late evening it is only the Finnex 24/7 light which gives the tank some really cool dimly lit time periods. [quote=971]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

The Albino Angelfish is an omnivore and should be fed a variety of foods including vegetables as well as meaty foods. Feed a quality flake food as well as live and frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms and tubfex worms. They are particularly fond of bloodworms and it is even believed that feeding Angelfish bloodworms will help stimulate breeding behavior. 

Albino Angelfish are an albino strain of the species (Pterophyllum sp.) of Anglefish, whose coloration ranges from a white and silver coloration to a yellowish orange coloration with pink eyes. The Albino Angel hails from the warm temperate waters of the Amazon basin in South America, where it is found in calm waterways and flood plains. Albino Angels are found living in areas with losts of plants or tree roots, which they use for protection against larger fish species and as a place to hunt insect larvae and other foodstuffs. 

These days this species is more commonly tank bred in the United States and parts of Southern Asia, than collected from the wild. They have long been sought after in the aquarium hobby because of their brilliant black body coloration and long flowing fins. Their long fins mean that they should not be kept with fish species that will nip or tear their fins. Many so called fin nipping species can be kept easily with angelfish as long as the fin nippers are kept in groups of 4 or more, so that they will nip at each other and ignore the angelfish. In a small or medium sized aquarium the Albino Angel is best kept in a mated pair, in larger aquariums they can be kept in groups of 6 or more individuals.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Albino Angelfish will do well in aquariums that are 30 gallons or larger and have plenty of plants and/or driftwood. As a group freshwater Angelfish are territorial and will squabble with one another until a dominant male is established. They can be kept singularly, in mated pairs or in medium sized groups of 6 or more. Contrary to popular belief, long finned species like the Albino Angelfish can be kept with barbs and other fin nipping species. 

The key here is that the barbs be kept in proper sized groups, so that they nip at each other instead of nipping at the Angelfish or other species that are not equipped for this type of behavior. Barbs prefer to be kept in groups and their nipping at each other is normal behavior that will not hurt them at all; however, this behavior is too boisterous for many other fish species and damaging to long finned fish species. 

Angelfish in general require fairly constant water parameters and are less forgiving than many other freshwater community species towards fluctuations in pH or temperature. Like with most South American cichlid species, the Albino Angelfish prefers soft, slightly acidic water with temperatures that stay between 79 and 83 degrees.

[/code]
[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Aequidens pulcher, also known as the Blue Acara, is a very attractive and hardy species that originates within still to slow moving waters in Central and South America. 

Blue Acara are often confused with their more aggressive relative, the Green Terror (Aequidens rivulatus). They have a tannish base color with vertical, dark striping on the body. The most beautiful and distinctive feature of the Blue Acara is the electric, blue-green, iridescent markings over their operculums (gill covers). 

They have metallic, gold-green hued scales on their flanks that become translucent at their fins. Their caudal and dorsal fins end with an orange outline. A male Blue Acara will have more elongated dorsal and anal fins than a female.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Blue Acara require an aquarium of at least 45 gallons and should be provided with a fine substrate and multiple places where they can find shelter (driftwood, rock structures, or dense vegetation). 

While they appreciate the pressence of live plants in the aquarium, they have been known to dig while breeding and can cause some uprooting. Although they are generally considered to be a peaceful species and have been successfully kept in Community aquariums, the Blue Acara can show aggression; even more so during breeding. 

Blue Acaras will bully small fish and eat the tiny ones, therefore, tank mates should be considered carefully and should be comparable in size. 

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Blue Acara is an omnivore and should be fed a variety of foods, such as frozen or freeze-dried brine shrimp, bloodworms, blackworms, flake food, and Cichlid pellets. 

They relish live food and should occasionally be provided with live brine shrimp, guppies, minnows, shrimp, worms, and crickets.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Blue Acara are dimorphic, egg layers that practice brood care. To induce breeding and sustain the ideal breeding environment, the water temperature should be raised to and maintained at about 86Â°Â F. 

The female Blue Acara will lay from 150-250 eggs in a carefully cleaned and selected location (driftwood, rocks, stones, slate, large plant leaves, etc). The eggs will hatch in 2-3 days and the fry should be swimming around within a week. A pair of Blue Acara will continue to breed every two weeks if the fry are constantly removed shortly after they hatch. 

The newly hatched fry can be fed a diet of baby brine shrimp and then moved to other foods as they mature.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

Pseudotropheus Acei are typically found on the Northwestern areas of Lake Malawi in Zambia, Africa. Their bright blue and yellow coloration and interesting banded markings on both their fins and body have made them a long time favorite of African Cichlid enthusiasts. Pseudotropheus Acei tends to become highly aggressive towards the same species when they do not have sufficient space to claim a suitable territory, but are otherwise considered to be fairly peaceful. 

However, many hobbyists have great success with crowding African Cichlids, which means that no one individual can establish their own territory. This essentially creates a balance within the aquarium and spreads any aggression from dominant specimens amongst many tank mates, which keeps any one fish from being stressed to death. Overall there is little to differentiate a male Acei Cichlid from a female, other than the males bearing egg spots on the back edge of the anal fin. 

Overall the Pseudotropheus Acei is a popular species and definitely worth a chance for beginners and advanced hobbyists alike. They are generally easy to find at local and online retailers and sell for very reasonable prices.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Pseudotropheus Acei will do best when housed in an aquarium of 75 gallons or more, and are provided with a fine sand substrate, multiple rocky formations or along with moderate water flow and small amounts of vegitation, that will simulate their natural environment. 

They prefer open space and should be provided with enough room to swim around freely. They should be fine with live plants, but have been known to eat them sometimes in their diet. Pseudotropheus Acei are normally fine with tank mates that do not share their appearance or species, but they should be similar in size and disposition. 

A larger tank, 6 foot long or more, will be needed if another male Pseudotropheus Acei is ever planned as a new addition, unless the tank is crowded with specimens and no one dominant male is able to establish his own territory.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Acei Cichlid are herbivores who in their native habitat feed primarily on algae covered rocks and submerged wood. They are also known to graze on multiple types of aquatic vegitation, thus making them not as well suited as most African Cichlids for a planted aquarium environment. However, they should be fine with tougher plants like Java Ferns or many Anubias plant species. 

Hobbyists typically provide Acei Cichlids with a quality herbivore flake or pellet food, along with supplemental algae wafers and of course naturally occuring algae growth on the rock and wood aquarium decor.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

For hobbyists looking to breed Acei Cichlid, they will more quickly facilitate spawning by keeping a single male specimen with at least three females. Pseudotropheus Acei are maternal mouthbrooders, with the female cichlid laying her eggs and immediately gathering them up in her mouth. 

The female will then be attracted to the egg-like spots on the males anal fin, thinking that they are more eggs to gather up in her mouth; she will then try to gather and will receive sperm from the male, thus fertilizing the eggs. The female will carry the eggs (usually a clutch of 25-50) for around 25 days before she releases free-swimming fry. The fry can then be fed newly hatched brine shrimp, Artemia nauplii, daphnia, or crushed flake food.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

Pseudotropheus Acei are typically found on the Northwestern areas of Lake Malawi in Zambia, Africa. Their bright blue and yellow coloration and interesting banded markings on both their fins and body have made them a long time favorite of African Cichlid enthusiasts. Pseudotropheus Acei tends to become highly aggressive towards the same species when they do not have sufficient space to claim a suitable territory, but are otherwise considered to be fairly peaceful. 

However, many hobbyists have great success with crowding African Cichlids, which means that no one individual can establish their own territory. This essentially creates a balance within the aquarium and spreads any aggression from dominant specimens amongst many tank mates, which keeps any one fish from being stressed to death. Overall there is little to differentiate a male Acei Cichlid from a female, other than the males bearing egg spots on the back edge of the anal fin. 

Overall the Pseudotropheus Acei is a popular species and definitely worth a chance for beginners and advanced hobbyists alike. They are generally easy to find at local and online retailers and sell for very reasonable prices.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

The African Water Fern, sometimes referred to as the Congo Fern, is a true aquatic plant species that can be found submerged in various lakes, rivers, and streams of tropical South Africa. Its elegant leaves can range from bright to dark green in color and provide an attractive contrast to other aquarium plants. 

African Water Ferns are considered to be a slow-growing species, but once it&#039;s acclimated and has been established for a few months, its rate of growth can increase dramatically (which can also be enhanced by stronger lighting). The African Water Fern is easy to care for and can thrive in low light conditions; making it a great choice for beginners.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

The African Water Fern will fair well with a low-light intensity of 1 watt per gallon from full spectrum (5000-7000K) bulbs, but can also handle medium to high intensity (and may grow more quickly). Although this species has no special nutrient or CO2 requirements, a nutrient-rich substrate, vitamin supplementation, and mild CO2 injection would greatly increase its rate of growth. 

A well established African Water Fern can make an ideal focus point in an aquarium or multiple specimens can be used in the background or rear corners of the aquarium to provide contrast with other species and additional shelter for tank inhabitants. The rhizome of this species should not be buried in the substrate, but should be utilized in a method similar to Java Fern and various Anubias species; simply attach the rhizome to a piece of driftwood or rock using some thread or fishing line and the plant will eventually become attached by small anchoring roots in the driftwood, rock, or substrate. 

This species is great for slightly soft, acidic water as well as the slightly harder, more alkaline conditions associated with African cichlid environments. The African Water fern also appreciates being located in an area of the aquarium with a current or decent amount of water movement.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Propagation Information[/b][/color]

Propagation of the African Water Fern is relatively easy and is done by dividing the plant at the rhizome (root) with very sharp, sterilized scissors and placing the &quot;new&quot; specimen in the desired location. The new plants obtained from propagation make excellent, bright green accent plants, while the larger, more mature specimens will take on a dark green coloration. 

For maintenance the leaves can be pruned by clipping the frond at the base of the rhizome, which will keep the plant in check as well as proportional to the desired aquascape of the aquarium.

The Banded Shark is also commonly referred to as a Cat Shark because the barbells at the mouth look like cat whiskers; however, it is actually a species of bamboo shark and is generally known as the Brown Banded Bamboo Shark. The Banded  Bamboo Shark is a very popular shark species for aquarium hobbyists as it does not attain as large a size as many other shark species do and it has a moderate temperament, which allows it to be kept with a variety of larger fish species. 

While this species can be kept with many different fish species, it will eat any crustacean that it comes across. As will other bottom dwelling shark species, the Banded Bamboo Shark should only be kept with a soft substrate; such as, sand so as not to scratch or irritate its abdomen.

Banded Bamboo Sharks can vary in color from black and tan bands to brown and tan bands. While this species does have a shark look, it is a little less shark like in appearance than Horn, Nurse and Leopard sharks. The dorsal fin it set a ways back on the body which along with its narrow body gives this species a long slender look. There may be large, muted brown spots between the stripes when the fish gets larger.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

The Banded Shark is a bottom dwelling shark that is common in the home aquarium because of its relatively small size (40&quot;) and moderate temperament. It will eat any crustacean or mollusk present in the aquarium and may eat small fish. The Banded Shark stays relatively small, but requires at least a 180 gallon or larger aquarium as an adult. 

While most shark species require an aquarium that is at least as wide as the shark is long, the Banded Bamboo Shark does not have this requirement as its body is very slender and flexible. Unlike many shark species, the Banded Bamboo Shark can be kept easily with other hardy species ranging from large Tangs and Angelfish to Groupers. It requires sand as the substrate as the abdomen is easily scratched by a coarser substrate, which may lead to an infection. It should never be exposed to copper-based medications.

All sharks including the Brown Banded Bamboo shark have thick bodies and will produce a much higher bio-load than a typical aquarium fish species. It is very important that aquariums housing sharks have excellent biological and mechanical filtration in order to maintain the water quality at a very high level. 

It is also very important to provide a very high level of dissolved oxygen in the water as the majority of tropical reef sharks live in water that is highly oxygenated and will have a very low tolerance for lower dissolved oxygen levels. High quality and highly oxygenated water will help the shark maintain a strong immune system and will greatly increase their lifespan within an aquarium environment.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

When the Banded Shark is first introduced to the aquarium, it may be difficult to feed in the beginning. When first introduced into the aquarium, small pieces of cleaned squid or live saltwater feeder shrimp should be used to entice this fish to eat. Then the Banded Shark should be fed shrimp, scallops or pieces of fresh marine fish. Feeding Banded sharks quality foods such as whole cockle in the shell, fresh shrimp and squid, and frozen mussel are ideal.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

Nandopsis octofasciatum, commonly known as the Jack Dempsey, also has a less common, natural variant which is specifically known as the Electric Blue Jack Dempsey. The Electric Blue Jack Dempsey is an intensely colorful and extremely hardy Cichlid native to still and slow moving bogs, lakes, ponds and swamps in Central America. 

They are one of the most popular species in the hobby and are known for their territorial instincts as well as the intense coloration they can bring to any aquarium. They have a gray-blue base color with vivid, iridescent, electric blue to purplish scales mosaicked with dark to black coloration. Electric Blue Jack Dempsey can also have (to varying intensity) black splotching on their lateral lines. Males will also grow out to be much larger than the females.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Electric Blue Jack Dempsey require an aquarium of at least 55 gallons and should be provided with multiple places where they can find shelter (driftwood, rock structures (especially caves), and dense vegetation). In addition to a good hiding place, Electric Blue Jack Dempsey appreciate clean, acidic to neutral water as well as live plants, but have been known to dig, which will cause some uprooting. 

While they can be quite territorial and aggressive as they grow in size, which can lead to weaker or smaller fish being bullied, they can be kept with a wide range of fish species who have a similar size and temperament. Tank mates should be considered carefully with the size of the aquarium, amount of available territory and long term compatibility based on the adult fish size and temperament taken into consideration.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

As an omnivorous species, the Electric Blue Jack Dempsey should be fed a variety of foods, such as live, frozen or freeze-dried ghost shrimp, minnows, shrimp, crickets, bloodworms, blackworms, earthworms, flake food, and Cichlid pellets.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

The Electric Blue Jack Dempsey is an egg layer, who also practices brood care. For the ideal breeding environment, the water temperature should be raised to and maintained at 84-86Â° F and the pH stablized on the more acidic side. The female Electric Blue Jack Dempsey will lay around 650 eggs in a carefully cleaned location (driftwood, rocks, stones, slate, large plant leaves, etc). 

The eggs will hatch in 2-3 days and the fry should be free-swimming within a week. The newly hatched fry should be fed a diet of baby brine shrimp or crushed flake food and then moved to other foods as they mature.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

The Blue Mushroom Coral (Actinodiscus sp.) is a hardy and easy to maintain species, which is also very colorful and enjoyable to keep. Blue Mushroom Corals are also referred to as Mushroom Anemones, Actinodiscus Mushroom and Disc Anemones. This variety of mushroom coral varies in color from a light blue/green to an emerald green depending on lighting and aquarium conditions. They will also fluoresce when kept under actinic lighting. Blue Mushroom Corals are a wonderful invertebrate for bottom placement in a reef aquarium, which over time will reproduce forming a carpet covering the rock work and nearby sand in a brilliant fluorescent green.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

In general, Blue Mushroom Corals will prosper with only a medium light intensity, and should be placed in the lower areas of an aquarium if kept under high intensity reef lighting. Blue Mushroom Corals require a low to moderate indirect water flow in which to provide supplementary food sources such as photo-plankton and carry away waste products created by the coral. Too direct or too intense a water flow will inhibit the Blue Mushroom Coral from fully expanding and will overtime lead to poor health. 

Optimum placement for this species is on the bottom of the aquarium in a spot with indirect water flow. Bottom placement will also keep the Blue Mushroom Coral from receiving too intense lighting; as well as, allow it to grow outward. When placing the Blue Mushroom Coral also keep in mind that it is a semi-aggressive species that will require adequate space between itself and other corals or sessile invertebrates (also note that this species will grow out horizontally over time).

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Blue Mushroom Coral receives most of its nutritional requirements through the photosynthesis of the symbiotic algae zooxanthellae, which it hosts. However, it also feeds on other nutrients and particle matter present in established marine aquariums. The Blue Mushroom Coral will also benefit from additional feedings in the form of micro-plankton or other foods designed for filter feeding invertebrates. 

Each mushroom polyp in the colony is a distinct individual, thus supplemental foods should be gently sprayed over the entire colony to make sure that each polyp has an opportunity to feed.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

The Blood Red Fire Shrimp is also commonly known as Blood Shrimp, Fire Shrimp, or Scarlet Cleaner Shrimp within the aquarium hobby. The Blood Red Fire Shrimp is by far one of the most popular shrimp in the aquarium hobby because of its bright blood-red body with white spots and long white antennae. 

Depending on which region of the Indo-Pacific from which it originates, it may have the white dots just on its carapace, or covering its entire body. This species is not only very attractive, but it also serves the roles of aquarium cleaner and remover of parasites.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

The Blood Red Fire Shrimp requires an aquarium habitat providing it with caves, crevices or overhangs where the lighting is not too intense. While it will tolerate its mate, others of its own kind will be chased away or harassed. 

The Blood Red Fire Shrimp is generally peaceful with most other organisms in the reef system unless they infringe on its territory. As a &quot;cleaner shrimp,&quot; it will set up cleaning stations and remove dead tissue and parasites from fish that present themselves for cleaning. The Blood Red Fire Shrimp is also an excellent scavenger and will move along the reef or substrate bottom looking for any meaty foods. 

As with most all marine invertebrates this species is very intolerant of copper or high levels of nitrates in the aquarium. It is important to provide proper levels of iodine in the water to promote proper molting, which is imperative as this species grows.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Blood Red Fire Shrimp are scavengers and will eat any leftover meaty foods that settle on the reef or aquarium bottom. Their diet should be supplemented with freeze-dried, live or frozen meaty foods or flake foods. 

Depending on the particular aquarium the amount of supplemental food necessary will vary, when feeding the fish it is best to keep an eye on the Blood Red Fire Shrimp to guage how much leftovers it is receiving.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

Chaetomorpha sp. is a form of macroalgae that typically grows in long strands that ball up in clumps, where the clump then grows in size as the algae absorbs light and nutrients from the water column. Chaetomorpha Algae has become a favorite amongst reef aquarium keepers for its ability to absorb excess nutrients from the water column and ease of care. 

Chaetomorpha Algae can be placed in sumps or refugiums with moderate water flow and plenty of lighting, here they will absorb phosphates and nitrates from the water column as they continue to grow, then portions of the plant can be harvested or removed from the sump, which will effectively export the excess nutrients they absorbed while growing from the aquarium. 

Its low cost, ease of care and widespread availability has made Chaetomorpha Algae the macroalgae filtration of choice for many marine aquarium hobbyists.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Beyond its nutrient filtering capability, Chaetomorpha Algae grown in the refugium also provides habitat for a wide variety of beneficial organisms like copepods, amphipods, worms and mini starfish. 

Another added benefit of Chaetomorpha Algae over many similar macroalgae is that it does not go through a sexual period like Caulerpa where nutrients are released back into the aquarium water. Utilizing Chaetomorpha Algae for nutrient removal, along with live rock and live sand for de-nitrification and a protein skimming makes for an excellent combination of filtration for marine reef or FOWLR aquariums.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Growth and Feeding[/b][/color]

While Chaetomorpha Algae is easy to grow in most conditions, it will be much more efficient at nutrient export if provided ideal conditions. Ideally Chaetomorpha Algae should be grown in the sump or refugium where it will have low water currents and can be provided plenty of light. 

While Chaetomorpha Algae can survive in lower lighting conditions, it should be provided 75 to 100 watts of 5100K to 6700K floodlight lighting or equivalent fluorescent lighting to thrive. It is important to promote a good growth rate, as the harvested Chaetomorpha Algae is what removes the nutrients from the aquarium ecosystem. 

Faster algae growth will allow for more frequent harvesting, which will in turn increase the filtration benefit of the Chaetomorpha Algae.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

Found in the Western Pacific Ocean: Maldives, Sri Lanka, Great Barrier Reef inhabiting heavy coral growths at a wide range of depths between 30 to 100 feet, the Eibl&#039;s Angelfish makes an interesting addition to any heavily aquascaped or reef aquarium. Eibl&#039;s Angelfish can be kept without too many problems in a reef aquariums, however it is more likely to pick on corals and clams than the Coral Beauty or Flame Angel. The Eibl&#039;s Angelfish is recommended for the intermediate to advanced reef aquarist due to it&#039;s need of excellent water conditions and somewhat diverse dietary needs. 

It can be kept with a wide variety of other fishes, with the exception of other pigmy angelfish (unless in a large aquarium 90 gallons plus) or large predators. If you plan to house it with other pygmy angels it is best to add them together to help avoid territorial disputes. It is possible to keep Eibl&#039;s Angelfish in harems of 3-7 individuals, assuming there is adequate space in the aquarium.

The body is a white to greyish cream color with verticle brown/gold stripes, while the tail section is a dark black with a blue accent stripe on the tail fins. There are also yellow to orange highlights above the eye and on the caudual and dorsal fins. Overall the Eibl&#039;s Angelfish has an intricate beauty that while not as immediately flashy as some other species, it&#039;s sharp lines and contrasting colors make it a beautiful species to have.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Like most species and especially pygmy angelfish the Eibl&#039;s Angelfish is territorial towards both other Eibl&#039;s Angelfish and other pygmy angelfish. Extensive rock work, live rock or reef area is required to give the Eibl&#039;s a suitable environment in the aquarium. The Eibl&#039;s will spend most of it&#039;s time swimming in and out of the rock work picking at marine algaes and small coral polyps. 

While the Eibl&#039;s Angelfish is not overly destructive to a reef aquarium, it should be kept with caution as it can nip at corals and polyps and may be damaging to some species of corals. The Eibl&#039;s can easily be kept with other invertebrates such as shrimps &amp; crabs. It is possible in a large aquarium to keep a school of Eibl&#039;s Angels 3-7 members, when kept in these numbers they will form a harem in which one member will remain a male while the other members will be female (it is possible for this species to morph sexually).

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The diet of the Eibl&#039;s Angel should include marine algae, spirulina, high-quality angelfish preparations, and other meaty items such as brine or krill. This species should be fed two to three times daily what the fish will consume within a minute or two. Being an omnivore it is important to provide a balanced diet of algaes and meats to provide all the necessary vitamins and nutritional needs.

It is possible to keep Eibl's Angelfish in harems of 3-7 individuals, assuming there is adequate space in the aquarium.

The body is a white to greyish cream color with verticle brown/gold stripes, while the tail section is a dark black with a blue accent stripe on the tail fins. There are also yellow to orange highlights above the eye and on the caudual and dorsal fins. Overall the Eibl's Angelfish has an intricate beauty that while not as immediately flashy as some other species, it's sharp lines and contrasting colors make it a beautiful species to have.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Like most species and especially pygmy angelfish the Eibl's Angelfish is territorial towards both other Eibl's Angelfish and other pygmy angelfish. Extensive rock work, live rock or reef area is required to give the Eibl's a suitable environment in the aquarium. The Eibl's will spend most of it's time swimming in and out of the rock work picking at marine algaes and small coral polyps. 

While the Eibl's Angelfish is not overly destructive to a reef aquarium, it should be kept with caution as it can nip at corals and polyps and may be damaging to some species of corals. The Eibl's can easily be kept with other invertebrates such as shrimps & crabs. It is possible in a large aquarium to keep a school of Eibl's Angels 3-7 members, when kept in these numbers they will form a harem in which one member will remain a male while the other members will be female (it is possible for this species to morph sexually).

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding & Nutrition[/b][/color]

The diet of the Eibl's Angel should include marine algae, spirulina, high-quality angelfish preparations, and other meaty items such as brine or krill. This species should be fed two to three times daily what the fish will consume within a minute or two. Being an omnivore it is important to provide a balanced diet of algaes and meats to provide all the necessary vitamins and nutritional needs.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Like most fish found in the aquarium hobby the Bala Shark goes by a variety of common names including: Tri-Color Shark, Silver Shark and of course the Bala Shark named after its scientific name.  Despite their large adult size, Bala Shark are most commonly kept in standard community aquariums where they will happily coexist with a variety of other community fish species.  

While not aggressive, they can be a problem if kept with very small fish species or if not given enough room to swim, as they are active swimmers.  Adult specimens are also kept with larger, semi-aggressive fish species as they are usually able to hold their own once they have reached adult sizes of 1 foot or more.  

They make a great addition to medium to large aquariums where a small group of them can be kept successfully, swimming about all day providing a lot of activity within the aquarium and providing a bright silver color contrast to other less metallic fish species.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Despite their large adult size, Bala Sharks like to swim in schools both in a natural setting and within an aquarium environment, thus it is best to keep them in small groups of 3 to 6 specimens.  It is important to keep in mind that as adults they can reach approximately 1 1/2 feet in length, so they should only be kept in large to very large aquariums.  Will not particularly aggressive, Bala Sharks can pose a hazard to much smaller fish species like Neon Tetras, as they have been known to eat small fish.  

Bala Sharks prefer aquarium setups that have a good mixture of open swimming areas and dense vegetation or vertically oriented drift wood.  An ideal setup for this species would contain lots of live plants, driftwood and open areas to swim, with a low to moderate current and tank mates that will tolerate the Bala Sharks active nature.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Bala Sharks are omnivores and thus will eat a wide variety of plant based or meaty food preparations.  On top of being an omnivore, Bala Sharks are simply just not picky eaters as they will readily consume a wide variety of foodstuffs including: flaked foods, freeze-dried, vegetable or plant matter, frozen foods, bloodworms, tubifex worms and much more.  It is best to feed them a 2 to 3 times per day amounts that they will consume within a minute or two.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The Black Veil Angel hails from the warm temperate waters of the Amazon basin in South America, where it is found in calm waterways and flood plains. Black Veil Angels are found living in areas with dense plants and tree roots, which they use for protection against larger fish species and as a place to hunt insect larvae and other foodstuffs. These days this species is more commonly tank bred in the United States and parts of Southern Asia, than collected from the wild. 

They have long been sought after in the aquarium hobby because of their brilliant black body coloration and long flowing fins. Their long fins mean that they should not be kept with fish species that will nip or tear their fins. Many &quot;fin nipping&quot; species can be kept easily with angelfish as long as the &quot;fin nippers&quot; are kept in groups of 4 or more, so that they will nip at each other and ignore the angelfish. In a small or medium sized aquarium the Black Veil Angel is best kept in a mated pair, in larger aquariums they can be kept in groups of 6 or more individuals.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Black Veil Angelfish will do well in aquariums that are 30 gallons or larger and have plenty of plants and/or driftwood. As a group freshwater Angelfish are territorial and will squabble with one another until a dominant male is established. They can be kept singularly, in mated pairs or in medium sized groups of 6 or more. Contrary to popular belief, long finned species like the Black Veil Angelfish can be kept with barbs and other &quot;fin nipping&quot; species. 

The key here is that the barbs be kept in proper sized groups, so that they nip at each other instead of nipping at the Angelfish or other species that are not equipped for this type of behavior. Barbs prefer to be kept in groups and their nipping at each other is normal behavior that will not hurt them at all; however, this behavior is too boisterous for many other fish species and damaging to long finned fish species. 

Angelfish in general require fairly constant water parameters and are less forgiving than many other freshwater community species towards fluctuations in pH or temperature. Like with most South American Cichlid species, the Black Veil Angelfish prefers soft, slightly acidic water with temperatures that stay between 79 and 83 degrees.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Black Veil Angelfish is an omnivore and should be fed a variety of foods including vegetables as well as meaty foods. Feed a quality flake food as well as live and frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms and tubfex worms. They are particularly fond of bloodworms and it is even believed that feeding Angelfish bloodworms will help stimulate breeding behavior.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The male Betta is one of those iconic fish species that is easily recognized to both aquarium hobbyists and non-hobbyists alike.  Their bright coloration, long flowing fins and unique appearance have made them very popular for decades and arguably one of the most popular fish species among aquarium hobbyists.  Bettas originate from shallow waterways, flood plains, rice paddies and streams in many parts of Southeast Asia including: Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and parts of southern China.  

Since Bettas come from shallow water environments, most hobbyists assume that they can stand low water quality and quick changes in environment.  However, the part of the world that Bettas come from has very consistent warm tropical weather and plenty of rainfall to dilute even shallow water and keep the water quality high and temperature stable.  Thus Bettas need an environment with warm water temperatures (75-86Â° F) and fairly stable water conditions.  

Although Bettas are often sold in small bowls in fish stores, for best care, Bettas should be kept singularly in aquariums of at least 1 gallon, with plenty of vegetation to provide them a vegetarian food source and places to hide when they feel threatened.  Bettas are often referred to as Fighting Fish or &quot;Siamese&quot; Fighting Fish, since it has been bred over the years to be both colorful and combative, especially towards other males. As such, only one male Betta should be kept in an aquarium.  The Betta should be housed with peaceful fish that will not nip at the Bettas long flowing fins.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

While Bettas can do well in waters low in dissolved oxygen, that does not mean they require less oxygen than other fish. Bettas have a special respiratory organ that allows them to breath air directly from the surface. In fact they inherently must do so. In experiments where the labyrinth organ was removed, the fish died from suffocation even though the water was saturated with oxygen. For this reason, Bettas must have access to the water surface to breath air directly from the atmosphere.  

Optimal water for keeping healthy Bettas should be soft, warm, with a neutral to slightly acidic pH.  To mimic their natural environment, water movement should be low, or in the case of a larger aquarium, they should be provided calm areas within the tank including calm areas near the surface of the water.  Bettas may be kept in a community tank as long as their water conditions are met, and no aggressive or fin-nipping fish are present.  

However, only one male may be kept in each aquarium, unless they are separated by a barrier.  Bettas will appreciate aquariums with plenty of live plants or synthetic plants made from plastic or silk to provide them a more natural habitat.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

In nature Bettas subsist almost exclusively on eating insects and insect larvae, which is why they have an upturned mouth that is well suited to snatching their insect prey that might fall into the water. Internally their digestive system is geared for meat, having a much shorter alimentary track than vegetarian fish. 

For this reason, live foods are the ideal diet for the Betta, however they will adapt to eating flake foods and frozen and freeze dried foods including: brine shrimp, daphnia, plankton, tubifex, glassworms, and beef heart, are all excellent options that may be found frozen or freeze dried. If flake food is fed, it should be supplemented with frozen and freeze-dried foods, and if possible live foods.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Bettas can be successfully bred by average aquarists using small aquariums of about 10 gallons in size.  Young Betta of approximately 1 years or less in age are ideal for breeding as their fertility and willingness to breed decrease with age.  Typically Betta sold in pets stores are around 6 months in age, so they should be bred within 6 months of purchase.  

Ideally the Betta should be conditioned prior to breeding, by feeding them a diet of live foods, and they should be kept in water with a pH of about 7.0, and temperature around 80 or slightly above.  When he is ready to breed the male will build a bubble nest at the waters surface, where the deposited eggs will be kept until the hatch.  

The female should be provided with a hiding place, as males may become aggressive during courtship. Even with a hiding place, it is common for the female to lose a few scales or have their fins frayed during spawning.

When they are ready to spawn, the pair will display intense coloration and begin circling each other under the bubble nest. The male will wrap himself around the female who has turned on her back. As the female expels the eggs, they are fertilized and begin to sink, at which time the male will scoop up the eggs and spit them into the bubble nest.  

It is best to remove the female after breeding has taken place, as the male will tend to the young and may become aggressive towards the female.  After the young have hatched they will feed off of their yolk sacks for about 36 hours.  The adult male Betta should be removed within 2 days of the young hatching so that they do not eat any of the newly hatched fry. 

The fry should be fed a couple of feedings daily of baby brine shrimp or very fine baby food. Take care not to overfeed, as the uneaten food will foul the water and can quickly prove lethal to the fry.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The male Betta is one of those iconic fish species that is easily recognized to both aquarium hobbyists and non-hobbyists alike.  Their bright coloration, long flowing fins and unique appearance have made them very popular for decades and arguably one of the most popular fish species among aquarium hobbyists.  Bettas originate from shallow waterways, flood plains, rice paddies and streams in many parts of Southeast Asia including: Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and parts of southern China.  

Since Bettas come from shallow water environments, most hobbyists assume that they can stand low water quality and quick changes in environment.  However, the part of the world that Bettas come from has very consistent warm tropical weather and plenty of rainfall to dilute even shallow water and keep the water quality high and temperature stable.  Thus Bettas need an environment with warm water temperatures (75-86Â° F) and fairly stable water conditions.  

Although Bettas are often sold in small bowls in fish stores, for best care, Bettas should be kept singularly in aquariums of at least 1 gallon, with plenty of vegetation to provide them a vegetarian food source and places to hide when they feel threatened.  Bettas are often referred to as Fighting Fish or "Siamese" Fighting Fish, since it has been bred over the years to be both colorful and combative, especially towards other males. As such, only one male Betta should be kept in an aquarium.  The Betta should be housed with peaceful fish that will not nip at the Bettas long flowing fins.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

While Bettas can do well in waters low in dissolved oxygen, that does not mean they require less oxygen than other fish. Bettas have a special respiratory organ that allows them to breath air directly from the surface. In fact they inherently must do so. In experiments where the labyrinth organ was removed, the fish died from suffocation even though the water was saturated with oxygen. For this reason, Bettas must have access to the water surface to breath air directly from the atmosphere.  

Optimal water for keeping healthy Bettas should be soft, warm, with a neutral to slightly acidic pH.  To mimic their natural environment, water movement should be low, or in the case of a larger aquarium, they should be provided calm areas within the tank including calm areas near the surface of the water.  Bettas may be kept in a community tank as long as their water conditions are met, and no aggressive or fin-nipping fish are present.  

However, only one male may be kept in each aquarium, unless they are separated by a barrier.  Bettas will appreciate aquariums with plenty of live plants or synthetic plants made from plastic or silk to provide them a more natural habitat.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding & Nutrition[/b][/color]

In nature Bettas subsist almost exclusively on eating insects and insect larvae, which is why they have an upturned mouth that is well suited to snatching their insect prey that might fall into the water. Internally their digestive system is geared for meat, having a much shorter alimentary track than vegetarian fish. 

For this reason, live foods are the ideal diet for the Betta, however they will adapt to eating flake foods and frozen and freeze dried foods including: brine shrimp, daphnia, plankton, tubifex, glassworms, and beef heart, are all excellent options that may be found frozen or freeze dried. If flake food is fed, it should be supplemented with frozen and freeze-dried foods, and if possible live foods.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Bettas can be successfully bred by average aquarists using small aquariums of about 10 gallons in size.  Young Betta of approximately 1 years or less in age are ideal for breeding as their fertility and willingness to breed decrease with age.  Typically Betta sold in pets stores are around 6 months in age, so they should be bred within 6 months of purchase.  

Ideally the Betta should be conditioned prior to breeding, by feeding them a diet of live foods, and they should be kept in water with a pH of about 7.0, and temperature around 80 or slightly above.  When he is ready to breed the male will build a bubble nest at the waters surface, where the deposited eggs will be kept until the hatch.  

The female should be provided with a hiding place, as males may become aggressive during courtship. Even with a hiding place, it is common for the female to lose a few scales or have their fins frayed during spawning.

When they are ready to spawn, the pair will display intense coloration and begin circling each other under the bubble nest. The male will wrap himself around the female who has turned on her back. As the female expels the eggs, they are fertilized and begin to sink, at which time the male will scoop up the eggs and spit them into the bubble nest.  

It is best to remove the female after breeding has taken place, as the male will tend to the young and may become aggressive towards the female.  After the young have hatched they will feed off of their yolk sacks for about 36 hours.  The adult male Betta should be removed within 2 days of the young hatching so that they do not eat any of the newly hatched fry. 

The fry should be fed a couple of feedings daily of baby brine shrimp or very fine baby food. Take care not to overfeed, as the uneaten food will foul the water and can quickly prove lethal to the fry.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Gold Dojo Loaches originate from Southeast Asia, where they can be found in a variety of waterways ranging from tropical rivers to lakes and ponds.  As with all loaches, the Gold Dojo Loach is a bottom dwelling species that spends much of its time foraging along the bottom for food.  Since the lower regions of most lakes, ponds and rivers have low lighting conditions, the Gold Dojo Loach utilizes barbells located around its mouth to find food along the bottom and among plant roots, rocky crevices and caves.  

While they are a carnivorous species, they are generally considered scavengers and will not prey on other aquarium inhabitants with very small shrimps being the only exception.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Gold Dojo Loaches use their narrow long body and barbells to get into tight places in the substrate, underneath the edges of rocks and among plant roots to locate and eat all types of meaty foods that make it to the bottom of the aquarium.  They are sought after within the aquarium hobby for their unique appearance and beneficial scavenging, that helps keep the aquarium free of decaying foodstuffs.  

Gold Dojo Loaches are a very peaceful species that can be safely kept in community aquariums and planted aquariums.  They prefer slightly cooler water temperatures ranging from around 68Â° F to 78Â° F, which is most likely due to the fact that in the wild they live far from the water surface where temperatures are cooler.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Gold Dojo Loaches are a carnivorous species that prefers meaty foods like freeze-dried bloodworms and tubifex worms; as well as, frozen and live meaty foods of all types.  Sinking shrimp pellets or other meaty pellets can also be fed as they will sink to the bottom of the aquarium where the Gold Dojo Loach looks for food.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

In 2006 the freshwater aquarium hobby was introduced to a beautiful new species of Danio discovered in the ponds and calm waterways of the Salween basin in Burma or modern day Myanmar.  The Celestial Pearl Danio or Galaxy Danio was an immediate hit with aquarists as its brilliant coloration, ease of care and suitability for community or planted aquariums made it an overnight success.  

The coloration of the Celestial Pearl Danio simply cannot be ignored with their light blue body and gold spots, transparent fins with red and black stripes and gold underbelly is simply a beautiful sight, which is even more impressive in schools of 6 to 10 individuals.  Unfortunately their success in the aquarium hobby has put a serious strain on their wild populations as they live in a relatively small area and are being collected for the aquarium hobby faster than they can comfortably re-populate their numbers.  

Fortunately the Celestial Pearl Danio has been successfully bred within the aquarium hobby and many distributors are working on breeding programs to reduce or eliminate the pressure on this species in the wild.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

In the aquarium environment, the Celestial Pearl Danio is an ideal species for any planted or community aquarium as it brings an abundance of color and will get along with other community species well.  Another plus for this species is that they are quite easy to care for as they will tolerate a variety of water temperatures and conditions, although they would prefer a water temperature around 78Â° F with a slightly alkaline pH.  

Celestial Pearl Danio are a small schooling species that should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals with 8 or 10 individuals in the group being ideal.  It is best to replicate a fish species natural environment within the aquarium, and for this species that means having an abundance of vegetation (preferably live plants) with some drift wood and rocks.  

In the wild this species lives in very calm water that is often spring fed or formed from overflows of other waterways, thus they should be kept in aquariums that do not have constant strong direct currents.  Celestial Pearl Danio live in shallow water in the wild that has strong direct sunlight, so they do very well in strongly lit planted aquariums, and will use heavily planted areas in the aquarium or driftwood and rocks to retreat to if they feel threatened.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Celestial Pearl Danio is an omnivore that will eat virtually any standard topical fish foods available within the hobby.  They will readily accept flaked foods, frozen preparations, vegetable or algae flakes and wafers along with freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex worms and brine shrimp.  Essentially they will eat the same foods that would be being fed to the bulk of tropical freshwater species found in a tropical community aquarium.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The Pictus cat is a most popular member of the large Pimelodidae family of catfish that originate from the warm waters throughout South America.  They have been present within the aquarium hobby for decades and proven themselves to build both a very interesting species to keep, but one that does very well within the aquarium environment.  

They have become quite popular due to their bright silver coloration on their bodies combined with black spots and reticulations on their head, body and fins.  Pictus Cats are best kept in small groups of 3 or more specimens in large soft water community aquariums with medium to large sized tank mates or with in New World Cichlid aquariums.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Pictus Cats are considered a community species, as they are very peaceful towards other fish species as long as they are not too small in size (Ex. Neon Tetra).  While the Pictus Cat will not show aggression towards other fish species, it will eat very small fishes like the Neon Tetra.  Pictus Cats are active at night scavenging for food on or near the substrate and will readily consume very small fishes like Neon Tetra while they sleep. Therefore it is important to consider the adult size of 10&quot; and keep this species with other suitably sized fish species.  

Pictus Cats are also very active swimmers that should be provided plenty of swimming room within the aquarium, along with some shaded areas like plants, driftwood or rock caves in which to escape the bright aquarium lighting.  The ideal setup for the Pictus Cat would be a heavily planted soft water aquarium with filtered light creating shaded areas of the aquarium, along with natural caves formed by driftwood or rocks.  

In the wild they prefer to stay in small groups and would due very well in an aquarium of 125 gallons or more in size that could support a small group of 3 or 4 specimens.  Pictus Cats also prefer a sandy substrate and moderate water currents that closely simulate their natural living conditions in forest covered streams throughout South America.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Like most tropical catfish species, the Pictus Catfish is not a picky eater and will readily consume a wide variety of meaty foods.  They will forage about the lower areas of the aquarium looking for any foodstuffs that have made their way to the aquarium substrate.  

Pictus Cats will also feed directly from the water column on a variety of foodstuffs including flake, frozen, pellets and small live foods.  While they make good scavengers, the Pictus Cat should also be fed some sinking pellet type foods to make sure that they receive a complete nutritional diet.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Pictus Catfish are an egg-laying species in which under suitable conditions the female will lay eggs that are then fertilized by the male.  Breeders have found that obtaining the correct environment and conditions to induce breeding in the Pictus Catfish has been very difficult to reproduce, thus this species is considered very difficult to breed in an aquarium setting.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Redtail Sharks have beautiful jet black bodies with vibrant red tail fins.  They are a medium sized tropical community species that is considered semi-aggressive with kept in a medium to large community aquarium, but can often be more aggressive if kept in too small of an aquarium with similarly sized and shaped tank mates.  However, when this species is kept in 55 gallon or larger aquarium with plenty of plants, driftwood and rock-work, it can be an excellent long-lived tank mate. 

In the wild this species live in tropical waterways in and near Thailand where it is used to an environment with an abundance of plants and tree roots.  It is best to emulate their natural habitat as best as possible in the aquarium, as this will help the Redtail Shark feel more at home in the aquarium and allow it to establish a suitable territory within the aquarium.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Redtail Sharks are known as much for their territorial aquarium behavior as their striking coloration and pleasing shark-like body shape.  However, this should not keep a moderately experienced aquarium keeper from keeping the Redtail Shark in a medium to large community aquarium environment.  This species will often claim large territories within the aquarium and will become quite aggressive towards other of its own kind or similarly shaped species like Rainbow Sharks.  

This aggressive nature can be mitigated by providing multiple areas in the aquarium that contain substantial driftwood, plants and rock formations to create various territories within the aquarium.  Medium to Large community aquariums of 90 gallons or more that contain plenty of driftwood, plants and rock formations should be able to support Redtail Sharks and similarly sized and shaped specimens provided the aquarium has lots of aqua-scaping. 

Larger aquariums of 125 gallons or more that are heavily aqua-scaped with plants, driftwood and rock formations can easily support Redtail Sharks with other similar species like Rainbow Sharks.  Redtail Sharks do very well with boisterous species like barbs, tetra and rainbowfish and will generally not bother smaller fish species as long as they are in a suitable aquarium setup.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Redtail Sharks are very easy to feed as they will readily consume a large variety of meaty and plant-based foodstuffs.  They will take food from the waters surface, the water column and even food resting on the aquarium substrate.  It is best to feed this species a varied diet that contains a combination of meaty and vegetable flake and pellet foods, freeze-dried bloodworms and tubifex worms and even vegetable based pellets and wafers.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The Harlequin Rasbora is one of the more popular species of Rasbora found within the aquarium hobby.  They are highly desirable additions to freshwater community aquariums as a group of Harlequin&#039;s have beautiful coloration and markings with a very docile disposition that makes them perfect tank mates for other small or medium sized community species.  

Harlequin&#039;s are easily recognizable due to their rich reddish-copper body and the distinctive black wedge marking on the rear half of their body.  In the wild they will always be found in good sized schools, thus they should also be kept in groups within the aquarium environment as well.  Keeping a group of 8 or more Harlequin Rasbora will make them feel much more safe and comfortable within the aquarium and will show off their markings as the group will have a much more striking appearance than a single individual.  

In the wild Harlequin Rasbora are found living in tropical lowland waterways throughout southeastern Asia.  Their natural habitat is very heavily populated with dense vegetation and maintains tropical temperatures of 73 to 79 F (22 -26 C) throughout the year.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Like most Rasbora species, Harlequin Rasbora are considered an easy species to keep within a community aquarium.  They will do best in setups that resemble their natural habitat and that have consistent water parameters.  Harlequins should be kept in schools of 8 or more individuals in aquariums that have plenty of plants and driftwood along with stable water conditions that include temperatures in the mid to upper 70&#039;s and pH in the range of 6.0 to 6.5.  

They should also be kept with other similarly sized peaceful fish species or with docile medium sized fish species.  If they are kept with more boisterous species like barbs, sharks or angelfish, it is best to provide them a habitat with plenty of plants so that they can retreat to safer areas of the aquarium when they feel threatened or if picked on.  Harlequins themselves will not nip at or bother other fish or invertebrate species and are considered good tank mates for even the most sensitive fish species.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Harlequin Rasbora are very easy to feed as they will readily consume a wide variety of meaty and vegetable based foods.  They will do well with a varied diet consisting of flake foods, small pellets, freeze-dried bloodworms or tubifex worms and other similar preparations.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Harlequin Rasboras are generally considered difficult to breed, but have been breed by advanced aquarists and some professional breeders.  Their willingness to breed is very dependent on their environment and the age of the breeding specimens.  They should be housed in an aquarium with plenty of broad leafed plants with a stable water temperature between 76 and 79 degrees F, along with an acidic soft water with a pH of 6.0 to 6.3.  Within these conditions the aquarist should introduce a small group of 2 or 3 young females (9 to 12 months of age) along with a more mature male (approx. 2 years of age).  

The newly introduced breeding group should be fed live foods while in the breeding aquarium.  Breeding typically takes place in the early morning hours and consists of the male of the species trembling near or rubbing up against the females in order to try and induce them to spawn.  If interested the female will rub her underside against the underside of a broad leaf and encourage the male to join her there to fertilize the eggs.  

The fertilized eggs will adhere to the bottom of the leaf where they will stay until they hatch in about 24 hours.  After the eggs are laid, the parents should be removed from the aquarium and the lights should be kept dim until 24 to 48 hours after the eggs have hatched.  

Like all small fry, the babies should be kept with a small bubble filter that will oxygenate and keep the water filtered, while also keeping the water from stagnating.  The babies should be fed small foods like infusoria and then gradually moved to larger foodstuffs over the course o the next 6 to 8 weeks.

The Harlequin Rasbora is one of the more popular species of Rasbora found within the aquarium hobby.  They are highly desirable additions to freshwater community aquariums as a group of Harlequin's have beautiful coloration and markings with a very docile disposition that makes them perfect tank mates for other small or medium sized community species.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Emerald Green Cory Cats bring beauty, interest and functionality to the lower areas of the community aquarium, as they work to scavenge excess foodstuffs and decaying plant matter from the aquarium substrate.  Their efficiency at keeping the substrate clean along with their unique swimming style and attractive looks have made them a popular community species for decades.  

In the wild Emerald Green Cory Cats are found throughout tributaries and flood plains in and around the Amazon river and nearby areas of South America. They are normally found moving along the bottom of the river among the roots and plants savaging for a variety of foods.  Emerald Green Cats are also a very peaceful species that can be kept with any variety of other peaceful freshwater community fish.

As is the case with all species in the genus, Cory Cats will regularly swim quickly to the surface for a gulp of air. The fish swallows the air, which blood vessels in the hind gut extract oxygen from; it is then expelled through the vent the next time the fish breaks the surface for another gulp of air. This adaptation is believed to have evolved so that the fish can survive in poorly-oxygenated water such as stagnant pools during the dry season. It is however essential to the fish&#039;s well-being that it regularly swallows air.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Emerald Green Cory Cats should be kept in aquariums that contain ample vegetation, driftwood or root structures, so that the Emerald Green Cory Cat can retreat from the bright aquarium lights when it feels the need. The Emerald Green Cory Cat will search the aquarium substrate for most of its food, but usually will require supplemental feeding via sinking wafers or pellets if not enough excess food is present in the aquarium substrate. 

This species can be kept singularly or in groups of any size, and in the case where they are kept in large enough groups it is not uncommon for specimens to pair off and even mate within a suitably aquascaped aquarium.  While they can be kept singularly, they are a social species that does live in groups in the wild and will be better off in the long term if they are kept in a small group within the aquarium as well.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

In the aquarium environment Emerald Green Cats will readily accept a variety of meaty and vegetable matter foodstuffs including: flake, freeze-dried, frozen, live foods and pellets. This species is an excellent scavenger that will work to keep the aquarium substrate clean of excess foodstuffs and some decaying plant matter.  While this species is an excellent scavenger, supplemental foods such as bloodworms, tubifex, flake food, or sinking carnivore pellets should be offered to ensure proper nutrition.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Butterfly Peacock Bass or Ocellaris Peacock Bass (Cichla ocellaris) are native to the rivers and tributaries of northern South America in Colombia, Venezuela, Guianas &amp; Brazil. They have also been introduced to areas outside of their native habitat including: Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Singapore. 

Key characteristics to look for to possitively ID Cichla ocellaris include: 3 faint transversal bars, a round mark underneath the pectoral fin, sometimes a single distinct individualized ocellum unerneath the second dorsal fin and no black markings on the operculum (cheek).  

Being the most temperature tolerant species of Peacock Bass has made the Butterfly Peacock Bass (Cichla ocellaris) both one of the more popular aquarium species and also the most commonly transplanted species. Butterfly Peacock Bass are similar in size to Monoculus Peacock Bass, with adults typically reaching about 24 to 28 inches in length.

Butterfly Peacock Bass are ambush hunters who prefer slightly calmer waters where they can find cover near plants, drift wood or rocky formations to lay in wait for prey items. The waters of their native rivers are very warm year round with temperatures reaching upwards of 86Â° when the sun is at its peak, and with nighttime temperatures still hovering around the 78Â° to 80Â° mark. 

The water conditions of their natural habitat are acidic with a pH range of 5.0 to 6.5 and a water hardness between 5 to 15 dH; as well as, moderate flow and a large volume of water passing down river daily. Cichla have evolved perfectly for their environment with color patterns enabling them to blend into their environment, long sleek bodies and powerful pectoral and anal fins, which they use to maintain ambush positions in flowing river waters and ambush prey. 

Butterfly Peacock Bass are becoming much more available within the aquarium hobby as their size, pattern, coloration and aggressive feeding habits have made them very popular with aquarium hobbyists interested in keeping larger New World Cichlid species. As the popularity of Peacock Bass has grown within the aquarium hobby, breeders have been busy with propagating Cichla to fill the demand. Unfortunately most breeders do not attempt to maintain the pureness of each species and instead cross breed multiple species of Peacock Bass which has led to an abundance of hybrids being sold to aquarium hobbyists.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

When keeping Butterfly Peacock Bass in an aquarium environment, it is important to account for their large size, feeding habits and aggressive nature. Ocellaris Peacock Bass come from river ways that have a constant flow of fresh water which keeps oxygen levels high and nutrient levels low. 

Peacock Bass have become accustomed to an environment with high quality water with low levels of pollutants and high levels of oxygen. Peacock Bass aquariums need to replicate this environment through strong mechanical, chemical and biological filtration along with medium water movement. 

Peacock Bass are large fish that eat equally large meals, thus excellent filtration is required to remove the excess food and waste products produced from such a large species. The adult size of the Butterfly Peacock Bass is also an important factor in choosing the right aquarium to house them, with the size and shape of the aquarium being very important. 

Adults sizes range from around 24 to 28 inches in length, thus it is important to provide an aquarium that is long enough and wide enough from front to back to allow the Peacock Bass to swim and turn around comfortably. An aquarium of 6 to 8 feet in length and 3 feet from front to back should be considered as minimum aquarium size for an adult specimen, while smaller specimens can be raised in smaller aquariums if they are moved to larger tanks as they grow. 

The aquarium decor should be designed to provide plenty of swimming room, while also providing some areas of cover using driftwood, floating or well rooted plants and rocks with a sandy or gravel substrate.

Tank mates are an important consideration when housing adult Peacock Bass with other New World Cichlids due to their large size and aggressive temperament. A good rule of thumb is that anything that can fit in the mouth of the Peacock Bass eventually will. Tank mates should consist of other large aggressive New World Cichlids, large Catfish species and freshwater rays. 

Butterfly Peacock Bass can be kept as the only Peacock Bass species or mixed with other species of Peacock Bass. They also do well in good sized groups and will work out a dominance structure amongst themselves, which will lower aggression between fish once their social hierarchy is in place.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Wild Peacock Bass feed on a wide variety of live foods living in their river ecosystem, which include: insects, smaller fish, worms, crustaceans and amphibians. Butterfly Peacock Bass kept within the aquarium environment will readily feed on the same variety of live foods that they feed on in nature, but it is often more desirable to ween them off of live foods.

Live foods are typically more expensive, require holding facilities, more frequent trips to the aquarium store, can bring diseases and can create excess pollution in the aquarium water. Hobbyists generally ween their Peacock Bass to commercial food preparations in order to simplify their care and avoid the pitfalls or live foods. 

However, it is not uncommon for Peacock Bass enthusiasts who have weened their fish to commercial foods to provide the occasional live feeding to enjoy the prey drive and aggressive feeding technique of the Peacock Bass. Suitable commercial foods for Peacock Bass include: blood worms, pellet foods, food sticks, frozen meaty foods like krill, silver sides or similar fare. 

Peacock Bass will also consume a variety of dead meaty foods like raw shrimp, raw fish and other meaty items. Individual specimens will often have their own preferences, with some specimens eating most anything while others will be more picky about their diet.

Unfortunately most breeders do not attempt to maintain the pureness of each species and instead cross breed multiple species of Peacock Bass which has led to an abundance of hybrids being sold to aquarium hobbyists.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

When keeping Butterfly Peacock Bass in an aquarium environment, it is important to account for their large size, feeding habits and aggressive nature. Ocellaris Peacock Bass come from river ways that have a constant flow of fresh water which keeps oxygen levels high and nutrient levels low. 

Peacock Bass have become accustomed to an environment with high quality water with low levels of pollutants and high levels of oxygen. Peacock Bass aquariums need to replicate this environment through strong mechanical, chemical and biological filtration along with medium water movement. 

Peacock Bass are large fish that eat equally large meals, thus excellent filtration is required to remove the excess food and waste products produced from such a large species. The adult size of the Butterfly Peacock Bass is also an important factor in choosing the right aquarium to house them, with the size and shape of the aquarium being very important. 

Adults sizes range from around 24 to 28 inches in length, thus it is important to provide an aquarium that is long enough and wide enough from front to back to allow the Peacock Bass to swim and turn around comfortably. An aquarium of 6 to 8 feet in length and 3 feet from front to back should be considered as minimum aquarium size for an adult specimen, while smaller specimens can be raised in smaller aquariums if they are moved to larger tanks as they grow. 

The aquarium decor should be designed to provide plenty of swimming room, while also providing some areas of cover using driftwood, floating or well rooted plants and rocks with a sandy or gravel substrate.

Tank mates are an important consideration when housing adult Peacock Bass with other New World Cichlids due to their large size and aggressive temperament. A good rule of thumb is that anything that can fit in the mouth of the Peacock Bass eventually will. Tank mates should consist of other large aggressive New World Cichlids, large Catfish species and freshwater rays. 

Butterfly Peacock Bass can be kept as the only Peacock Bass species or mixed with other species of Peacock Bass. They also do well in good sized groups and will work out a dominance structure amongst themselves, which will lower aggression between fish once their social hierarchy is in place.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding & Nutrition[/b][/color]

Wild Peacock Bass feed on a wide variety of live foods living in their river ecosystem, which include: insects, smaller fish, worms, crustaceans and amphibians. Butterfly Peacock Bass kept within the aquarium environment will readily feed on the same variety of live foods that they feed on in nature, but it is often more desirable to ween them off of live foods.

Live foods are typically more expensive, require holding facilities, more frequent trips to the aquarium store, can bring diseases and can create excess pollution in the aquarium water. Hobbyists generally ween their Peacock Bass to commercial food preparations in order to simplify their care and avoid the pitfalls or live foods. 

However, it is not uncommon for Peacock Bass enthusiasts who have weened their fish to commercial foods to provide the occasional live feeding to enjoy the prey drive and aggressive feeding technique of the Peacock Bass. Suitable commercial foods for Peacock Bass include: blood worms, pellet foods, food sticks, frozen meaty foods like krill, silver sides or similar fare. 

Peacock Bass will also consume a variety of dead meaty foods like raw shrimp, raw fish and other meaty items. Individual specimens will often have their own preferences, with some specimens eating most anything while others will be more picky about their diet.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Electric Blue Acara are a product of forced hybridization, which is the process of combing the eggs from a female fish with the sperm of a genetically similar donor male species. Which in the case of Blue Acara is easy to do as they lay eggs that are externally fertilized. In the case of Electric Blue Acara, Asian fish farms were able to fertilize Blue Acara eggs with the sperm from the genetically similar Electric Blue Ram. The resulting fertilized eggs are then hatched and raised in a lab, where the resulting offspring are then line bred in order to stabilize the recessive trait.

Like the Electric Blue Ram, the Electric Blue Acara will breed true with all of the fry exhibiting electric blue coloration. If cross bread with a typical Blue Acara, you will end up with 100% normal Blue Acara who carries a recessive electric gene. This is good for the long term health of the species, as wild Blue Acara can be bred back into the gene pool while still maintaining plenty of electric blue offspring.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Adult Electric Blue Acara will do well in aquariums that are at least 30 gallons, which should ideally have either a fine sandy substrate or small size gravel substrate, contain multiple places where they can find shelter like driftwood, rock structures, or dense vegetation and areas of both diffused and bright lighting. 

Electric Blue Acara will appreciate planted aquariums that simulate their native environment, but have been known to dig some while breeding which can cause some uprooting in plants that are not well established. Electric Blue Acara have become quite popular within a short time due not only to their brilliant coloration, but due to their good temperament and ability to fit in well in a variety of aquarium environments. 

They can peacefully coexist with all but the smallest most shy fish or largest most aggressive fish, which makes them an excellent addition to most hobbyists aquariums. It should be noted that they will become more aggressive during breeding, thus mated pairs will not be suitable for community aquariums with smaller tank mates. 

Electric Blue Acara may bully or even eat very small fish like Neon Tetra, but can be kept with most all types of community fish larger than 2 inches (5 cm) in length. Overall they are a hardy, colorful, moderately sized, long lived and full of personality community Cichlid species.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Electric Blue Acara is an omnivore and should be fed a variety of foods, such as frozen or freeze-dried brine shrimp, bloodworms, blackworms, flake food, and Cichlid pellets. They also relish live food and should occasionally be provided with live white worms, brine shrimp, or other similar items. Best to feed 2 to 3 times a day an amount of food that they will consume within a few minutes.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Electric Blue Acara are dimorphic, egg layers who practice brood care and renown for being excellent parents to their young fry. To induce breeding and sustain the ideal breeding environment, the water temperature should be raised to and maintained at about 86Â°Â F. 

The female Electric Blue Acara will lay from 150-250 eggs in a carefully cleaned and selected location, which generally consists of a hard surface like a smooth rock, slate, shell or clay pot. The eggs will hatch within 2-3 days and the fry should be swimming around within a week. 

A pair of Electric Blue Acara will continue to breed every few weeks if the fry are constantly removed shortly after they hatch. The newly hatched fry can be fed a diet of baby brine shrimp, crushed flake, crushed pellet or similar fare and then moved to other foods as they mature.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Originally collected from clear water streams throughout Peru, Colombia and Brazil, the Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid (Apistogramma cacatuoides) is now due to its popularity with the aquarium hobby mostly raised in Asian fish farms. Unlike many South American Cichlid species that originate from blackwater, low pH habitats, the Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid originates from small white water and clear water streams and shallow lakes that form during the rainy season. 

Their natural habitat consists of shallow waters that are much more susceptible to both pH and water temperature fluctuations, than the larger rivers and flood plains that many Cichlids come from. This tolerance for a range of pH and water temperature parameters helps to make Apistogramma cacatuoides excellent candidates for aquarium life. However, as with most all tropical fish species, changes in water parameters should occur gradually and not subject the fish to extreme shifts in water conditions.

While Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlids are popular within the hobby due to their ease of care and willingness to adapt to aquarium life, most hobbyists choose to keep them for their unique engaging personalities and brilliant finnage coloration. The popularity of the Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid has led to them being primarily raised in fish farms as opposed to being collected in the wild. 

This was done primarily to supply the demand for the species, but has also led to line-breeding of the fish in order to accentuate the bright red and orange of their dorsal fins. The end result of this is that the Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlids now found within the hobby have much more brightly colored finnage (especially the dorsal fin) than their wild cousins. A displaying male specimen will undoubtedly catch the eye of even the most selective of hobbyist.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Ideally, hobbyists should keep Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlids in environments that are similar to their native habitats and provide the fish with a sense of security. In the case of Apistogramma Cichlids, who live primarily in the lower regions of the aquarium, they will appreciate an aquarium that has a larger footprint or breeder style tank. 

Suitable substrates include sand, gravel or a mix of the two, with areas of rocky caves or crevices, driftwood or wood root and a mix of plants that include some mid-ground to foreground plants like Anubias or Java Fern. Despite most Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid specimens now being farm raised these days, they do come from waters that have dense vegetation and constant flow which keep nutrient levels and nitrate at a minimum. Thus it is best to provide good nutrient export either via live plants, partial water changes or ideally both.

It is this constant water flow and dense vegetation of their native habitat that has shaped the social structure of this species, with dense populations of fish living in a relatively small area. Apistogramma cacatuoides kept in larger groups will coexist well with one other; however, large groups of fish, even 3 inch long fish, require a fairly large aquarium (75 gallons or more) to do well and thrive. 

The benefit to keeping large groups of Dwarf Cichlids is that they will exhibit little to no aggression towards each other, as no single individual will be able to establish its own territory. However, they are more commonly kept in small groups along with other fish species in planted or community aquariums. In this case it is best to keep a single male and a group of females in order to not have aggression problems between a dominant male and the sub-dominant males specimens. This aggression with sub-dominant Apistogramma is similar to the aggression that other Cichlid species exhibit towards one another when kept in small groups.

Water flow and dissolved oxygen are also important factors when keeping Apistogramma Cichlids, as their native river habitats have good amounts of water flow and high levels of dissolved oxygen. Hobbyists will want to have a good amount of water flow within the aquarium, either via a canister filter return, spray bar or a dedicated powerhead positioned to agitate the surface of the water and create higher levels of dissolved oxygen.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid like other Apistogramma Cichlids is carnivore that feed primarily on insects, insect larvae, small crustaceans and small worms in their native environment. They are not picky eaters and will accept a wide variety of foods, but they do best in the aquarium environment when fed a variety of frozen and freeze-dried commercial foods like blood worms, brine shrimp, krill, tubifex worms and other similar meaty items. 

They can also be offered high quality carnivore flakes and mini pellets intended for freshwater carnivores. It is not recommended to feed only flake or pellet foods as this will typically lead to more a more faded coloration and will often lack all the nutrients and minerals required to maintain a healthy immune system. It is best to feed smaller meals 2 to 3 times per day. Apistogramma cacatuoides will also readily consume live foods like small worms, brine shrimp, daphnia and other similar items.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Apistogramma cacatuoides are egg layers, with the female typically finding a suitable rocky cave or crevice in which to deposit her eggs. However, specimens in the aquarium environment will also utilize clay pots and even PVC tubes as a place to deposit their eggs. 

Hobbyists wanting to breed the Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid should either pair up a male specimen with a small group of females or keep a group of males and females together and wait for one of the males to establish dominance over the others, then removing the sub-dominant males in order to avoid them being beaten up or killed.

The aquarium housing the dominant male and his harem of females should contain enough caves or cave like structures so that each female has her own. The cave openings should not face one another, and should be staggered around the aquarium enough to break up the line of sight and give each female some privacy from the others. Ideally other aquarium decor like driftwood and/or plants should be used as well to prevent infighting within the harem.

The male will court the females though a dance like motion during which he will display brilliant coloration and erect, brightly colored finnage. After successfully catching the attention of one of the females, the male will follow the female to her chosen cave where she will lay her eggs on the cave wall or ceiling and the male will fertilize the eggs. In larger aquariums, 40 to 75 gallons males will breed with multiple females; however, in smaller 15 to 20 gallon aquariums it is usually best to remove the other specimens.

The female will guard the fry constantly until they are free swimming juveniles and for several weeks thereafter. She will generally move them about the tank in an effort to sheppard them towards potential food sources like tiny crustaceans and insect larvae. Hobbyists will want to provide meaty items like newly hatched baby brine shrimp, finely crushed flake food or similar items. Java moss, sponge material or similar aquarium decor is an ideal place for young Apistogramma to pick at and graze on tiny foodstuffs.

It is best to feed smaller meals 2 to 3 times per day. Apistogramma cacatuoides will also readily consume live foods like small worms, brine shrimp, daphnia and other similar items.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Apistogramma cacatuoides are egg layers, with the female typically finding a suitable rocky cave or crevice in which to deposit her eggs. However, specimens in the aquarium environment will also utilize clay pots and even PVC tubes as a place to deposit their eggs. 

Hobbyists wanting to breed the Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid should either pair up a male specimen with a small group of females or keep a group of males and females together and wait for one of the males to establish dominance over the others, then removing the sub-dominant males in order to avoid them being beaten up or killed.

The aquarium housing the dominant male and his harem of females should contain enough caves or cave like structures so that each female has her own. The cave openings should not face one another, and should be staggered around the aquarium enough to break up the line of sight and give each female some privacy from the others. Ideally other aquarium decor like driftwood and/or plants should be used as well to prevent infighting within the harem.

The male will court the females though a dance like motion during which he will display brilliant coloration and erect, brightly colored finnage. After successfully catching the attention of one of the females, the male will follow the female to her chosen cave where she will lay her eggs on the cave wall or ceiling and the male will fertilize the eggs. In larger aquariums, 40 to 75 gallons males will breed with multiple females; however, in smaller 15 to 20 gallon aquariums it is usually best to remove the other specimens.

The female will guard the fry constantly until they are free swimming juveniles and for several weeks thereafter. She will generally move them about the tank in an effort to sheppard them towards potential food sources like tiny crustaceans and insect larvae. Hobbyists will want to provide meaty items like newly hatched baby brine shrimp, finely crushed flake food or similar items. Java moss, sponge material or similar aquarium decor is an ideal place for young Apistogramma to pick at and graze on tiny foodstuffs.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Azul Peacock Bass (Cichla piquiti) are native to the rivers and tributaries of northern South America in Colombia, Venezuela, Guianas &amp; Brazil. They have also been introduced to areas outside of their native habitat including: Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Singapore. Key characteristics to look for to positively ID Cichla piquiti include: grayish brown body color, bluish coloration on fins, vertical dark bars throughout the length of the body and yellow dots along with a eye-spot on their tail fin. 

Cichla piquiti are very fast growers, who will grow quickly to about 16 to 18 inches in length and then over time depending on food source, water condition and tank size, reach an eventual adult length of upwards of 29 inches. They are a very fast swimming and boisterous species that will hit prey items (even pellet foods) with amazing force that can startle other tank mates and their human owners alike.

Despite the aggression they show towards their prey, they are not considered to be that aggressive towards other suitably sized tank mates. The reason size is so critical is that tank mates that are not at least half as large as the Azul Peacock Bass will usually be reguarded as prey. So despite not being too aggressive towards tank mates, their shear size and fast, burst ambush style feeding behavior make Azul Peacocks a poor choice to keep with timid fish species, who may find aquarium life with an Azul difficult. 

Azul Peacock Bass are ambush hunters who navigate their native river and tributary waters in search of prey both above and below the waters surface. Their native waters are very warm year round with temperatures reaching upwards of 86Â° when the sun is at its peak, and with nighttime temperatures still hovering around the 76Â° to 80Â° mark. The water conditions of their natural habitat are acidic with a pH range of 5.0 to 6.5 and a water hardness between 5 to 15 dH; as well as, moderate flow and a large volume of water passing down river daily. 

Cichla have evolved perfectly for their environment with color patterns enabling them to blend into their environment, long sleek bodies and powerful pectoral and anal fins, which they use to maintain ambush positions in flowing river waters and ambush prey. 

Azul Peacock Bass are available within the aquarium hobby despite the Brazilian government banning their export from many locations; however, their size, pattern, coloration and aggressive feeding habits have made them highly sought after with aquarium hobbyists interested in keeping larger New World Cichlid species. 

As the popularity of Peacock Bass in general has grown within the aquarium hobby, breeders have been busy with propagating Cichla to fill the demand. Unfortunately most breeders do not attempt to maintain the pureness of each species and instead cross breed multiple species of Peacock Bass which has led to an abundance of hybrids being sold to aquarium hobbyists.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

When keeping Azul Peacock Bass in an aquarium environment, it is important to account for their large size, feeding habits and aggressive nature. Azul Peacock Bass come from river ways that have a constant flow of fresh water which keeps oxygen levels high and nutrient levels low. Peacock Bass have become accustomed to an environment with high quality water with low levels of pollutants and high levels of oxygen. Peacock Bass aquariums need to replicate this environment through strong mechanical, chemical and biological filtration along with medium water movement. 

Peacock Bass are large fish that eat equally large meals, thus excellent filtration is required to remove the excess food and waste products produced from such a large species. The adult size of the Azul Peacock Bass is also an important factor in choosing the right aquarium to house them, with the size and shape of the aquarium being very important. 

Adult sizes range from around 26 to 28 inches in length, thus it is important to provide an aquarium that is long enough and wide enough from front to back to allow the Peacock Bass to swim and turn around comfortably. An aquarium of 6 to 8 feet in length and 3 feet from front to back should be considered as minimum aquarium size for an adult specimen, while smaller specimens can be raised in smaller aquariums if they are moved to larger tanks as they grow. The aquarium decor should be designed to provide plenty of swimming room, while also providing some areas of cover using driftwood, floating or well rooted plants and rocks with a sandy or gravel substrate.

Tank mates are an important consideration when housing adult Peacock Bass with other New World Cichlids due to their large size and aggressive temperament. A good rule of thumb is that anything that can fit in the mouth of the Peacock Bass eventually will. Tank mates should consist of other large aggressive New World Cichlids, large Catfish species and freshwater rays. 

Safe tank mates should be roughly at least half the size of the Azul Peacock Bass to be sure that they will not be seen as a food source. Azul Peacock Bass can be kept as the only Peacock Bass species or mixed with other species of Peacock Bass. When kept in a suitably large aquarium, they will do well in good sized groups and will work out a dominance structure among themselves, which will lower aggression between fish once their social hierarchy is in place.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Wild Peacock Bass feed on a wide variety of live foods living in their river ecosystem, which include: insects, smaller fish, worms, crustaceans and amphibians. Azul Peacock Bass kept within the aquarium environment will readily feed on the same variety of live foods that they feed on in nature, but it is often more desirable to ween them off of live foods. 

Live foods are typically more expensive, require holding facilities, more frequent trips to the aquarium store, can bring diseases and can create excess pollution in the aquarium water. Hobbyists generally ween their Peacock Bass to commercial food preparations in order to simplify their care and avoid the pitfalls or live foods. 

However, it is not uncommon for Peacock Bass enthusiasts who have weened their fish to commercial foods to provide the occasional live feeding to enjoy the prey drive and aggressive feeding technique of the Peacock Bass. Suitable commercial foods for Peacock Bass include: blood worms, pellet foods, food sticks, frozen meaty foods like krill, silver sides or similar fare. 

Peacock Bass will also consume a variety of dead meaty foods like raw shrimp, raw fish and other meaty items. Individual specimens will often have their own preferences, with some specimens eating most anything while others will be more picky about their diet.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The Red Texas Cichlid is a hybrid fish that was developed by the cross breeding of Flowerhorn Cichlid (Cichlasoma sp.) and Texas Cichlid (Herichthys cyanoguttatus), thus does not exist in the wild. In a sense the Red Texas Cichlid is a second generation hybrid, as the Flowerhorn Cichlid with which it is cross bred is already a hybrid produced by cross breeding the Trimac Cichlid with other various Central American Cichlids. As Flowerhorn cross breeding began in the mid 80s, they have since been bred with multiple other species and line bred for coloration and pattern, which has made them almost indistinguishable from their wild origins.

While Flowerhorn Cichlids are well established with various strains of reproducible colors and patterns, the Red Texas Cichlid is in a much earlier stage of its development. Because of this the overall quality of each fish varies widely between individual specimens, which means only a few specimens grow to exhibit the brilliant red and black colorations that are so highly sought after. The rarity of species with the brilliant red show coloration and the scarcity of their availability in the aquarium hobby has meant that their price is often quite expensive and can vary wildly between various aquarium stores.

While high quality show specimens are a rare find, aquarium stores will often have fry or juvenile Red Texas Cichlid which while a gamble, may turn out to be an attractive fish. While most fish will never develop the brilliant full body red coloration, and will instead have a large number of black spots on their body making them more black than red. However, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and many of the red, black and pearl fleck specimens while not show quality turn out to be very attractive and rewarding fish.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Red Texas Cichlid should be housed in a aquarium of at least 75 gallons, with 125 gallons or larger being recommended for multiple specimens. Their environment should have a sand or fine gravel substrate, should contain an adequate amount of rock caves or pieces of driftwood to hide among and use as territory. If live plants are used, make sure they are either secured to driftwood, rock, or planted in pots below the substrate as they will either be shredded or relocated. 

Light intensity is not an issue, although the species prefers to have the option for shade it its disposal. Red Texas Cichlids are hardy in nature, but are messy eaters and can be sensitive to high levels of nitrates; they should be provided with strong and efficient biological, mechanical, and chemical filtration in order to ensure clean water conditions and keep nitrate levels down. When keeping large Cichlids like these, hobbyists will generally need to perform regular water changes even when using a good filtration system.

Aggression is a serious consideration when keeping Red Texas Cichlids as they are considerable more aggressive than other Texas Cichlids (Herichthys cyanoguttatus). When planning tank mates for this species, it is best to think of the Red Texas Cichlid as a Flowerhorn Cichlid rather than as Texas Cichlid. They should only be kept with other large robust semi-aggressive to aggressive fish species in a suitably large aquarium. 

Keeping Red Texas Cichlid in a community of large Cichlid will mean that a 6 to 8 foot long tank is a minimum with something along the lines of an 8 foot 240 gallon to 300 gallon being recommended. While they require a large aquarium if you are going to house them with other Cichlids, they can be kept alone in tanks as small as 75 gallons.

Aggression varies by individual (as with most Cichlids) and until they grow to be larger (at least 6 inches), they unlikely to display much aggression towards other tank mates. However, as they grow they will attempt to control territory within the aquarium unless there is already a dominant fish within the aquarium or the tank is over crowded preventing any one fish from dominating. 

Compatible tank mates are usually other aggressive Cichlids such as Oscars, Jaguar Cichlids, and Jack Dempsey, large Catfish, large dither fish species and Robust Plecostomus variants are also a good choice as they are naturally armored and not usually perceived as a threat.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Red Texas Cichlid is an omnivore and naturally eats worms, insects, small invertebrates, and plant matter in the wild. However, they are not picky eaters and will easily adjust to a wide variety of commercial fish foods. It is best to provide a varied diet of commercial foods with live foods being reserved as a treat or supplemental feeding, this will ensure good health and contribute to coloration intensity. 

Suitable commercial foods include: live, frozen, or freeze-dried krill, ghost shrimp, crickets, worms, as well as vitamin-enriched, omnivore oriented flake, pellet and stick food items. Feed one or twice daily an amount the fish will consume within a few minutes. Young fish should be fed more often in order to support their natural growth cycle, adult fish will do well to be fed once or twice a day. Always keep an eye on the overall girth of the fish and adjust feeding accordingly if it appears to be too thin or appears overweight.

However, as they grow they will attempt to control territory within the aquarium unless there is already a dominant fish within the aquarium or the tank is over crowded preventing any one fish from dominating. 

Compatible tank mates are usually other aggressive Cichlids such as Oscars, Jaguar Cichlids, and Jack Dempsey, large Catfish, large dither fish species and Robust Plecostomus variants are also a good choice as they are naturally armored and not usually perceived as a threat.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding & Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Red Texas Cichlid is an omnivore and naturally eats worms, insects, small invertebrates, and plant matter in the wild. However, they are not picky eaters and will easily adjust to a wide variety of commercial fish foods. It is best to provide a varied diet of commercial foods with live foods being reserved as a treat or supplemental feeding, this will ensure good health and contribute to coloration intensity. 

Suitable commercial foods include: live, frozen, or freeze-dried krill, ghost shrimp, crickets, worms, as well as vitamin-enriched, omnivore oriented flake, pellet and stick food items. Feed one or twice daily an amount the fish will consume within a few minutes. Young fish should be fed more often in order to support their natural growth cycle, adult fish will do well to be fed once or twice a day. Always keep an eye on the overall girth of the fish and adjust feeding accordingly if it appears to be too thin or appears overweight.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Spotted Severum (Heros notatus) are native to the blackwater streams and tributaries of Rio Negro basin and surrounding areas of northern Brazil. Their native river habitat is considered a blackwater biotope, as the aquatic environment in these areas has water that is stained brown from tree root and decaying leaf matter, along with filtered lighting due to the sun being heavily blocked by the thick jungle canopy. While the rivers and larger tributaries often have fast flowing waters, Spotted Severum are usually found living on marginal areas of the water ways in and amongst submerged tree root and dense aquatic vegetation.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

The Spotted Severum can be considered a community Cichlid species, as the combination of their mild temperament and larger size allows them to be kept with a wide variety of Cichlid species and even larger community fish species such as barbs, larger characins and larger sharks and loaches. They can also hold their own with semi-aggressive to aggressive Cichlid species like Oscars, Jack Dempsey, Pike Cichlids and other similar larger predators. 

Keep in mind that the Spotted Severum despite having a good temperament, will eat smaller fish that they can fit in their mouth and will be seen as food themselves by very large predators like large Snakehead, Arapaima or even very large Peacock Bass.

An aquarium of around 50 gallons should be considered a minimum size aquarium for Spotted Severum, with a pair of Severum needing an aquarium closer to 75 gallons, or if multiple tank mates are added. They ideally prefer a fine sand or small smooth gravel substrate as they will scoop sand with their mouths looking for food items. They will also greatly prefer a tank with plenty of structures for shelter, like  driftwood, rocky piles, rock formations, cave-like structures and either live or fake plants. Live plants are greatly appreciated, but do not always last long unless a prolific species is used (Anacharis, Cabomba, Hornwort); although omnivorous they have a sweet tooth for live plants and vegetables. 

High quality biological, chemical, and mechanical filtration is recommended, as they are Cichlids who with thick bodies and larger food consumption, will put out a fair amount of waste products into the water. They prefer water that is slightly acidic and soft, with a pH of 5.5 to 7.0 and a hardness of up to 10Â°H. 

Lighting intensity is not an issue; however, to best replicate their native environment some areas of shade or diffused lighting will be appreciated. This can be achieved through floating plants, thick vegetation or larger rocky cave structures. 

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Spotted Severum are omnivorous, who eat a variety of foods including: insects, small crustaceans and vegetable matter present in their natural habitat. They have a tendency to prefer a lot of vegetable matter and will accept peas, lettuce, chopped zucchini, and chopped cucumber; they should also be supplemented with a variety of meaty and vitamin enriched foods such as live, frozen or freeze-dried ghost shrimp, bloodworms, mealworms, earthworms, crickets, and nutritional cichlid and algae (Spirulina) based pellets. They will also do very well with quality stable pellet or stick foods designed for Cichlids and omnivores. It is best to feed between one to three times daily an amount of food they will consume within a few minutes.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

As the Spotted Severum is not seen for sale nearly as much other Severum species, it is believed that they are not being successfully bred in large numbers with commercial fish breeders. Most specimens commonly found within the trade are imported wild caught specimens or juvenile specimens from boutique or hobbyist breeders. 

Hobbyists looking to breed Spotted Severum (Heros notatus) will most likely find the most difficult aspect being the acquisition of a group of individuals, from which over time a mating pair can emerge. Beyond establishing a mating pair, providing a proper habitat and maintaining water conditions conducive to stimulating breeding, other aspects of breeding should be fairly common to other Severum species.

In general breeding Severum is not overly difficult, but they can often take quite a while to pair up. The parents will look for a cave or a flat rock surface or section of driftwood and the female will lay between 200-800 eggs; the male will fertilize them and then the female will tend to the eggs while the male patrols the perimeter. The eggs will hatch in 3-5 days and the fry will be relocated to a pre-dugout pit area in the substrate. The fry will be free-swimming within a week and then able to accept finely crushed flake food and baby brine shrimp. 

As with other Severum species, it may take a while for the breeding pair to get it right and it is common for the parents to eat the fry at various stages for the first dozen or so attempts. They will eventually sort things out and get it right, but the fry could also be removed and raised if continuous failed attempts are excessive.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Altolamprologus calvus (Pearly Calvus) have become very popular with African Cichlid owners as they have a slender aggressive body shape, steep sloping forehead with a large mouth and attractive coloration with stripes on the head and collar region and brilliant white spots on the posterior two-thirds of the their sides, all this combined with their easy going temperament make them a good choice for a variety of aquarium setups.  

Pearly Calvus are known for being slow growers and can take over two years to reach their maximum size of 6 inches for males and 4 inches for females.  They are found in eastern parts of Lake Tanganyikan around rocky outcrops and other areas with plenty of rock caves and crevices. There are several morphological varieties of Pearly Calvus including: black, white, yellow, and even zebra, which looks a lot like a white version of Alto. compressiceps.

Pearly Calvus make a great addition to most any Tanganyikan community setup, except for setups with much smaller fishes or shellfish, as these would most likely become a meal. They can also be kept with many of the fishes from Lakes Malawi and Victoria, provided the latter also require a high protein diet.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Pearly Calvus require an aquarium with plenty of rocks forming caves and rock ledges and crevices. When initially added to the aquarium, it is not unusual for this species to hide in the rocks most of the time. However, over time they will adapt to their new environment and spend most of their time in the lower areas of the aquarium along the substrate and lower rocky areas. It is important to not overfeed the aquarium during this period trying to get food to the Calvus, they will emerge from their rock cave when they are ready and will begin eating hardily at that time. This mimics there behavior in the wild where they spend their time along the substrate looking for shellfish and other foodstuffs to scoop up from the ground or from within rock caves. 

They are quite peaceful in the aquarium and will not fight with other fish species including similar sized species as well. While they have a good temperament for a community cichlid aquarium, they are very capable of defending themselves and will use their thick scales as both a strong defense and for inflicting damage on their attacker. Unlike many other African Cichlid species, Pearly Calvus are not territorial and will coexist with other species or others of their own kind.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Pearly Calvus are hardy eaters (once established) and will readily take most any type of high-protein meaty foods including: brine shrimp, meaty pellets, cichlid flakes and live foods. They will also consume fish species that are much smaller than themselves and will eat shellfish and crustaceans.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Pearly Calvus are substrate spawners and it is not uncommon to miss that they have spawned as they are very secretive spawners. Calvus like to spawn in tight confines such as a rocky cave, deep rocky crevice, rock overhang, inside a shell or pot or any suitable area that the male of the species cannot enter. The male will release his milt at the entrance of the females spawning location and both the male and female will use their fins to fan the milt onto the eggs, which will be dropped on the substrate. 

A typical spawn for a younger pair will number 75 eggs while a mature breeding pair will number around 200 eggs, with females being able to spawn every 30 to 40 days. The fry are very slow growers and will need upwards of 9 months to reach approximately 1 inch in size, the male young will be about 1/3rd larger than the females. While it is possible to raise the fry in the parent aquarium, the survival rate will be increased drastically if the fry are moved to a grow-out tank with a seasoned sponge filter. 

The fry calvus are bottom huggers, thus for this reason, you will need to pay extra attention to water quality as extra food can quickly foul the substrate. A mixture of Cyclops-eeze, Hikari First Start, and finely ground earthworm and brine shrimp flakes should provide the necessary nutrition with as little excess as possible.  Partial weekly water changes will help insure that proper water conditions are maintained.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The Zebra Obliquidens (Astatotilapia latifasciata) is a popular Lake Victoria species of African Cichlid, that is popular within the aquarium hobby due to its colorful appearance and peaceful disposition. This species is also bread heavily in the aquarium trade as it is heavily threatened in the wild and may be nearing extinction. 

While the females of the species are attractive in their own right, they lack the bursts of red and yellow that the males posses.  It is the bursts of red and yellow on the belly of the fish with the vertical black bars over top a silver body that makes this fish very distinguishable amongst its peers.  

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Zebra Obliquidens are a dream species for the aquarium hobby as they are very easy to care for and can easily get along well with other fish species.  They prefer neutral to moderately hard water conditions, with regular partial water changes or the presence of a high-end filtration system. It is important to provide plenty of rocky hiding places in order to provide this species with a sense of security and a place to retreat to when it feels threatened. 

They may become aggressive towards others if it is not provided with plenty of caves and crevices as it will feel the need to fight over what little cover is provided. Male Zebra Obliquidens typically get about 5 inches in length, with females reaching about 4 inches in length. While this species is a very suitable candidate for a community African Cichlid aquarium, they should not be kept with species that are much larger or overly aggressive species.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Zebra Obliquidens are omnivores (eating primarily the diet of an insectivore), thus they will eat a variety of foods ranging from plankton and insects to more meaty foods including: krill, mysis shrimp, daphnia, chichlid flake, cichlid pellets and other meaty (protein rich) preparations.  

This species is a hardy eater, that should be fed multiple times a day a diet that is rich in protein and as varied as possible, in order to provide balanced nutrition and promote a healthy immune system.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Zebra Obliquidens are prolific spawners that are easily bread within the aquarium environment. They will require a good sized aquarium of 125 gallons or greater, along with flat rocks or slate on which to lay their eggs. The females of the species will actually guard the fry for approximately 2 months after they are born, which means that the fry can be raised in the same aquarium as the parents.  

They should begin feeding almost immediately on baby brine shrimp or similar preparations and will grow quickly, reaching their distinctive shape and form in about a week.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Often regarded as a &quot;showpiece&quot; species the Frontosa Cichlid of Lake Tanganyika is a truly impressive specimen that has both great coloration and impressive body size &amp; shape with elaborate fins. Frontosa Cichlids were originally introduced into the hobby because of their attractive appearance.  However, they have become even more popular as hobbyists have learned that they have great personalities, with an almost &quot;dog&quot; like quality that has helped to endear them to hobbyists even more. 

While this species is originally from the deeper areas of Lake Tanganyika, specimens found within the aquarium hobby these days are mostly from captive breeding programs that have been successfully breeding the Frontosa Cichlid for some time. Successful captive breeding programs are important to this and many other species as pressure from aquarium hobbyist collectors and local fisherman catching them for the food supply puts far too great a strain on their native populations.

Frontosa Cichlids generally have a white or light blue body with either 6 or 7 black vertical bars along each side. As adults, they develop a large cephalic hump on the front of their head which is typically more pronounced on the male than the female. This hump is actually a large fat deposit that rests atop a dorsal muscle that tends to extend forward. The hump develops and increases in size with age and is usually a sign of sexual fecundity. 

Their fins also become more elaborate with age, which makes a mature Frontosa a very impressive sight as the combination of their large size, attractive coloration and elaborate fins make them a truly impressive sight to behold.  

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Frontosa Cichlids live relatively long (25 plus years) sedentary lifestyles in nature as they do not expend much energy while slowly swimming about or hunting. Frontosa utilize a unique trait that allows them to see well in darkness, which allows them to prey on smaller fish species while they sleep near the lake bottom. Frontosa simply swim along slowly and feast on the smaller fish as they sleep.

They are not overly aggressive within the aquarium environment, but can be a little territorial. They can be kept with most any species of African Cichlid that is not small enough to be considered as food. They will appreciate a sandy or partially sandy substrate along with some rocky formations in order to simulate their natural surroundings. 

While some rocks are much appreciated by the Frontosa Cichlid to give them a sense of security, too many rocky structures can be a problem as Frontosa are somewhat clumsy swimmers that need plenty of open space to move about. In nature Frontosa Cichlids live in large groups and prefer to live in groups in the aquarium as well. While one specimen can be kept singularly, it is more ideal to keep them in groups of 4 or more individuals. The best group makeup would be to have 3 females per male and between 4 to 8 specimens for the average larger aquarium.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

In the aquarium environment, Frontosa Cichlids should be fed a variety of meaty foods including: small feeder fish (live or frozen), shrimp, krill, and worms. Larger meaty pellets are also a good choice, but flake foods should only be fed to juveniles, as adult specimens will likely ignore them.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Caudopunctatus Cichlids are a dwarf species of Cichlid found in Africa&#039;s Lake Tanganyika. They are found living very near to the coast line, usually in depths of water of six feet or less. They move about the coastal shallows along the sandy bottom moving between the rocks and shells in search of small crustaceans on which to prey. While they spend much of their time in close proximity to rocks or shells, they do this for protection and are not &quot;true&quot; shell dwellers that will live inside of a shell. 

N. caudopunctatus is a monomorphic species as there are very few distinguishing traits between males and females. However, as adults the males will attain about 1 more inch in length than females which helps tell adult specimens apart. Another distinguishing trait is the higher level of aggression shown by males than females, with the exception of when the female is tending to eggs or newly hatched fry.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Caudopunctatus Cichlids make very interesting aquarium specimens as they are very active and will spend their time sculpting the substrate, patrolling the caves and crevices of the aquarium and overall being fun to watch. As African Cichlids go, they are not too aggressive and will do well with similarly sized tank mates of similar disposition. 

The ideal aquarium setup for N. Caudopunctatus should have a sandy substrate and plenty of rocks, shells, caves and crevices for them to explore and seek shelter in when threatened. A minimum aquarium size of 30 gallons is recommended, with a larger aquarium required for many individuals or if kept with other African cichlid species, so that they can all establish a suitable amount of territory and reduce fighting that occurs with overcrowding. 

Mixing aragonite and/or keeping plenty of shells in the aquarium with help buffer the pH and alkalinity which will help keep the water chemistry close to their native environment.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

In nature, Caudopunctatus Cichlids diet consists primarily of small invertebrates and zooplankton.  Hobbyists should feed them a varied diet of Mysis &amp; Brine shrimp, Cyclopeeze, blood worms and high quality meaty flaked &amp; pellet foods. 

It is best to provide multiple varieties of foodstuffs to help insure that the fish receives a balanced diet, which helps them maintain a strong immune system. Feedings should consist of amounts of food that the fish will consume within a few minutes fed multiple times per day.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Caudopunctatus Cichlids will breed within the aquarium environment if provided proper water chemistry, a sandy substrate, and some type of suitable aqua-scaping like rocks, shells, sinking root/driftwood or flowerpots. A mating pair of Caudopunctatus Cichlids will find a secluded location within the tank near a rock, shell or flowerpot to excavate a small nest in the substrate by creating semi-circular area at the base of their spawning site. 

The female will attach the eggs to the bottom of the rock, shell or flowerpot, where the male will fertilize the eggs then be driven off by the female. A batch of around 40 to 60 fry will hatch in about 72 hours and will become free-swimming in about 8 to 10 days. During this time the mother will look after them and attack any fish who intrude on their nesting site. 

The fry should be fed their own food designed for fry, including Daphnia, Cyclop-eeze, or freshly hatched Brine Shrimp. Crushed flake food is accepted after about two weeks of development.

763 I own 2 tanks. A 46gal Bowfront and a 8.8gal Hexagon Tank. In my 46gal tank I keep Cardinal tetras, Rummynose tetras, Black neons, Harlequins rasboras, Kuhli loaches and Skunk corys. Live plants including assorted Anubis , Hygrophilia Compacta and Java Ferns. A natural sand substrate with a Marineland Penguin 200 bio-wheel filter and 150w heater. 2 18" T-5 flouresent lights. My small tank houses all glofish. Tetras and Danios along with 2 Albino Cory. A Aqeuon 20 filter, 15w heater and small Black/neon gravel. All fake decor that glows under blue LEDs.
766 I have kept fish tanks on and off for about 20 years. I have always loved Central and South American Cichlids and recently I have gotten into Rays and Discus as well. My holy grail tank is a heavily planted Oscar Aquarium. :-)

7 AQUASCAPING THE 800 GALLON AQUARIUM Aquascaping the 800 gallon aquarium was a long time coming. I knew I wanted it to look like a river bed with the fast flowing current we had in there.

During the scape I decided to put plants in when originally I was going to wait, but it started looking so good I wanted to see it with live plants!

1 The Red Fire Guppy is a selectively bred member of the Poeciliidae family. They have quickly become one of the most popular color varieties of Guppies within the aquarium hobby due to their striking red appearance. Red Fire Guppies are very hardy, with the ability to thrive in a wide variety of water conditions and aquarium setups. They are very tolerant of small changes in water chemistry, and can be conditioned to live in aquariums that range from planted freshwater aquariums all the way to peaceful community saltwater aquariums. The Red Fire Guppy is a highly prolific live bearer species, with an average gestation period of about 20 to 30 days. Females are capable of breeding within hours of giving birth to their previous litter, combined with a fast growth rate allow their numbers to multiply quickly. Guppies have been introduced to many different locations around the world as a form of natural mosquito control. Their incredible hardiness and adaptability have enabled Guppies to thrive in their newly introduced homes, thus Guppies are now living in the wild on all of the worlds continents with the exception of Antartica. However, most Guppies available to freshwater aquarium hobbyists are selectively bred variants that are born and raised on commercial fish farms supplying the aquarium hobby.

1 [b]The Nitrogen Cycle and New Tank Syndrome[/b]

The nitrogen cycle as it pertains to the home aquarium is the process of establishing beneficial bacteria in order to break down nitrogenous waste compounds into less harmful nitrates that can be removed from the aquarium via plants or water changes.

[b]Food in equals waste out[/b]

Like all living creatures, fish give off waste products, these nitrogenous waste products break down into ammonia (NH3), which is highly toxic to both fish &amp; Invertebrates. In nature, the volume of water per fish is extremely high and waste products become diluted to low concentrations and are ultimately purified by the mass amounts of nitrofying bacteria that exist. In aquariums, however, it can take as little as a few hours for ammonia concentrations to reach toxic levels. How much ammonia is too much? The quick answer is: if a test kit is able to measure it, you&#039;ve got too much, it&#039;s in a high enough concentrations to stress fish and cause irritation. Consider emergency action such as water changes using Reverse Osmosed water or ammonia locking products, if your ammonia levels are .25ppm or higher.

[b]What Is the Nitrogen Cycle?[/b]

The Nitrogen Cycle is the biological process that converts ammonia into other, relatively harmless nitrogen compounds. Fortunately, several species of bacteria do this conversion for us. Some species convert ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (N02-), while others convert nitrite to nitrate (NO3-). Thus, cycling the tank refers to the process of establishing bacterial colonies in the filter bed that convert ammonia -&gt; nitrite -&gt; nitrate. Nitrate is only toxic at high levels that take time to accumulate and can be removed through partial water changes or aquatic plant life.

The desired species of nitrifying bacteria are present everywhere (e.g., in the air), therefore, once you have an ammonia source in your tank, its only a matter of time before the desired bacteria establish a colony in your filter bed. The most common way to do this is to seed your new aquarium using water or substrate from and existing aquarium, live rock or to place one or two (emphasis on one or two) hardy and inexpensive fish in your aquarium (damselfish and chromis are good for this purpose). The fish waste contains the ammonia on which the bacteria will live and grow, be careful not to overfeed them, causing more ammonia than can be handled by the growing bacteria bed.

[code]

[/code]
[b]New Tank Syndrome[/b]

During the cycling process, ammonia levels will vary wildly as the nitrite-forming bacteria take hold. Because nitrate-forming bacteria don&#039;t even begin to appear until nitrite is present in significant quantities, nitrite levels skyrocket (as the built-up ammonia is converted), continuing to rise as the continually-produced ammonia is converted to nitrite. Once the nitrate-forming bacteria take hold, nitrite levels fall, nitrate levels rise, and the tank is fully cycled.

[b]When is a new tank ready for fish?[/b]

Your tank is fully cycled once nitrates are being produced (and ammonia and nitrite levels are zero). To determine when the cycle has completed, you will need to have a marine water test kit, and measure the levels weekly at first and then monthly. Another possibility is to bring water samples to your local fish store and let them perform the test for you. The cycling process normally takes anywhere from 2-6 weeks, at temperatures below 70F it takes even longer to cycle a tank. In comparison to other types of bacteria, nitrifying bacteria grow slowly. Under optimal conditions; however, it can take only 15 hours for a colony to double in size! It is possible to speed up the cycling process by using bacteria based products available that will speed the process of building the nitrifying bacteria beds. The use of these products along with proper temperature, water flow and lighting can shorten the cycling process to 1-3 weeks. Reverse Osmose water should be used to limit the amount of ammonia, nitrite and silicates that are present in the water.

[b]Don&#039;t Rush It![/b]

Warning: AVOID THE TEMPTATION TO GET MORE FISH UNTIL AFTER YOUR TANK HAS FULLY CYCLED! More fish means more ammonia production, increasing the stress on all fish and the likelihood of fish deaths. Once ammonia levels reach highly stressful or toxic levels, your tank has succumbed to New Tank Syndrome; the tank has not yet fully cycled, and the accumulating ammonia has concentrations lethal to your fish. Each time you add a couple of fish you will need to allow a couple of weeks for the bacteria in your aquarium filter bed to grow in number to handle the increased amount of ammonia and filtering loads. Keep in mind that not only are you adding more fish, but you are also increasing the amount of food fed, consumed and the amount of uneated food, all of which creates higher ammonia levels.

[b]How Much Ammonia Is Too Much?[/b]

In an established tank ammonia levels should always be 0 ppm, which is undetectable using standard test kits available at stores. The presence of detectable levels indicates that your bio filter is not working adequately, either because your tank has not yet been completely cycled, or the filter is not functioning adequately (e.g. too small for fish load, clogged, etc.) It is imperative that you address the cause of the problem (filter) in addition to the symptoms (high ammonia levels).

The exact concentration at which ammonia becomes toxic to fish varies among species; some are more tolerant than others. In addition, other factors like water temperature and chemistry play a significant role. For example, ammonia (NH3) continually changes to ammonium (NH4+) and vice versa, with the relative concentrations of each depending on the water&#039;s temperature and pH. Ammonia is extremely toxic; ammonium is relatively harmless. At higher temperatures and pH, more of the nitrogen is in the toxic ammonia form than at lower pH.

[b]Speeding Up Cycling Time[/b]

The nitrogen cycle can be sped up or jump started in a number of ways. Unfortunately, they require access to an established tank, which a beginning aquarist may not have available. The basic idea is to find an established tank, take some of the bacteria out of it and place them in the new tank. Most filters have some sort of foam block or floss insert on which nitrifying bacteria attach. Borrowing all or part of such an insert and placing it in the new tanks filter gets things going more quickly. If the established tank uses an undergravel filter, nitrifying bacteria will be attached to the gravel. Take some of the gravel (a cup or more) and hang it in a mesh bag in your filter (if you can), or lay it over the top of the gravel in the new tank (if it has an UGF).

[b]In conclusion[/b]

More recently, products containing colonies of nitrifying bacteria have become available at pet shops (e.g. Fritz, Bio-zyme, Cycle). In theory, adding the bacteria jump-starts the colonization process as above. Net experience with such products has been mixed; some folks report success, while others report they don&#039;t work as well as advertised. In principle, such products should work well. However, nitrifying bacteria cannot live indefinitely without oxygen and food. Thus, the effectiveness of a product depends on its freshness and can be adversely effected by poor handling (e.g. overheating). Unfortunately, these products dont come with a freshness date, so there is no way to know how old they are.

Of course, there are many variations on the above that work. However, it is a bit difficult to give an exact recipe that is guaranteed to work. It is advisable to take a conservative approach and not add fish too quickly. In addition, testing the water to be sure nitrates are being produced eliminates the guesswork of determining when your tank has cycled. Remember that using any method to cycle your tank is going to take some time and that following the advice written here along with some patience and diligent water testing, will in the end result in a well established and enjoyable marine aquarium. [b]The Nitrogen Cycle and New Tank Syndrome[/b]

The nitrogen cycle as it pertains to the home aquarium is the process of establishing beneficial bacteria in order to break down nitrogenous waste compounds into less harmful nitrates that can be removed from the aquarium via plants or water changes.

[b]Food in equals waste out[/b]

Like all living creatures, fish give off waste products, these nitrogenous waste products break down into ammonia (NH3), which is highly toxic to both fish & Invertebrates. In nature, the volume of water per fish is extremely high and waste products become diluted to low concentrations and are ultimately purified by the mass amounts of nitrofying bacteria that exist. In aquariums, however, it can take as little as a few hours for ammonia concentrations to reach toxic levels. How much ammonia is too much? The quick answer is: if a test kit is able to measure it, you've got too much, it's in a high enough concentrations to stress fish and cause irritation. Consider emergency action such as water changes using Reverse Osmosed water or ammonia locking products, if your ammonia levels are .25ppm or higher.

[b]What Is the Nitrogen Cycle?[/b]

The Nitrogen Cycle is the biological process that converts ammonia into other, relatively harmless nitrogen compounds. Fortunately, several species of bacteria do this conversion for us. Some species convert ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (N02-), while others convert nitrite to nitrate (NO3-). Thus, cycling the tank refers to the process of establishing bacterial colonies in the filter bed that convert ammonia -> nitrite -> nitrate. Nitrate is only toxic at high levels that take time to accumulate and can be removed through partial water changes or aquatic plant life.

The desired species of nitrifying bacteria are present everywhere (e.g., in the air), therefore, once you have an ammonia source in your tank, its only a matter of time before the desired bacteria establish a colony in your filter bed. The most common way to do this is to seed your new aquarium using water or substrate from and existing aquarium, live rock or to place one or two (emphasis on one or two) hardy and inexpensive fish in your aquarium (damselfish and chromis are good for this purpose). The fish waste contains the ammonia on which the bacteria will live and grow, be careful not to overfeed them, causing more ammonia than can be handled by the growing bacteria bed.

[code]

[/code]
[b]New Tank Syndrome[/b]

During the cycling process, ammonia levels will vary wildly as the nitrite-forming bacteria take hold. Because nitrate-forming bacteria don't even begin to appear until nitrite is present in significant quantities, nitrite levels skyrocket (as the built-up ammonia is converted), continuing to rise as the continually-produced ammonia is converted to nitrite. Once the nitrate-forming bacteria take hold, nitrite levels fall, nitrate levels rise, and the tank is fully cycled.

[b]When is a new tank ready for fish?[/b]

Your tank is fully cycled once nitrates are being produced (and ammonia and nitrite levels are zero). To determine when the cycle has completed, you will need to have a marine water test kit, and measure the levels weekly at first and then monthly. Another possibility is to bring water samples to your local fish store and let them perform the test for you. The cycling process normally takes anywhere from 2-6 weeks, at temperatures below 70F it takes even longer to cycle a tank. In comparison to other types of bacteria, nitrifying bacteria grow slowly. Under optimal conditions; however, it can take only 15 hours for a colony to double in size! It is possible to speed up the cycling process by using bacteria based products available that will speed the process of building the nitrifying bacteria beds. The use of these products along with proper temperature, water flow and lighting can shorten the cycling process to 1-3 weeks.

[b]Aquarium Lighting[/b]

The past few decades have brought about an enormous amount of innovation in aquarium lighting systems for the home aquarium hobbyist. It was not that long ago when many hobbyists used &quot;shop light&quot; fixtures with basic 40 watt per tube fluorescent bulbs for their aquarium lighting. Advanced hobbyists would employ expensive metal halide solutions that required both a large up front cost and expensive on-going bulb replacement ever 9 to 12 months. Over time fluorescent aquarium fixtures based on power compact or t5 bulbs became the norm for the average hobbyist, with metal halides dominating the marine reef and other high-end aquarium setups. However, the entire aquarium lighting landscape is rapidly changing with the introduction of LED based lighting systems that combine brilliant lighting options with affordability and efficiency.

[b]LED (Light-emitting diode)[/b]

A LED or light-emitting diode is a solid state semiconductor lighting source. LEDs produce light through the use of a light-emitting diode that when switched on allows electrons to recombine with electron holes within the device, which release energy in the form of photons. Basically, LEDs are just tiny light bulbs that fit easily into an electrical circuit. However, unlike ordinary incandescent or fluorescent bulbs, they don&#039;t have a filament or gas that will burn out, and they don&#039;t get especially hot. They are illuminated solely by the movement of electrons in a semiconductor material, and they last just as long as a standard transistor. The lifespan of an LED surpasses the short life of an incandescent or fluorescent bulbs by thousands of hours. LEDs have many advantages over incandescent lighting, fluorescent lighting and even metal halide lighting sources including lower energy consumption, longer bulb lifetime, improved robustness and resistance to shock, smaller size, faster switching, and greater durability and reliability. LEDs powerful enough for aquarium lighting are relatively new to the hobby; however, new LED lighting systems are quickly becoming available to the mainstream aquarium hobbyist.

[b]Overview of LED Lighting Systems[/b]

LED Lighting Systems are capable of providing an intense amount of light in any desired kelvin temperature, while using less electricity and producing less heat than either modern fluorescent or metal halide systems. Since LEDs do not produce a lot of heat, they can be cooled through the use of heat sinks instead of bulking and noisy fans. This allows LED Lighting Systems to be exceptionally small and quiet, which means LED enclosures are often extremely thin and light. As LEDs are very small and light, they can be configured into a large variety of fixture configurations including; leg mounted on top of the aquarium, suspended pendant from above, flexible rope enclosures and even sealed underwater fixtures that allow for truly unique lighting placement. LED lights also create the shimmering lighting effect of sunlight dancing underwater as the light passes through the rippling water at the surface of the aquarium, similar to natural sunlight or metal halide lighting.

LED Aquarium Lighting Systems are quickly changing the way aquarium hobbyists illuminate their aquariums and grow plant and coral livestock. LED Aquarium Lighting Systems can be implemented in a wide variety of form factors including: strip, pendant, rope, retro-fit and completely custom configurations. The compact size and limited heat output of these systems allows hobbyists to utilize LED lighting in places and ways that they could never have done with metal halide or fluorescent lighting. LED lighting systems also reduce or eliminate all together the need for expensive equipment like water chillers and moving track systems designed to combat the excessive heat output of Metal Halide Lighting.

There are currently LED Lighting Systems from a variety of major aquarium lighting vendors that cover all aspects of the aquarium hobby from planted freshwater aquariums to coral reefs. Reef aquarium hobbyists now have a true replacement for high wattage (250 to 400 watt) Metal Halide bulbs. 400 watt metal halide lights can now be replaced with 60 watts of LED lighting without any adverse effects on corals or plants. LED Aquarium Lighting eliminates the yearly expense and hassle of replacing expensive bulbs and eliminates fading colors in corals, clams and inverts caused by bulbs that slowly lose their lighting intensity. In addition, hobbyists are able to save a significant amount of money on their electric bill through lower wattage consumption from their lighting system and less usage of cooling devices like chillers, fans and air conditioning.

3 [b]Aquarium Lighting Intensity and Quality in the Home Aquarium[/b]

[b]Overview[/b]

Aquarium lighting does far more than just illuminate the aquarium itself, proper aquarium lighting can greatly enhance the appearance of fish, plants, corals and invertebrates along with providing vital health benefits to all types of aquarium life forms. Thus, there are many important factors to consider when selecting the correct lighting system for your aquarium. When choosing the correct aquarium lighting system for a particular aquarium setup, the hobbyist needs to their best to replicate the natural lighting conditions that their aquarium inhabitants would experience in nature. Fortunately with the recent advancements in aquarium lighting systems, this has become much easier to do due to the introduction of complex lighting systems that simulate all types of natural lighting environments even night time lighting as well. In order to put together the best lighting for a particular aquariums needs, it is important to know the factors that go into deciding on which lighting system to choose.

The main factors involved in choosing the correct aquarium lighting system are the lighting spectral qualities and lighting intensity. There are many factors the affect the lighting quality and intensity of a lighting system, thus the following factors: water depth, water clarity, water movement and lighting intensity should be taken into consideration before making a lighting system decision. Understanding the natural conditions of your aquarium inhabitants and their lighting needs along with understanding your home aquarium environment are critical to implementing the best lighting solution for your aquariums needs.

[b]Lighting Spectral Qualities[/b]

Lighting Spectrum is something most aquarium hobbyists have heard about in connection with aquarium lighting, but probably do not have a full understanding about exactly what it is and what it means for their aquarium inhabitants. Sunlight is a combination of many types of light blended together, with the red, yellow and green areas of the spectrum being the ones most easily visible to the human eye. Ultraviolet, in the blue end of the spectrum, is invisible but its effect can be felt very easily as it is this end of the spectrum that causes the warm sun sensation you feel on your skin from the sun and causes sunburn when overexposure occurs. You can usually feel a quick change in temperature of your skin when a cloud passes over, this signals a decrease in the amount of radiation in a given light field. For humans prolonged exposure to this type of light is dangerous to both our skin and eyes; however, in the aquarium environment this UV radiation plays an important role in coral, plant &amp; invertebrate health and photosynthesis.

The spectrum of bulbs for aquariums are expressed as a color temperature given or stated in Kelvin degrees. Sunlight has a color temperature of about 5500K, at 12 noon over a tropical reef while actinic light sources typically have a color temperature of about 7100K. The more blue the light the higher the temperature. Light is electromagnetic energy in the form of waves, with these waves having frequencies. As the temperature of a substance increases, the frequency of the light emitted also increases, thus lower temperatures produce red and yellow light, while higher temperatures produce light ranging from white to the blue colors of the spectrum.

[code]
[/code]

In nature, as light enters and passes through the first 15 feet of water, the red and orange wavelengths are absorbed by the water, increasing the Kelvin rating of the light, and giving the light a more blue appearance. As the light penetrates to 30 feet, the water absorbs the yellow spectrum, and when the light continues past 50 feet, the water filters the green wavelengths, leaving just the blue and violet wavelengths resulting in the light with the highest Kelvin rating. This is not so noticeable in the home aquarium as we typically do not maintain aquariums with a depth of 15 or more feet!

Poor quality lighting products not intended for the aquarium hobby typically have Kelvin ratings in the 2700k to 4300K range which produces too much red and yellow light. These lighting products are not only undesirable because they do not provide the needed lighting qualities for most aquarium plants and corals, but they also promote undesirable types of nuisance algae. While the quality of aquarium lighting and its affects on aquarium inhabitants is extremely important, so is the look or aesthetics of the aquarium as well. It is important to select bulb types and spectral qualities that satisfy both the needs of your aquariums inhabitants and also provides a pleasing aesthetic for the aquarium hobbyist as well.

[b]Lighting Intensity[/b]

Lighting intensity is measured as Lux at the surface it impacts and as watts when measured at its source. Since light spreads outward and scatters in all directions, the farther we are from the source the less light we see. The intensity of light decreases by the square of the distance that area is from the lighting source. If a fluorescent bulb is moved 2 inches away from the water, it will be 4 times lower in intensity. This is an important fact to remember when placing bulbs that appear at first to have the correct amount of intensity for an aquaria. As you raise them higher above the water, the intensity will drop dramatically and you might not have the correct amount of light reaching your animals.

[code]
[/code]

Lighting intensity can be affected by other factors other than distance. Turbidity of the water can significantly reduce the actual amount of light that penetrates the surface and reaches the animals. In tanks where activated carbon is used and is changed regularly light penetration into the aquarium can be maximized. Cleaning or removing glass or acrylic lenses from the light hood will also help. The intensity of light above the surface of a reef can be as high as 130,000 lux. The actual amount of intensity that penetrates the surface of the water can be about 70,000, with maybe only 15,000 lux actually reaching the 10-15 meter mark. The water surface also reflects some of the light back, reducing the amount that penetrates the water and reaches the corals.

Light intensity at the source is measured in watts. The higher the watts, the more intense the light, and the more energy required to produce the light. A 100-watt bulb, for example, will give off more light than a 40-watt bulb, and will cost more to use. A watt is actually related to a lux in that one lux is equal to 1.46 milliwatts (0.00146 watts) of energy of one specific frequency (555 nm) hitting a surface area of one square meter. However, since bulbs used in aquarium lighting systems emit light of many frequencies (not just 555nm), no exact formula can be used when determining the number of lux produced by a bulb of a specific wattage.

[code]
[/code]

It is also very important to note that some types of aquarium light bulbs (metal halide, fluorescent, etc.) begin losing intensity long before they stop emitting light. The general rule of thumb is to replace these type of aquarium bulbs every 8 to 12 months with some reef aquarium lighting needing replacement every 6 months. These times will vary based on bulb type and lighting requirements for a particular aquarium, so one should consult the documentation for the bulb type being used.

In nature most corals and marine invertebrates live in conditions that are lit mostly by blue light waves, thus they have adapted to this and will require bulbs that produce these blue wavelengths in the aquarium environment as well. While corals and marine invertebrates thrive under blue light, most hobbyists find aquariums illuminated with blue light only to be unattractive. This aesthetic dilemma can be solved by combining an actinic light with a white light, such as a 50/50 bulb half blue/white or a light combination in which the white lights give light in the range of 8000 to 12000 K. This lighting combination gives corals and invertebrates the spectrum necessary for growth, in addition to the spectrum necessary for accurate color rendering within the aquarium.

[/code]

Lastly, it is important to consider initial and ongoing operating costs, lighting intensity and spectrum and the heat produced by the lighting system when choosing a lighting system for your marine reef aquarium. Lighting systems for reef aquariums, such as metal halide and hi-output fluorescent systems, tend to be rather expensive due to their high initial cost, high levels of required energy, and characteristically frequent bulb changes.

Lighting systems designed for reef aquariums produce two types of intense heat, which must be addressed prior to installation. The first type of heat - from the actual bulbs - surrounds the bulbs and should be removed with cooling fans. The second type of heat - radiant heat produced by the lighting system - is unavoidably absorbed by the aquarium water and should be controlled with a water chiller (be sure to budget for a water chiller in your installation plans). Fortunately a large number of LED aquarium lighting systems for both freshwater and marine environments are becoming widely available and at a variety of cost points. These newer LED lighting systems require much less energy, produce less heat, long bulb life and produce full spectrum quality light even towards the end of the bulbs life span.

[b]In conclusion[/b]

When choosing lighting for your aquarium, keep your aquarium inhabitants natural lighting conditions foremost in your mind, while still budgeting for the initial cost of the lighting system and for replacement bulbs. Other factors such as heat produced from the lighting system, physical size and dimensions of the system and airflow should also be considered before purchasing a lighting system. Having the correct wattage, Kelvin rating and lighting intensity can mean the difference between an aquarium with beautifully colored fish, thriving plants and corals and a tank overgrown with nuisance algae. [b]Aquarium Lighting Intensity and Quality in the Home Aquarium[/b]

[b]Overview[/b]

Aquarium lighting does far more than just illuminate the aquarium itself, proper aquarium lighting can greatly enhance the appearance of fish, plants, corals and invertebrates along with providing vital health benefits to all types of aquarium life forms. Thus, there are many important factors to consider when selecting the correct lighting system for your aquarium. When choosing the correct aquarium lighting system for a particular aquarium setup, the hobbyist needs to their best to replicate the natural lighting conditions that their aquarium inhabitants would experience in nature. Fortunately with the recent advancements in aquarium lighting systems, this has become much easier to do due to the introduction of complex lighting systems that simulate all types of natural lighting environments even night time lighting as well. In order to put together the best lighting for a particular aquariums needs, it is important to know the factors that go into deciding on which lighting system to choose.

The main factors involved in choosing the correct aquarium lighting system are the lighting spectral qualities and lighting intensity. There are many factors the affect the lighting quality and intensity of a lighting system, thus the following factors: water depth, water clarity, water movement and lighting intensity should be taken into consideration before making a lighting system decision. Understanding the natural conditions of your aquarium inhabitants and their lighting needs along with understanding your home aquarium environment are critical to implementing the best lighting solution for your aquariums needs.

[b]Lighting Spectral Qualities[/b]

Lighting Spectrum is something most aquarium hobbyists have heard about in connection with aquarium lighting, but probably do not have a full understanding about exactly what it is and what it means for their aquarium inhabitants. Sunlight is a combination of many types of light blended together, with the red, yellow and green areas of the spectrum being the ones most easily visible to the human eye. Ultraviolet, in the blue end of the spectrum, is invisible but its effect can be felt very easily as it is this end of the spectrum that causes the warm sun sensation you feel on your skin from the sun and causes sunburn when overexposure occurs. You can usually feel a quick change in temperature of your skin when a cloud passes over, this signals a decrease in the amount of radiation in a given light field. For humans prolonged exposure to this type of light is dangerous to both our skin and eyes; however, in the aquarium environment this UV radiation plays an important role in coral, plant & invertebrate health and photosynthesis.

The spectrum of bulbs for aquariums are expressed as a color temperature given or stated in Kelvin degrees. Sunlight has a color temperature of about 5500K, at 12 noon over a tropical reef while actinic light sources typically have a color temperature of about 7100K. The more blue the light the higher the temperature. Light is electromagnetic energy in the form of waves, with these waves having frequencies. As the temperature of a substance increases, the frequency of the light emitted also increases, thus lower temperatures produce red and yellow light, while higher temperatures produce light ranging from white to the blue colors of the spectrum.

[code]
[/code]

In nature, as light enters and passes through the first 15 feet of water, the red and orange wavelengths are absorbed by the water, increasing the Kelvin rating of the light, and giving the light a more blue appearance. As the light penetrates to 30 feet, the water absorbs the yellow spectrum, and when the light continues past 50 feet, the water filters the green wavelengths, leaving just the blue and violet wavelengths resulting in the light with the highest Kelvin rating.

4 [b]Wet/Dry Filtration Systems[/b]

[b]Overview[/b]

Wet/Dry filtration has become one of the corner stones of a well designed aquarium filtration system. Along with the general aspects of Wet/Dry filtration, this guide covers all of the benefits of this type of system including biological filtration, mechanical filtration, water oxygenation, chemical filtration and sump configurations. From the basic Wet/Dry filter to the more recent advancements in these filter systems, this guide bring the aquarium hobbyist up-to-speed on this very desirable aquarium filtration system.

Wet/Dry filtration is a method of filtration that focuses on providing biological, mechanical and chemical filtration for both marine and freshwater aquariums. Wet/Dry filters get their name because they take water from the aquarium via an overflow system and pass the water through the air over a series of porous bio-material which is usually in the form of plastic bio-balls. While this process gives the filter system its name, the modern Wet/Dry filter system does much more. While the primary task of a Wet/Dry filter is to provide biological filtration, it is also an excellent filter for both mechanical and chemical filtration as well. After siphoning the water from the aquarium via a skimmer or overflow system, the water is passed through one or more chambers containing filter pads or sponges, where mechanical filtration takes place as physical particles are removed from the water stream before they enter the trickle tower portion of the Wet/Dry filter. It is at this point that the water is passed into the trickle tower or bio-chamber where it drops down onto plastic bio-balls that are piled up on top of a plastic grate at the bottom of the chamber. This allows the water to pass through the air as it drips through the bio-ball chamber which creates an ideal environment for beneficial aerobic bacteria to live.

[code]
[/code]

It is these aerobic bacteria living on the bio-balls that perform the biological filtering of the water as they remove waste products from the water and produce oxygen. At this point the water drops down into the main sump area of the Wet/Dry Filter system, where chemical filtration can be added along with other filtration devices such as protein skimmers, activated carbon media and much more. Lastly, the water moves into the final chamber which contains the pump to return the water from the Wet/Dry filter sump back into the aquarium. Since Wet/Dry filters excel at biological filtration, they have become one of the most important ingredients to a successful aquarium filtration system. Biological filtration is the process in which ammonia is converted to the less toxic nitrite, then to the relatively non-toxic nitrate. While nitrate is non-toxic at low levels, it can build up over time and become toxic to most aquarium inhabitants. Nitrate will need to be removed from the aquarium system either through the use of live plants which consume nitrate as food or from water changes where aquarium water is removed and replaced with fresh water that is from a nitrate free source.

[code]
[/code]

[b]Biological[/b]

Wet/Dry systems earned their reputation as excellent biological filters by the method by which they stimulate bacterial growth. A successful bacteria colony requires moisture, heat and oxygen, all of which are effectively cultivated in properly maintained Wet/Dry filter systems. The temperature of your tank will provide the necessary heat for proper growth, and the moisture is taken care of by the water in your tank. The process of how the water is siphoned from the aquarium surface and trickled over the biological surface is how the Wet/Dry does the rest by providing the correct environment and living conditions for billions upon billions of beneficial aerobic bacteria colonies to live and thrive. Each Wet/Dry filter uses its own type and grade of bio material. Most filters use bio-balls, which are spherical plastic balls which are hollow and have a netted structure that provides large amounts of surface area for beneficial bacteria to live. Other Wet/Dry filter designs use a structure called Bio Bale, which looks like plastic hay, which is also very effective at stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria. New versions of bio-material and Wet/Dry configurations are popping up within the hobby as filter manufacturers look to further improve on what is already a very effective design.

[code]
[/code]

[b]Oxygenation[/b]

The initial process of skimming the water from the aquariums surface and returning it via the surface of the water creates excellent water agitation which saturates the water with large amounts of dissolved oxygen. On top of this process, when the water enters the Wet/Dry filter from your tank, it is poured over the biomaterial at a high velocity, as the water flows over the material it mixes with the surrounding air, supersaturating the water with oxygen. It is this mixing affect that contributes to the name Wet/Dry filtration. There are even opportunities within the sump portion of the Wet/Dry filter itself for oxygen to be introduced into the water via the return from a device such as a protein skimmer or by passing over additional filter media or substrates where more beneficial bacteria may be present.

While all models of Wet/Dry filters have mechanical filtration via pre-filters in the skimmer box to filtration trays located above the bio material, newer model Wet/Dry filters are constantly improving on this by providing more physical filtration in the form of micro mesh bags, sponge filters and media pads located in various locations throughout the filter system. Any of the Wet/Dry filter systems commonly available within the aquarium hobby provide not only excellent biological filtration, but top notch mechanical filtration as well. Additional mechanical filtration would only be necessary in the most extreme of cases where the aquarium inhabitants produce large amounts of physical waste.

[b]The Sump[/b]

The sump area of the Wet/Dry filter system allows the hobbyist a convenient location to locate chemical filtration, protein skimmers, live rock (saltwater setup), plants, macro algae and much more. It is now quite common for Wet/Dry filter systems to come with expanded sump sections to allow hobbyists to keep a variety of additional filters and even create refugiums and plant based vegetable filters. All of these additional forms of filtration make the Wet/Dry filter a complete all-in-one filtration system that is capable of handling all types of marine or freshwater aquarium setups.

Due to their popularity, they have expanded with many different variations of the standard Wet/Dry system with expanded sumps, refugiums, Berlin style setups and many more. Be sure to carefully investigate your options when setting up your next aquarium and find the right Wet/Dry system to fit your aquarium goals. [b]Wet/Dry Filtration Systems[/b]

5 [b]Introduction to Acropora Corals for the Beginner Reef Aquarium Hobbyist[/b]


[b]Introduction[/b]

Acropora corals are highly adaptive, opportunistic and fast growing, which has made them a very popular species in reef aquarium hobby. Acropora can be found in a variety of grow forms ranging from plates to staghorns and a variety of colors. With the popularity and variety of this coral an entire website could be dedicated to their selection and husbandry. However, this guide will introduce the various varieties of Acropora and will cover their scientific background and information related to Acropora within the context of the reef aquarium hobby environment.

[/code]

[b]Scientific Information[/b]

Genus Acropora (ak-roh-pohr-ah) is part of the largest family and most important contributor to coral reef formations in the world. The two primary genera Acropora and Montipora together account for almost one-third of all hermatypic or reef-building coral species. While found in both the pacific and atlantic oceans, Acropora is far more dominantly found in the Pacific ocean as there are only 3 known species of Acropora in the Atlantic. Acropora contain specialized axial corallite, which do not contain zooxanthellae, but allow for a very rapid growth rate, as they are fed by other areas of the colony. This allows for the genus to have a advantage over other corals in that they can outgrow them and rapidly colonize the reef. These fast growing Acropora branches can be identified by their light-colored tips, which are almost white or brightly hued.

[b]About Acropora Corals[/b]

There are 13 to 15 basic growth forms of Acropora that vary according to size and shape of the branches, the position of the brances, the number of corallite septa and the nature of the coenosteum. The most commonly available aquarium species tend to fall into the following growth forms: branching, bushy, cluster, finger, bottlebrush and tabular. In the aquarium hobby , species are generally sold by form and color as oppossed to the species i.e. purple staghorn or pink bottlebrush. This is understandable, but can make it difficult in providing a species designation, which is then left upto the aquarist.

Acropora are highly diverse and adaptable, which makes figuring out the best aquarium conditions difficult. Specimens have been collected in a multitude of areas including areas of strong water current and intense lighting to deep water areas and calm lagoons. Pretty much anywhere coral reefs can be found, Acropora can also be found there thriving. Discussed in the next section, growth forms and not species are probably the better indicator of the natural location of the coral. Coloration of Acropora is even more diverse than the growth forms, with almost every hue of the rainbow possible.

[b]Acropora Corals in the Home Reef Aquarium[/b]

Acropora in the wild are highly adaptable and can exist in a variety of locations including: calm lagoons, pounding reef crests and even reef flats where they can be out of water for periods of time. They tolerate huge differences in light intensity, water movement and even salinity, thus one would think that they would extremely easy to keep in the reef aquarium, but nothing could be further from the truth. In fact they are very demanding of their conditions when housed in captivity. However, once they are acclimated to aquarium life, and if kept with stable water conditions, they will also thrive in the reef aquarium.

Generally speaking, Acropora species with thick branches are normally more difficult to keep than those with thin branches. This is most likely because of the inability of reef aquarists to provide enough water flow that the thick branched species need to thrive, thus making these species more prone initially to problems. Brown specimens, bottlebrush and thin branched species tend to be more tolerant of the lower water flow and light level conditions. Tabletop species are among the most difficult Acropora species to keep in the home reef aquarium, with staghorn specimens being somewhere in the middle.

[/code]

Captive-bred or frag specimens seem to be generally healthier and easier to care for than wild specimens. Nonetheless, all Acropora specimens seem to prefer strong, random or mixing type water current with intense lighting and high levels of calcium and strontium to promote maximum growth and health. Water quality should also be excellent and very stable, thus Acropora do much better in established reef aquariums where water parameters are generally more stable.

[/code]

[b]In conclusion[/b]

Acropora need to be acclimated carefully to their new surroundings so that they are not shocked by light, water parameter changes or other stresses. They should also be located in their final position as quickly as possibly to avoid stress or unfulfilled metabolic needs. Typical stressors include: low light, low water current and frequent movement from different positions in the aquarium. They do not tolerate sudden changes in aquarium conditions, especially water temperature and will fade in color, recede in growth or even die if proper water conditions are not maintained. While frag or captive-bred species do best, they often require about 6 months to regain full normal growth rates. Acropora are also susceptible to most known coral diseases including: white-band disease, black-band disease, recession, etc. While Acropora are a demanding species to keep in captivity, it is possible to keep them successfully and can be an extremely rewarding coral to keep and raise. Hopefully the information in this article along with the experience obtained from keeping corals in the reef aquarium will help increase the likelyhood that these corals can not only be kept successfully in the reef aquarium, but also thrive as well. [b]Introduction to Acropora Corals for the Beginner Reef Aquarium Hobbyist[/b]


[b]Introduction[/b]

Acropora corals are highly adaptive, opportunistic and fast growing, which has made them a very popular species in reef aquarium hobby. Acropora can be found in a variety of grow forms ranging from plates to staghorns and a variety of colors. With the popularity and variety of this coral an entire website could be dedicated to their selection and husbandry. However, this guide will introduce the various varieties of Acropora and will cover their scientific background and information related to Acropora within the context of the reef aquarium hobby environment.

[b]Scientific Information[/b]

Genus Acropora (ak-roh-pohr-ah) is part of the largest family and most important contributor to coral reef formations in the world. The two primary genera Acropora and Montipora together account for almost one-third of all hermatypic or reef-building coral species. While found in both the pacific and atlantic oceans, Acropora is far more dominantly found in the Pacific ocean as there are only 3 known species of Acropora in the Atlantic. Acropora contain specialized axial corallite, which do not contain zooxanthellae, but allow for a very rapid growth rate, as they are fed by other areas of the colony. This allows for the genus to have a advantage over other corals in that they can outgrow them and rapidly colonize the reef. These fast growing Acropora branches can be identified by their light-colored tips, which are almost white or brightly hued.

6 [b]Acclimating Corals to the marine reef aquarium[/b]

After selecting the perfect new Coral colony for their aquarium, the marine reef hobbyist should take the necessary steps to safely add their new marine coral to its new aquatic home. The recommended steps are clearly laid out, so that a hobbyist of any level will benefit from this blog. Notes and warnings are included for areas that require special attention or are common areas where new hobbyists typically make mistakes.

[b]Why we need to Acclimate Corals[/b]

The vast majority of aquarium hobbyists strive to provide the best possible environment and care for all of their aquariums inhabitants. It is because of this attention to excellent husbandry, that collectively as a hobby, reef aquarists have learned the best methods in which to introduce and maintain corals within the aquarium environment. There is probably no more critical time for a coral than during the process of being transported home and introduced into the hobbyists reef aquarium. During this period of time the coral will be subjected to many stresses, that while inevitable, can be greatly reduced through the care and technique that the marine aquarium hobbyist uses to introduce the new coral into its new home. In order to safely acclimate Corals into an already established aquarium it is important to closely follow this proven set of procedures designed to limit any stress on the new specimen and get it acclimated as quickly as possible.

[code]

[/code]
It is highly recommended to look over all the steps ahead of time and be sure to have all the necesarry items handy and ready to go prior to the arrival of the new coral specimen. This acclimation procedure is a safe and easy way to introduce Corals from the relatively stressful water chemistry of its shipping bag to the healthy and safe conditions of its new home. Though it may seem like the best course of action is to get your new specimen into your clean aquarium as soon as possible, it is extremely important to note that rapid changes in water conditions or chemistry can be more dangerous to an aquatic animal than being kept longer in an unhealthy environment. It is this slow transition from shipping container to established tank that is the focus of this acclimation procedure.

Note: It is generally recommended that all newly purchased specimens be quarantined in a separate tank before introduction to the population of your established aquarium; however, the acclimation process is the same either way (assuming the quarantine tank has the same water chemistry as the main aquarium).

[/code]
[b]Acclimating corals into an established reef aquarium[/b]

Note: This procedure should not take any more than 1 hour to complete.

Important Note: Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium.

Before you start, you will need the following:

[ul]
[li]Non-abrasive net
[li]Plastic or glass cup
[li]Clean plastic or glass container to keep the specimen during the acclimation process
[li]A means to access water from your aquarium
[li]Aquarium Thermometer
[/ul]

Steps to take to properly acclimate a new Coral specimen

[ul]
[li]Open the bag or shipping container and carefully place coral with the water from the bag into the empty bucket or container.[/li]
[li]Add 1 cup of your aquarium water to the bucket slowly.[/li]
[li]Repeat this process adding 1 cup of aquarium water every 5 minutes for 30 minutes.[/li]
[li]Dim or turn off the aquarium lights to help minimize stress on the new coral.[/li]
[li]Carefully remove the coral or clam from the bucket. Be extremely careful when handling live corals not to touch the delicate flesh of the animals. Try to handle the corals only by their hard skeletons or the plug or coral rubble that they are attached to whenever possible.[/li]
[li]Place your new coral in a location within your reef community that will not place the newly introduced specimens too close to other well established or aggressive species, as they will sting their new competitors. Check on compatibility issues to see where your new coral should be placed in its new home. Remember that many aggressive coral species extend their sweeper tentacles mainly at night, so what may seem to be a peaceful environment during daylight hours may not be once the lights go out.[/li]
[li]Discard the water left in the bucket. EXCEPTION: Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium.[/li]
[li]Keep the aquarium lights off or at a low level and gradually work up to a higher level, allowing the coral(s) time to adjust before returning lighting to full operating levels. This process should ideally occur over a 2 to 3 hour period.[/li]
[li]At this time your coral species will be ready to coexist with its fellow tank mates.[/li]

[code]

[/code]
[b]Conclusion[/b]

By following these steps a reef aquarium hobbyist of any level should be able to properly acclimate a new coral specimen to their established reef aquarium. It is also recommended that the aquarium hobbyist pay close attention to their new coral specimen(s) during acclimation and in the short term afterwords to verify that the coral is doing well and taking to its new environment.

Helpful Hints:

[ul]
[li]When Acclimating corals, begin with a low level of lighting and gradually work up to a higher level, allowing the coral(s) time to adjust before lighting increases.[/li]
[li]Never introduce an airstone or any other form of aeration into the shipping bag. Aerating the water inside the shipping bag will only convert non-toxic ammonia to a toxic form that will be extremely harmful to the animal.[/li]
[li]Never expose sponges and gorganians (sea fans) to open air. This is the only case where you will have to introduce some of the bag water into your aquarium. THESE SPECIES MUST BE KEPT UNDER WATER AT ALL TIMES.[/li]
[li]Do not be too anxious to admire your new specimen. Allow them to adjust to their new home before you expose them to bright lights and attention.[/li]

7 [b]Stocking a Marine Fish-Only / FOWLR Aquarium[/b]

This guide is intended to help out hobbyists who are new to keeping saltwater fish or new to the aquarium hobby in general and would like to start off with a saltwater aquarium. The livestock stocking advice given is intended to be somewhat generic in nature in that it is based on basic filtration, water flow and beginning marine aquarium experience. While advanced filtration, protein skimming, live rock, water changes, sumps with live plants or algae scrubbers will greatly enhance the number of fish on can keep and the speed at which they are added to the aquarium, this guide assumes basic filtration in the form of a simple wet/dry filter or canister filter. We will touch on all the major factors that are involved with properly stocking a saltwater fish-only or FOWLR aquarium and all recommendations will error on the side of caution. The goal of this beginners guide is to give the beginning marine aquarium hobbyist a solid footing with which to make good decisions on how many and which fish they should keep in their new marine aquarium.

[code]

[code]

[/code]

When stocking a saltwater fish-only aquarium, there are four main areas to consider before you invest in your first fish. These four very important aspects of stocking a marine aquarium are dissolved water chemistry, filtration system capabilities, fish compatibility and fish size &amp; swimming habits, all of which are factors in selecting fish livestock. The following discussion breaks down each of these areas to provide the beginning marine aquarium hobbyist with the basic information they will need to quickly be on your way to successfully stocking your marine fish aquarium.

[b]Water Chemistry[/b]

Water chemistry is a good place to start when deciding which type of live stock to keep within a marine fish-only tank. While many fish sold within the marine aquarium hobby are tropical reef fish who require warm water 78 Â° to 82 Â° with a lot of water movement and high levels of dissolved oxygen, others require colder water temperatures and only moderate water flow. Different fish also have widely different tolerances for dissolved nutrients in the water like nitrate, while Clownfish, Damselfish and other can tolerate higher nitrate levels, other fish like Butterflyfish and Anthias are much more sensitive to higher nitrate levels. Ultimately, the hobbyist will need to choose between a warmer tropical water aquarium or a cold water aquarium.

After deciding on water temperature, comes decisions on how much internal water flow the aquarium will have and how much of the filtration will be dedicated to nutrient export. Hardy fish species can be kept in aquariums with moderate water flow from the filtration return pump and a basic powerhead, while most reef fish or fish considered moderate in difficulty to keep will require strong waterflow that only multiple powerheads will be able to provide. Always provide water flow that is laminar or varied, either through the use of a controller or through strategic placement of powerheads. In larger aquariums powerheads can be placed near the surface and directed to push water towards each other, which will ultimately produce laminar or varied water flow; however, most hobbyists will want use a powerhead with a controller so that water flow can controlled in order to provide bursts of current. Constant, strong water flow is not desirable for fish, substrate or plants or corals.

[code]

[code]

[/code]

The last aspect of water chemistry to consider before selecting fish livestock is the level of nutrient export capabilities of the filtration system. Modern wet/dry filters, canisters and even bio-wheel power filters are cable of breaking down toxic compounds like ammonia and nitrite very efficiently. However, what is left over is nitrate, which over time can build up to high levels. High levels of nitrate will cause stress and reduced overall health to many fish species; as well as, promote nuisance algae growth and overall poor water conditions. While water changes using clean RO/DI based saltwater can reduce nitrate levels, hobbyists will ultimately need to employ filtration methods specifically designed to export or reduce the nitrate levels in the aquarium. In order to keep fish that are considered moderate to difficult to keep, hobbyists will need to employ one or more of the following nutrient export filtration techniques: protein skimming, frequent water changes using RO/DI water and a quality salt mix, large quantity of live rock, sump with fast growing live plants or an algae scrubber solution. Any of these nutrient export solutions can be effective at keeping water quality high and dissolved nitrates low; however, the use of more than one of these techniques at the same time is recommended as they are much more effective when used together.

[b]Filtration System[/b]

As you can probably guess from the water chemistry section, filtration systems have a huge impact on keeping quality water and determining the overall fish load an aquarium can support. Since this guide is specific to fish stocking in a marine aquarium, we will only discuss filtration as it pertains to fish stocking levels. All saltwater fish aquariums will require mechanical filtration, biological filtration and good internal water flow, with water flow affecting both for dissolved oxygen and to assist the mechanical filtration with removing solids. Marine aquariums with light to moderate fish stock levels, which translates to about 1 inch of fish per 5 gallons of water can be successfully maintained by using either a high-end bio-wheel power filter, high-end canister filter or wet/dry filter, combined with powerheads for internal water movement and regular water changes. Adding live rock and a protein skimmer can increase the fish load to 1 inch of fish per 3 gallons and extend the time between water changes. While the further addition of a sump with live plants or an algae scrubber for nutrient export can further increase stocking levels to 1 inch of fish per 2 gallons of water volume. All fish stocking recommendations are based on a tank that is fully cycled and biologically mature. When a tank is first established and the beneficial bacteria are just forming, it is important to move slowly with fish additions and test the water every few days. Weekly water changes and a reduced feeding regimen will also help take the load off of a maturing filtration system. With all new tank setups, fish should be added slowly with one or two fish being added every 2 to 3 weeks, which will allow the filtration system and beneficial bacteria to adjust to the increase in waste products.

[code]

[/code]

After an aquarium is fully mature (approximately 1 year) hobbyists can utilize combinations of filtration techniques and water changes to increase fish loads above what is recommended here. Many factors come into play when giving advice on the fish load an established aquarium can support; however, always remember to work with nature and provide the proper environment to support the nitrogen cycle and move slow to allow beneficial bacteria to do their work. Hobbyists who maintain high levels of dissolved oxygen through laminar water flow, use live rock and live sand, utilize protein skimmers, use sumps for plant or algae nutrient export and last but not least use a RO/DI unit to provide quality water for top off and water changes, will find that keeping a marine aquarium does not have to be difficult and is very enjoyable.

[b]Fish Compatibility[/b]

Fish Compatibility as it pertains to stocking levels in an aquarium is more than just fish fighting with one another. Of course if incompatible fish are kept together their constant fighting will likely mean that some fish will become stressed and likely get sick and die. However, another factor of fish compatibility involves available territory within the aquarium. While a number of marine reef fish like Chromis, Anthias and some Tang species will readily school together within the aquarium, most reef fish attempt to stake out territory within the aquarium. This territory is usually based on feeding habits and shelter, where fish will look for an area within the aquarium that has good caves and crevices in which to retreat to when threatened and in which to sleep, and where they can readily find food to eat. Problems occur when fish are kept together and they see one another as competition for both food and shelter. An prime example of this is keeping multiple dwarf marine angelfish in small to medium sized aquariums, they will both try to claim either the entire tank or most of it as their territory, where often the loser is marginalized to one small area of the tank or simply becomes stressed, becomes ill and dies. Unless you have a very large aquarium (hundreds of gallons) it is very important to keep fish species who will not compete with one another and are accepting of sharing the same territory or space within the aquarium.

[b]Fish Size &amp; Swimming Habits[/b]

The adult size of each fish and how much room they need to swim comfortably within the aquarium ties into the overall compatibility and ultimately the health of aquarium livestock. In general, fish species that grow larger like Angelfish, Triggerfish, Groupers, Surgeonfish and others are typically more aggressive than fish species who only grow a few inches in length. This directly effects the amount of space they need to feel comfortable within the aquarium. While smaller fish are happy to hang out near a rocky crevice or swim in a school with others of their species, larger more aggressive fish will want to claim a larger area of the aquarium and will generally not tolerate any other fish they see as competition for food or dominance. Also in the case of some fish like fast swimming open water Surgeonfish, Sharks, Rays or other similar species, their unique size and swimming habits may make them less suitable to be kept with other smaller or more shy fish species. Ultimately, fish stocking is more than just a calculation of inch of fish per gallon or employing the best filtration systems, it is a balance between fish, their tank mates and their aquarium environment.

[b]In Conclusion[/b]

Make sure you have a good understanding of the Nitrogen Cycle and how it works in an aquatic environment, utilize the best combination of filtration systems that you can afford. Be sure to cover the basics, breakdown or remove waste products, provide plenty of dissolved oxygen, export nutrients from the aquarium and provide fresh water and beneficial trace elements through water changes. And remember go slow, during the first six months to a year, give time for your filtration system to catch up each time you add new fish (usually 2 to 3 weeks) and do your best to recreate the methods mother nature uses. By providing high oxygen levels, biological filtration, protein skimming, proper color temperature (10k - 20k) lighting, controlled additions of new tank mates and keeping in mind the adult size, compatibility requirements of new specimens and you will guarantee yourself many years of successful marine fish keeping. Good Luck!

[/code] [b]Stocking a Marine Fish-Only / FOWLR Aquarium[/b]

This guide is intended to help out hobbyists who are new to keeping saltwater fish or new to the aquarium hobby in general and would like to start off with a saltwater aquarium. The livestock stocking advice given is intended to be somewhat generic in nature in that it is based on basic filtration, water flow and beginning marine aquarium experience. While advanced filtration, protein skimming, live rock, water changes, sumps with live plants or algae scrubbers will greatly enhance the number of fish on can keep and the speed at which they are added to the aquarium, this guide assumes basic filtration in the form of a simple wet/dry filter or canister filter. We will touch on all the major factors that are involved with properly stocking a saltwater fish-only or FOWLR aquarium and all recommendations will error on the side of caution. The goal of this beginners guide is to give the beginning marine aquarium hobbyist a solid footing with which to make good decisions on how many and which fish they should keep in their new marine aquarium.

[/code]

When stocking a saltwater fish-only aquarium, there are four main areas to consider before you invest in your first fish. These four very important aspects of stocking a marine aquarium are dissolved water chemistry, filtration system capabilities, fish compatibility and fish size & swimming habits, all of which are factors in selecting fish livestock. The following discussion breaks down each of these areas to provide the beginning marine aquarium hobbyist with the basic information they will need to quickly be on your way to successfully stocking your marine fish aquarium.

[b]Water Chemistry[/b]

Water chemistry is a good place to start when deciding which type of live stock to keep within a marine fish-only tank. While many fish sold within the marine aquarium hobby are tropical reef fish who require warm water 78 Â° to 82 Â° with a lot of water movement and high levels of dissolved oxygen, others require colder water temperatures and only moderate water flow. Different fish also have widely different tolerances for dissolved nutrients in the water like nitrate, while Clownfish, Damselfish and other can tolerate higher nitrate levels, other fish like Butterflyfish and Anthias are much more sensitive to higher nitrate levels. Ultimately, the hobbyist will need to choose between a warmer tropical water aquarium or a cold water aquarium.

After deciding on water temperature, comes decisions on how much internal water flow the aquarium will have and how much of the filtration will be dedicated to nutrient export. Hardy fish species can be kept in aquariums with moderate water flow from the filtration return pump and a basic powerhead, while most reef fish or fish considered moderate in difficulty to keep will require strong waterflow that only multiple powerheads will be able to provide. Always provide water flow that is laminar or varied, either through the use of a controller or through strategic placement of powerheads. In larger aquariums powerheads can be placed near the surface and directed to push water towards each other, which will ultimately produce laminar or varied water flow; however, most hobbyists will want use a powerhead with a controller so that water flow can controlled in order to provide bursts of current. Constant, strong water flow is not desirable for fish, substrate or plants or corals.

[code]

[/code]

The last aspect of water chemistry to consider before selecting fish livestock is the level of nutrient export capabilities of the filtration system. Modern wet/dry filters, canisters and even bio-wheel power filters are cable of breaking down toxic compounds like ammonia and nitrite very efficiently. However, what is left over is nitrate, which over time can build up to high levels. High levels of nitrate will cause stress and reduced overall health to many fish species; as well as, promote nuisance algae growth and overall poor water conditions. While water changes using clean RO/DI based saltwater can reduce nitrate levels, hobbyists will ultimately need to employ filtration methods specifically designed to export or reduce the nitrate levels in the aquarium. In order to keep fish that are considered moderate to difficult to keep, hobbyists will need to employ one or more of the following nutrient export filtration techniques: protein skimming, frequent water changes using RO/DI water and a quality salt mix, large quantity of live rock, sump with fast growing live plants or an algae scrubber solution. Any of these nutrient export solutions can be effective at keeping water quality high and dissolved nitrates low; however, the use of more than one of these techniques at the same time is recommended as they are much more effective when used together.

[b]Filtration System[/b]

As you can probably guess from the water chemistry section, filtration systems have a huge impact on keeping quality water and determining the overall fish load an aquarium can support. Since this guide is specific to fish stocking in a marine aquarium, we will only discuss filtration as it pertains to fish stocking levels. All saltwater fish aquariums will require mechanical filtration, biological filtration and good internal water flow, with water flow affecting both for dissolved oxygen and to assist the mechanical filtration with removing solids. Marine aquariums with light to moderate fish stock levels, which translates to about 1 inch of fish per 5 gallons of water can be successfully maintained by using either a high-end bio-wheel power filter, high-end canister filter or wet/dry filter, combined with powerheads for internal water movement and regular water changes. Adding live rock and a protein skimmer can increase the fish load to 1 inch of fish per 3 gallons and extend the time between water changes. While the further addition of a sump with live plants or an algae scrubber for nutrient export can further increase stocking levels to 1 inch of fish per 2 gallons of water volume. All fish stocking recommendations are based on a tank that is fully cycled and biologically mature. When a tank is first established and the beneficial bacteria are just forming, it is important to move slowly with fish additions and test the water every few days. Weekly water changes and a reduced feeding regimen will also help take the load off of a maturing filtration system. With all new tank setups, fish should be added slowly with one or two fish being added every 2 to 3 weeks, which will allow the filtration system and beneficial bacteria to adjust to the increase in waste products.

[code]

[/code]

After an aquarium is fully mature (approximately 1 year) hobbyists can utilize combinations of filtration techniques and water changes to increase fish loads above what is recommended here. Many factors come into play when giving advice on the fish load an established aquarium can support; however, always remember to work with nature and provide the proper environment to support the nitrogen cycle and move slow to allow beneficial bacteria to do their work. Hobbyists who maintain high levels of dissolved oxygen through laminar water flow, use live rock and live sand, utilize protein skimmers, use sumps for plant or algae nutrient export and last but not least use a RO/DI unit to provide quality water for top off and water changes, will find that keeping a marine aquarium does not have to be difficult and is very enjoyable.

[b]Fish Compatibility[/b]

Fish Compatibility as it pertains to stocking levels in an aquarium is more than just fish fighting with one another. Of course if incompatible fish are kept together their constant fighting will likely mean that some fish will become stressed and likely get sick and die. However, another factor of fish compatibility involves available territory within the aquarium. While a number of marine reef fish like Chromis, Anthias and some Tang species will readily school together within the aquarium, most reef fish attempt to stake out territory within the aquarium. This territory is usually based on feeding habits and shelter, where fish will look for an area within the aquarium that has good caves and crevices in which to retreat to when threatened and in which to sleep, and where they can readily find food to eat. Problems occur when fish are kept together and they see one another as competition for both food and shelter. An prime example of this is keeping multiple dwarf marine angelfish in small to medium sized aquariums, they will both try to claim either the entire tank or most of it as their territory, where often the loser is marginalized to one small area of the tank or simply becomes stressed, becomes ill and dies. Unless you have a very large aquarium (hundreds of gallons) it is very important to keep fish species who will not compete with one another and are accepting of sharing the same territory or space within the aquarium.

[b]Fish Size & Swimming Habits[/b]

The adult size of each fish and how much room they need to swim comfortably within the aquarium ties into the overall compatibility and ultimately the health of aquarium livestock. In general, fish species that grow larger like Angelfish, Triggerfish, Groupers, Surgeonfish and others are typically more aggressive than fish species who only grow a few inches in length.

Ultimately, fish stocking is more than just a calculation of inch of fish per gallon or employing the best filtration systems, it is a balance between fish, their tank mates and their aquarium environment.

8 Water Dogs! A crash course in keeping Oscar Cichlids

Astronotus ocellatus, also known as the Oscar, is a fresh water species which is a member of the Cichlid family. Wild Oscars are native to the Amazon River basin (as well as the Orinoco and Paraguay basins) in South America. In their natural environment Oscars are typically found in slow moving, whitewater to blackwater environments and can be found taking cover around and within submerged trees, roots, rocks, vegetation and driftwood.

[code]
[/code]
Oscars are one of the hardiest and most popular Cichlids in the hobby and they can learn to distinguish their owner(s) from strangers as well as associate them with food. Oscars are very intelligent and will develop and display unique and interesting personalities. In addition to their constant &quot;begging&quot; for food, Oscars can also be trained to eat from their owner&#039;s hand; which is why they are sometimes referred to as river or water dogs.

[b]Choosing your Oscar:[/b]

The original species of Astronotus ocellatus is the Wild Oscar (also referred to as the Common Oscar); the Wild Oscar is the only Oscar that can be found in it&#039;s natural habitat in the wild (aside from various &quot;pets&quot; that have been released in ponds, lakes, canals, and rivers within sub-tropical or tropical environments). All other varieties of the Oscar have been bred exclusively for the aquarium trade, including varieties with red marbling, albino, leucistic, and xanthistic. Red Oscars, Tiger Oscars, Red Tiger Oscars, Red Lutino Oscars, Lemon Oscars, Platinum Oscars, Gold Oscars, Copper Oscars, Albino Tiger Oscars, Albino Red Oscars... the list goes on. There are also veil-tail (long-finned) versions of all the various forms in the aquarium trade, but it&#039;s not recommended that they be kept with other Oscars or aggressive Cichlids; as their fins are delicate and are prone to damage, which can cause various fin diseases or infections.

When choosing an Oscar, make sure to examine it closely before you decide to purchase it. Keep an eye out for the ones that are very alert and active. Don&#039;t choose one that is acting completely different from the rest, seems to be lethargic or just happens to be lying on the bottom of the tank pouting or possibly not feeling too well. A healthy Oscar is always alert and looking for food.

If you plan to purchase a mature Oscar, keep an eye out for any pitting or holes that may have devleoped on it&#039;s head; It&#039;s a sure sign of Hole in the Head Disease.

Also make sure your future pet Oscar does not have any small white spots (similar to tiny grains of salt) on it as it&#039;s a sure sign that it has been infected by Ick (an Ichthyophthirius multifilis parasite).

[b]So, you brought home a new Oscar for your tank...[/b]

The water chemistry at a fish store is usually fairly neutral at a pH of around 7.0 and the GH and KH can very greatly, not to mention that it can also contain various nasty parasites. When introducing a new Oscar to a tank, you can&#039;t go wrong with the &quot;drip&quot; method as even baby Oscars have been known to tear little holes in the store bags and nobody wants fish store water in their tanks.

Carefully empty the contents of the bag (including the water) into a container. Take some airline tubing and set up a siphon drip line from the target aquarium to the container with your new Oscar. If you don&#039;t have an airline control valve handy, you can tie a couple loose knots in the airline to control the rate of water flow (it&#039;s also recommended that you secure the airline tubing in place with an airline holder or some other method). Start a siphon by sucking on the end of the airline tubing you&#039;ll be placing into the container. When water begins flowing through the tubing, it&#039;s time to adjust the drip (either by adjusting the control valve or tightening one or both of the knots) to a rate of 2-4 drips per second. When the amount of water in the bucket doubles, empty half of it and start the drip again until the volume doubles again. Repeat this process for about one hour and then your new Oscar is ready to be netted and moved to your target aquarium.

New Oscars will often pout. If your new Oscar swims to the bottom of the tank and lays on one side, looking up at you with an untrusting eye, don&#039;t panic, it may just be a little stressed and will soon get over it and snap into action, exploring its new home. Current, resident Oscars consider new Oscars a threat as well as intruders in their territory. The bigger the Oscars are, the bigger the fight can be. They will sort things out, but there maybe be a few bruises and hurt feelings in the process.

[b]In the Aquarium:[/b]

Oscars are excellent for breaking in a beginning Cichlid hobbyist as they are a very hardy species and their owner(s) will learn a lot about the care and habits of predatory fish, water conditions, filtration and how much fun it can be to have a Cichlid tank. Oscars can live for 12 to 16 years and it&#039;s important to understand that Oscars are a long-term commitment.

In their natural environment, Oscars can be found in acidic blackwater conditions as well as neutral whitewater conditions with a pH anywhere from 4.5 to 7.5. In an aquarium environment, Oscars will thrive in conditions with a pH ranging from 5.0 to 7.0 and a temperature between 74 degrees F to 84 degrees F; When it comes to water hardness, the GH should be around 3 to 7 and the KH ranging from 2 to 4.

Oscars are one of the fastest growing aquarium fish in the hobby and baby Oscars are usually sold at the fish store at around one to two inches long. Those babies will easily gain one inch a month for the first eight months. Expect those babies to be seven or eight inches by the time they are a year old. Ideally, a single Oscar should be kept in a tank that is no less than 75 gallons and a 110-125 gallon tank is recommended for two. Oscars are greedy, big and messy eaters and produce a considerable biological load within their environment. Therefore, the two most vital components for Oscars are tank size and filtration; a large tank with an efficient amount of quality filtration will play a vital role in keeping your Oscar(s) happy and healthy.

Oscars love to decorate and will rearrange their environment to their liking by digging large pits within the substrate and relocating rocks and other objects (including submersed heaters and thermometers). Oscars are very powerful fish and can and will move almost anything in the tank aside from large pieces of driftwood. As far as live plants go, Amazon and various Swords are recommended as they will grow powerful root structures and may be too difficult to move. Most other live plants will either be uprooted or shredded. Oscars have also been known to actually break heaters, filter intakes, under-gravel filter stems, and floating thermometers. Sometimes the wreckage is from an accident, other times it&#039;s on purpose as the Oscar was using that floating thermometer as a toy. If you want to give your Oscars a toy to play with, occasionally throw a clean ping-pong ball into the tank and enjoy the show.

[/code]
Oscars are the beginner&#039;s species of New World Cichlids and an introduction to the more aggressive species, but despite their size (average of 14 inches in the aquarium), predatory nature, and the fact that Oscars like to play rough, they are not considered to be an aggressive species themselves, as long as their tank mates are too large to be mistaken for food (an Oscar will eat any fish that can fit its mouth). Oscars mainly show signs of aggression when they are feeding, getting ready to breed, arguing over territory, or when they want some exercise. Unlike the more aggressive Cichlids, Oscars are not known to incessantly bully or terrorize their tank mates for no apparent reason. First-time Oscar owners often panic when they see their first Oscar argument. Expect occasional arguments, that&#039;s what Oscars do; Oscars like to test their tank mates. They may try and bully other fish once in a while, but will not usually persist if the other fish can get out of their way fast enough. In addition to a nip here and a bite there, Oscars will fight and test each others strength by jaw or lip locking and will wrestle and tug on each other, which can sometimes lead to some nasty scrapes and abrasions. Don&#039;t immediately separate Oscars or tank mates when you see aggressive behavior. Observe them for a little while and see how it goes. It should become apparent if it&#039;s a short argument, a change of command, a breeding ritual, or an all out war. MelaFix is an excellent, natural medication that promotes quick tissue regeneration and wound healing and it highly recommended for any Cichlid tank.

If you end up with enough room for some tank mates to keep your Oscar(s) company, be very wary of small Catfish and small Plecos. An Oscar will eat any fish that it can fit in its mouth and Plecos and catfish have sharp, strong barbs that can kill the Oscar that gets one stuck in its mouth or throat. Catfish and Plecos can make great tank mates, but be sure to get them large enough so that an Oscar can&#039;t fit them in it&#039;s mouth. Silver Dollars and various Geophagus species also make great tank mates as they are fairly peaceful and very tough. It&#039;s possible to add other Cichlids as tank mates, but there will be arguments for sure. There have been tanks housing Oscars, Pike, Jack Dempseys, Arowana, Peacock Bass, and Managuense, but it&#039;s hit or miss and only recommended that an experienced hobbyist makes the attempt.

[/code]
[b]Feeding Oscars:[/b]

The first thing that should be noted is that Oscars require vitamin C and will develop health problems in its absence.

Oscars are omnivorous (more accurately, facultative piscivores); They love live foods and enjoy the chase (your live plants won&#039;t). Feeding Oscars live fish can make them more aggressive (some hobbyists like this idea) and most readily available live feeders have little to no nutritional value. Goldfish and Rosy Red minnows should be taken out of the mix completely due to being extremely fatty and rich in a chemical called thiaminase (an enzyme that destroys the essential nutrient thiamine, also known as vitamin B1). In addition to being a catalyst for vitamin deficiency, Goldfish and Rosy Reds also have the ability to introduce some nasty parasites and bacteria into the aquarium which can cause a number of different diseases (Ick and velvet are extremely easily transmitted between feeder fish).

Baby Oscars (until they reach 1 month) should be fed 3 times a day with live, frozen, or freeze-dried: Brine shrimp, blood worms, black worms, tubifex worms, and/or small shreds of frozen krill. Once the Oscars are a little older they should also be given beef heart, white cloud minnows, ghost shrimp, and river shrimp, as well as mealworms and small Cichlid pellets. As the Oscars get more mature (5+ inches), they should be fed 2 times a day with, earthworms, frozen krill, shrimp, medium Cichlid pellets, live crickets, peas, lettuce, pieces of cooked or fresh fish, and minnows. When the Oscars grow even larger (8+ inches), they should be fed 1 to 2 times a day (2 if you give in to their begging or want them to reach full size quickly) with all of the previously mentioned foods in addition to large Cichlid pellets and cooked mussels as well as an occasional small frog, large tadpole, or crayfish. Feed your Oscars a wide variety of the foods listed and they will have all the nutrition they could ever need.

[b]Oscar Health:[/b]

Home aquariums contain insignificant volumes of water compared to an Oscar&#039;s natural environment. In the wild, Oscars rarely encounter excess amounts of ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, and harmful organisms and they are much more resistant to infection due to the relatively low concentration of harmful chemicals and organisms in such a massive volume of water. Although, in a home aquarium, biological waste can pollute the water extremely fast and if left unchecked, water chemistry can become extremely toxic to Oscars and harmful organisms can multiply exponentially and will infect them with disease and serious illness. However, if Oscars are well cared for and their water chemistry is maintained at optimal levels, Oscars can easily resist any effects from harmful organisms in very low or nonexistent concentrations.

Water changes (at least 25%) should be carried out every 2 weeks (or more or less frequently, depending how efficient your aquarium filtration is). Oscars are very hardy fish, but they are also big and messy eaters and eventually they will have health problems if their water chemistry is not maintained; filthy water is usually where &quot;one-eyed&quot; Oscars come from as well as Oscars that have developed HITH (Hole-in-the-Head) disease.

There are a number of different freshwater fish diseases and parasitic infestations out there, but the following two are the most common with Oscars:

Hole-in-the-Head Disease (HITH): Oscars are known to be susceptible to a nasty disease called Hole-in-the-Head; Other common names for this disease are Freshwater Head and Lateral Line Erosion (FHLLE) and Hexamita Disease. Nobody really knows the true cause of this disease, and although it can be fatal, if treated early and properly your Oscar can survive (aside from permanent scarring). Signs of HITH include pitted lesions on the head and lateral line. HITH will be mild at first, but if not treated, pitting will become more intense and secondary bacterial and fungal infections can develop, which will eventually lead to a severe infection and the Oscar will become systemically ill with eventual loss of appetite and life. HITH can be treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole, or a combination of MelaFix and PimaFix can be used.

Ich (Ichthyophthirius multifilis): Also referred to as White Spot, is a burrowing parasitic infestation that causes the skin of the fish to swell and produce white cysts that can be observed as small white spots covering your Oscar to varying degrees. An early symptom (before the spots are visible) is usually when your Oscars continuously scratch themselves on rocks, substrate and driftwood. In the more advanced stages, the Oscar will become lethargic and will eventually develop redness or bloody streaks across its body. Although the infestation itself is similar to a human skin infection, it can be the death of an Oscar with poor nutrition and water conditions. Ich can be treated by first doing a 25 to 50% water change, then raise your aquarium temperature to 86 degrees F, discontinue any carbon filtration, add a normal dose (listed on the box) of freshwater aquarium salt and obverse the situation for 2 weeks. If things don&#039;t clear up, repeat them again and add normal doses of MelaFix and PimaFix as well and observe for another 2 weeks. That should do the trick. One of the best ways to avoid Ich and other parasites is to quarantine new fish in a separate tank for two weeks while performing the full Ich treatment (with MelaFix and PimaFix) before introducing them to your main tank.

[code]
[/code]
One thing that every Oscar owner will have to get used to is that Oscars have a tendency to get cuts and abrasions as well as fin damage once in a while; Either from playing rough with other Oscars or tank mates, or even just bumping into various objects (heaters, driftwood, rocks, filter equipment, etc.) in the tank while chasing food, Oscars seem to always get hurt at some point and it can be quite disturbing for newcomers seeing these injuries for their first time. Although some of these injuries may look rather serious, they are actually superficial wounds and Oscars will quickly heal on their own. Keep their water clean and they will be fine. No medication is necessary, but if you want to help speed up the healing process you can add a normal dose of MelaFix to the tank to speed up the tissue regeneration process.

[b]Oscar Breeding:[/b]

Oscars are monomorphic and it&#039;s almost impossible to sex them (it is impossible to sex young Oscars), but at breeding time you will have a around 4 days to attempt to sex your Oscars; a male&#039;s breeding tube can be observed as being small and pointy where the female&#039;s egg tube is larger and more oval at the end. Unfortunately, two females will sometimes pair off and lay eggs together and several infertile clutches will eventually let you know that you have two females instead of a breeding pair. Unfertilized eggs are milky white while fertilized eggs are tanish to amber.

A breeding pair of Oscars can be conditioned for spawning by feeding them live food such as freshwater shrimp, minnows, frogs and crayfish. A pair of Oscars will usually test each other with a jaw/lip-locking, breeding ritual and once they both pass, they may chase each other around for a little while and then they will begin cleaning off rocks in the aquarium. At this time it&#039;s recommended to provide them with a large slab of slate where the female can lay her eggs as Oscars will not lay eggs on substrate. Once the Oscars clean off the area, the female will lay her eggs (up to 1000) and the male will fertilize them. While Oscars are breeding, they are extremely protective of their area and no other fish will be allowed near it.

The eggs will hatch in 3 to 5 days and the fry will look like a wiggling mass with tails, attached to the slate; as they start to absorb their yolk sacs, they will eventually fall to the substrate in a sticky blob. Once the fry are done with their yolk sacs (around 4 days), they will begin swimming on their own and will be ready to consume gargantuan quantities of baby brine shrimp (their water will need to be changed often). Because Oscars will care for their eggs and practice brood care for their newly hatched fry, it is safe to leave the fry with their parents for about a month, after which they should be relocated to another tank. Some breeders will move the slate and attached eggs to a different tank (using the same water) after they are fertilized, for fear of the parents may eat them. If the slate is relocated into another tank, the eggs will hatch on their own, but beware of Oscar attacks while trying to remove their eggs.

[b]In conclusion:[/b]

Oscars can be a lot of fun and are a great introduction to predatory fishkeeping. They are truly a species that will bring a lot of personality and activity to any freshwater Cichlid aquarium. Remember to keep their water clean and they will thrive and offer years of enjoyment and excitement for the beginner to intermediate hobbyist. Water Dogs! A crash course in keeping Oscar Cichlids

Astronotus ocellatus, also known as the Oscar, is a fresh water species which is a member of the Cichlid family. Wild Oscars are native to the Amazon River basin (as well as the Orinoco and Paraguay basins) in South America. In their natural environment Oscars are typically found in slow moving, whitewater to blackwater environments and can be found taking cover around and within submerged trees, roots, rocks, vegetation and driftwood.

Oscars are one of the hardiest and most popular Cichlids in the hobby and they can learn to distinguish their owner(s) from strangers as well as associate them with food. Oscars are very intelligent and will develop and display unique and interesting personalities. In addition to their constant "begging" for food, Oscars can also be trained to eat from their owner's hand; which is why they are sometimes referred to as river or water dogs.

[b]Choosing your Oscar:[/b]

The original species of Astronotus ocellatus is the Wild Oscar (also referred to as the Common Oscar); the Wild Oscar is the only Oscar that can be found in it's natural habitat in the wild (aside from various "pets" that have been released in ponds, lakes, canals, and rivers within sub-tropical or tropical environments). All other varieties of the Oscar have been bred exclusively for the aquarium trade, including varieties with red marbling, albino, leucistic, and xanthistic. Red Oscars, Tiger Oscars, Red Tiger Oscars, Red Lutino Oscars, Lemon Oscars, Platinum Oscars, Gold Oscars, Copper Oscars, Albino Tiger Oscars, Albino Red Oscars... the list goes on. There are also veil-tail (long-finned) versions of all the various forms in the aquarium trade, but it's not recommended that they be kept with other Oscars or aggressive Cichlids; as their fins are delicate and are prone to damage, which can cause various fin diseases or infections.

When choosing an Oscar, make sure to examine it closely before you decide to purchase it. Keep an eye out for the ones that are very alert and active. Don't choose one that is acting completely different from the rest, seems to be lethargic or just happens to be lying on the bottom of the tank pouting or possibly not feeling too well. A healthy Oscar is always alert and looking for food.

If you plan to purchase a mature Oscar, keep an eye out for any pitting or holes that may have devleoped on it's head; It's a sure sign of Hole in the Head Disease.

Also make sure your future pet Oscar does not have any small white spots (similar to tiny grains of salt) on it as it's a sure sign that it has been infected by Ick (an Ichthyophthirius multifilis parasite).

[b]So, you brought home a new Oscar for your tank...[/b]

The water chemistry at a fish store is usually fairly neutral at a pH of around 7.0 and the GH and KH can very greatly, not to mention that it can also contain various nasty parasites. When introducing a new Oscar to a tank, you can't go wrong with the "drip" method as even baby Oscars have been known to tear little holes in the store bags and nobody wants fish store water in their tanks.

Carefully empty the contents of the bag (including the water) into a container. Take some airline tubing and set up a siphon drip line from the target aquarium to the container with your new Oscar. If you don't have an airline control valve handy, you can tie a couple loose knots in the airline to control the rate of water flow (it's also recommended that you secure the airline tubing in place with an airline holder or some other method). Start a siphon by sucking on the end of the airline tubing you'll be placing into the container. When water begins flowing through the tubing, it's time to adjust the drip (either by adjusting the control valve or tightening one or both of the knots) to a rate of 2-4 drips per second. When the amount of water in the bucket doubles, empty half of it and start the drip again until the volume doubles again. Repeat this process for about one hour and then your new Oscar is ready to be netted and moved to your target aquarium.

New Oscars will often pout. If your new Oscar swims to the bottom of the tank and lays on one side, looking up at you with an untrusting eye, don't panic, it may just be a little stressed and will soon get over it and snap into action, exploring its new home. Current, resident Oscars consider new Oscars a threat as well as intruders in their territory. The bigger the Oscars are, the bigger the fight can be. They will sort things out, but there maybe be a few bruises and hurt feelings in the process.

[b]In the Aquarium:[/b]

Oscars are excellent for breaking in a beginning Cichlid hobbyist as they are a very hardy species and their owner(s) will learn a lot about the care and habits of predatory fish, water conditions, filtration and how much fun it can be to have a Cichlid tank. Oscars can live for 12 to 16 years and it's important to understand that Oscars are a long-term commitment.

In their natural environment, Oscars can be found in acidic blackwater conditions as well as neutral whitewater conditions with a pH anywhere from 4.5 to 7.5. In an aquarium environment, Oscars will thrive in conditions with a pH ranging from 5.0 to 7.0 and a temperature between 74 degrees F to 84 degrees F; When it comes to water hardness, the GH should be around 3 to 7 and the KH ranging from 2 to 4.

Oscars are one of the fastest growing aquarium fish in the hobby and baby Oscars are usually sold at the fish store at around one to two inches long. Those babies will easily gain one inch a month for the first eight months. Expect those babies to be seven or eight inches by the time they are a year old. Ideally, a single Oscar should be kept in a tank that is no less than 75 gallons and a 110-125 gallon tank is recommended for two. Oscars are greedy, big and messy eaters and produce a considerable biological load within their environment. Therefore, the two most vital components for Oscars are tank size and filtration; a large tank with an efficient amount of quality filtration will play a vital role in keeping your Oscar(s) happy and healthy.

Oscars love to decorate and will rearrange their environment to their liking by digging large pits within the substrate and relocating rocks and other objects (including submersed heaters and thermometers). Oscars are very powerful fish and can and will move almost anything in the tank aside from large pieces of driftwood. As far as live plants go, Amazon and various Swords are recommended as they will grow powerful root structures and may be too difficult to move. Most other live plants will either be uprooted or shredded. Oscars have also been known to actually break heaters, filter intakes, under-gravel filter stems, and floating thermometers. Sometimes the wreckage is from an accident, other times it's on purpose as the Oscar was using that floating thermometer as a toy. If you want to give your Oscars a toy to play with, occasionally throw a clean ping-pong ball into the tank and enjoy the show.

[code]
[/code]
Oscars are the beginner's species of New World Cichlids and an introduction to the more aggressive species, but despite their size (average of 14 inches in the aquarium), predatory nature, and the fact that Oscars like to play rough, they are not considered to be an aggressive species themselves, as long as their tank mates are too large to be mistaken for food (an Oscar will eat any fish that can fit its mouth). Oscars mainly show signs of aggression when they are feeding, getting ready to breed, arguing over territory, or when they want some exercise. Unlike the more aggressive Cichlids, Oscars are not known to incessantly bully or terrorize their tank mates for no apparent reason. First-time Oscar owners often panic when they see their first Oscar argument. Expect occasional arguments, that's what Oscars do; Oscars like to test their tank mates. They may try and bully other fish once in a while, but will not usually persist if the other fish can get out of their way fast enough. In addition to a nip here and a bite there, Oscars will fight and test each others strength by jaw or lip locking and will wrestle and tug on each other, which can sometimes lead to some nasty scrapes and abrasions. Don't immediately separate Oscars or tank mates when you see aggressive behavior. Observe them for a little while and see how it goes. It should become apparent if it's a short argument, a change of command, a breeding ritual, or an all out war. MelaFix is an excellent, natural medication that promotes quick tissue regeneration and wound healing and it highly recommended for any Cichlid tank.

If you end up with enough room for some tank mates to keep your Oscar(s) company, be very wary of small Catfish and small Plecos. An Oscar will eat any fish that it can fit in its mouth and Plecos and catfish have sharp, strong barbs that can kill the Oscar that gets one stuck in its mouth or throat. Catfish and Plecos can make great tank mates, but be sure to get them large enough so that an Oscar can't fit them in it's mouth. Silver Dollars and various Geophagus species also make great tank mates as they are fairly peaceful and very tough. It's possible to add other Cichlids as tank mates, but there will be arguments for sure. There have been tanks housing Oscars, Pike, Jack Dempseys, Arowana, Peacock Bass, and Managuense, but it's hit or miss and only recommended that an experienced hobbyist makes the attempt.

[/code]
[b]Feeding Oscars:[/b]

The first thing that should be noted is that Oscars require vitamin C and will develop health problems in its absence.

Oscars are omnivorous (more accurately, facultative piscivores); They love live foods and enjoy the chase (your live plants won't). Feeding Oscars live fish can make them more aggressive (some hobbyists like this idea) and most readily available live feeders have little to no nutritional value. Goldfish and Rosy Red minnows should be taken out of the mix completely due to being extremely fatty and rich in a chemical called thiaminase (an enzyme that destroys the essential nutrient thiamine, also known as vitamin B1). In addition to being a catalyst for vitamin deficiency, Goldfish and Rosy Reds also have the ability to introduce some nasty parasites and bacteria into the aquarium which can cause a number of different diseases (Ick and velvet are extremely easily transmitted between feeder fish).

Baby Oscars (until they reach 1 month) should be fed 3 times a day with live, frozen, or freeze-dried: Brine shrimp, blood worms, black worms, tubifex worms, and/or small shreds of frozen krill. Once the Oscars are a little older they should also be given beef heart, white cloud minnows, ghost shrimp, and river shrimp, as well as mealworms and small Cichlid pellets. As the Oscars get more mature (5+ inches), they should be fed 2 times a day with, earthworms, frozen krill, shrimp, medium Cichlid pellets, live crickets, peas, lettuce, pieces of cooked or fresh fish, and minnows. When the Oscars grow even larger (8+ inches), they should be fed 1 to 2 times a day (2 if you give in to their begging or want them to reach full size quickly) with all of the previously mentioned foods in addition to large Cichlid pellets and cooked mussels as well as an occasional small frog, large tadpole, or crayfish. Feed your Oscars a wide variety of the foods listed and they will have all the nutrition they could ever need.

[b]Oscar Health:[/b]

Home aquariums contain insignificant volumes of water compared to an Oscar's natural environment. In the wild, Oscars rarely encounter excess amounts of ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, and harmful organisms and they are much more resistant to infection due to the relatively low concentration of harmful chemicals and organisms in such a massive volume of water. Although, in a home aquarium, biological waste can pollute the water extremely fast and if left unchecked, water chemistry can become extremely toxic to Oscars and harmful organisms can multiply exponentially and will infect them with disease and serious illness. However, if Oscars are well cared for and their water chemistry is maintained at optimal levels, Oscars can easily resist any effects from harmful organisms in very low or nonexistent concentrations.

Water changes (at least 25%) should be carried out every 2 weeks (or more or less frequently, depending how efficient your aquarium filtration is). Oscars are very hardy fish, but they are also big and messy eaters and eventually they will have health problems if their water chemistry is not maintained; filthy water is usually where "one-eyed" Oscars come from as well as Oscars that have developed HITH (Hole-in-the-Head) disease.

There are a number of different freshwater fish diseases and parasitic infestations out there, but the following two are the most common with Oscars:

Hole-in-the-Head Disease (HITH): Oscars are known to be susceptible to a nasty disease called Hole-in-the-Head; Other common names for this disease are Freshwater Head and Lateral Line Erosion (FHLLE) and Hexamita Disease. Nobody really knows the true cause of this disease, and although it can be fatal, if treated early and properly your Oscar can survive (aside from permanent scarring). Signs of HITH include pitted lesions on the head and lateral line. HITH will be mild at first, but if not treated, pitting will become more intense and secondary bacterial and fungal infections can develop, which will eventually lead to a severe infection and the Oscar will become systemically ill with eventual loss of appetite and life. HITH can be treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole, or a combination of MelaFix and PimaFix can be used.

Ich (Ichthyophthirius multifilis): Also referred to as White Spot, is a burrowing parasitic infestation that causes the skin of the fish to swell and produce white cysts that can be observed as small white spots covering your Oscar to varying degrees. An early symptom (before the spots are visible) is usually when your Oscars continuously scratch themselves on rocks, substrate and driftwood. In the more advanced stages, the Oscar will become lethargic and will eventually develop redness or bloody streaks across its body. Although the infestation itself is similar to a human skin infection, it can be the death of an Oscar with poor nutrition and water conditions. Ich can be treated by first doing a 25 to 50% water change, then raise your aquarium temperature to 86 degrees F, discontinue any carbon filtration, add a normal dose (listed on the box) of freshwater aquarium salt and obverse the situation for 2 weeks. If things don't clear up, repeat them again and add normal doses of MelaFix and PimaFix as well and observe for another 2 weeks. That should do the trick. One of the best ways to avoid Ich and other parasites is to quarantine new fish in a separate tank for two weeks while performing the full Ich treatment (with MelaFix and PimaFix) before introducing them to your main tank.

[code]
[/code]
One thing that every Oscar owner will have to get used to is that Oscars have a tendency to get cuts and abrasions as well as fin damage once in a while; Either from playing rough with other Oscars or tank mates, or even just bumping into various objects (heaters, driftwood, rocks, filter equipment, etc.) in the tank while chasing food, Oscars seem to always get hurt at some point and it can be quite disturbing for newcomers seeing these injuries for their first time. Although some of these injuries may look rather serious, they are actually superficial wounds and Oscars will quickly heal on their own. Keep their water clean and they will be fine. No medication is necessary, but if you want to help speed up the healing process you can add a normal dose of MelaFix to the tank to speed up the tissue regeneration process.

[b]Oscar Breeding:[/b]

Oscars are monomorphic and it's almost impossible to sex them (it is impossible to sex young Oscars), but at breeding time you will have a around 4 days to attempt to sex your Oscars; a male's breeding tube can be observed as being small and pointy where the female's egg tube is larger and more oval at the end. Unfortunately, two females will sometimes pair off and lay eggs together and several infertile clutches will eventually let you know that you have two females instead of a breeding pair. Unfertilized eggs are milky white while fertilized eggs are tanish to amber.

A breeding pair of Oscars can be conditioned for spawning by feeding them live food such as freshwater shrimp, minnows, frogs and crayfish. A pair of Oscars will usually test each other with a jaw/lip-locking, breeding ritual and once they both pass, they may chase each other around for a little while and then they will begin cleaning off rocks in the aquarium. At this time it's recommended to provide them with a large slab of slate where the female can lay her eggs as Oscars will not lay eggs on substrate. Once the Oscars clean off the area, the female will lay her eggs (up to 1000) and the male will fertilize them. While Oscars are breeding, they are extremely protective of their area and no other fish will be allowed near it.

The eggs will hatch in 3 to 5 days and the fry will look like a wiggling mass with tails, attached to the slate; as they start to absorb their yolk sacs, they will eventually fall to the substrate in a sticky blob. Once the fry are done with their yolk sacs (around 4 days), they will begin swimming on their own and will be ready to consume gargantuan quantities of baby brine shrimp (their water will need to be changed often). Because Oscars will care for their eggs and practice brood care for their newly hatched fry, it is safe to leave the fry with their parents for about a month, after which they should be relocated to another tank. Some breeders will move the slate and attached eggs to a different tank (using the same water) after they are fertilized, for fear of the parents may eat them. If the slate is relocated into another tank, the eggs will hatch on their own, but beware of Oscar attacks while trying to remove their eggs.

9 Complete guide to keeping Neon Tetra in the home aquarium

[b]Where do Neons come from?[/b]

Neon Tetras are native to the streams and small tributaries of the Amazon including areas of southeastern Colombia, northeast Peru and northern and western parts of Brazil. They thrive in blackwater and murky water areas of dense vegetation, including flood plains during the rainy season. Neon Tetras in the wild are found in large schools staying close to the lower areas of the streams and creeks in which they live, close to vegetation and root structures that afford them protection from larger predatory fish species. While it is not necessary to completely recreate their natural environment in the home aquarium, it is important to provide some key aspects of it. If you plan to keep Neon Tetras in your community freshwater aquarium, you should plan to provide areas of lower lighting with either vegetation or root structure to provide them a reasonable comfort level with their environment and a place to escape larger more aggressive species.

[b]Choosing healthy specimens and proper quantities for your aquarium[/b]

When selecting Neon Tetras for your aquarium it is important to choose healthy specimens that will be able to cope well with the transition into their new aquarium environment. Specimens should be active swimmers that swim purposely in the aquarium and do not float or drift in the water as this is a sign of poor health. Healthy specimens will also exhibit bright well defined colors that are not washed out or faded in appearance. General fish selection rules apply as well, in that the store aquarium should be clean, free of any odors and dead fish. Since the Neon Tetra is a very small fish it is a little more suseptible to fluctuations in water chemistry, so it is important to acclimate them slowely to their new environment.

[code]
[/code]
In addition, Neon Tetra are a schooling fish and should absolutely be kept in reasonable sized schools in order for them to thrive in the home aquarium. The size of the school will vary depending on aquarium size, but at least a group of 8 or more specimens should be doable in most all but the smallest aquariums. Larger schools tend to do even better as the numbers provide the Neon Tetra with a good comfort zone and feeling of safety. It is not uncommon to see schools of Neon Tetra as large as 20 to 30 fish in even moderately sized aquariums because of their relatively small size. Last but certainly not least is the sheer beauty of a large school of Neon Tetra with their vibrant color and closely grouped schools, they provide a truly impressive site within the community freshwater aquarium.

[b]Aquarium life[/b]

Neon Tetras are suitable for the beginning aquarium hobbyist, but they do require that the aquarium environment support their basic needs. In the wild, Neon Tetra generally live in water that is cooler as it is well shaded from the sun and somewhat on the acidic side, ranging from a pH of 5.0 to 7.0 and KH or 1.0 to 2.0. However, within the aquarium environment they can be acclimated to tolerate brighter lighting conditions and pH as high as 7.5 if they are brought into these conditions gradually as not to shock the fish. This is best accomplished by emptying the newly bought Neon Tetra into a container with the store bag water and the fish. Then, every 5 minutes a cup full of water can be added to the container for 20 to 30 minutes. This will give the fish time to adjust to both the water chemistry and temperature of the aquarium system. After this acclimation process is complete the fish should be netted and added to the aquarium and the water in the acclimating container should be discarded.

[code]
[/code]
Once in the aquarium, Neon Tetra should be provided plenty of places to hide if threatened; such as, live or fake plants, drift wood or root structures or large rocks. Due to their size and overall very passive nature, Neon Tetra should only be kept with other peaceful community species that will not grow large enough to eat them. While they reach just over an inch in size when fully grown, they do form tight schools that help give them protection from other larger fish species, so it is strongly recommended that this species be kept in good sized groups which will benefit their overall health and security.

[b]Sexing and Breeding[/b]

Female and Male Neon Tetras have very subtle physical differences with the female having a more round body and curvature of the blue line, while the male is more slender and has a straight blue line. The curvature of the blue line in the female is most likely due to the location of the egg sack that even when empty creates a slightly more rounded appearance to the body.

[code]
[/code]
Typically Neon Tetras are bred in conditions that closely mimic their natural surroundings including dim lighting and cooler water temperatures of around 72 to 75 degrees fahrenheit or 24 degrees celsius. The breeding aquarium should also have live plants that provide areas of the aquarium with high levels of shade and provide the fish a location to deposit their eggs. Breeders will often try to induce mating by lowering the KH to 1.0 or by letting nitrate levels rise and then replace 50% of the water with fresh RO/DI water along with brighter lighting to simulate the rainy season.

Once the eggs have been laid it is important to remove the adults as they will often eat young fry. The young are sensitive to higher lighting levels, so the lights should be maintained a low level and other water parameters should remain stable and constant. Eggs typically hatch within 24 hours and fry will reach their adult coloration within 30 days. During this time they can be fed a diet of rotifers, egg yolk, baby brine shrimp or other prepared foods formulated for newly hatched fish.

[b]In conclusion[/b]

Overall the Neon Tetra is a hardy small fish species that brings a lot of color and activity to peaceful freshwater community aquariums. With a reasonable amount of care, a beginner aquarium hobbyist can not only maintain this species, but create an environment in which they can thrive.

Due to their size and overall very passive nature, Neon Tetra should only be kept with other peaceful community species that will not grow large enough to eat them. While they reach just over an inch in size when fully grown, they do form tight schools that help give them protection from other larger fish species, so it is strongly recommended that this species be kept in good sized groups which will benefit their overall health and security.

[b]Sexing and Breeding[/b]

Female and Male Neon Tetras have very subtle physical differences with the female having a more round body and curvature of the blue line, while the male is more slender and has a straight blue line. The curvature of the blue line in the female is most likely due to the location of the egg sack that even when empty creates a slightly more rounded appearance to the body.

[code]
[/code]
Typically Neon Tetras are bred in conditions that closely mimic their natural surroundings including dim lighting and cooler water temperatures of around 72 to 75 degrees fahrenheit or 24 degrees celsius. The breeding aquarium should also have live plants that provide areas of the aquarium with high levels of shade and provide the fish a location to deposit their eggs. Breeders will often try to induce mating by lowering the KH to 1.0 or by letting nitrate levels rise and then replace 50% of the water with fresh RO/DI water along with brighter lighting to simulate the rainy season.

Once the eggs have been laid it is important to remove the adults as they will often eat young fry. The young are sensitive to higher lighting levels, so the lights should be maintained a low level and other water parameters should remain stable and constant. Eggs typically hatch within 24 hours and fry will reach their adult coloration within 30 days. During this time they can be fed a diet of rotifers, egg yolk, baby brine shrimp or other prepared foods formulated for newly hatched fish.

[/code]
[b]In conclusion[/b]

Overall the Neon Tetra is a hardy small fish species that brings a lot of color and activity to peaceful freshwater community aquariums. With a reasonable amount of care, a beginner aquarium hobbyist can not only maintain this species, but create an environment in which they can thrive.

[color=#bed8f8][b]What is a canister filter?[/b][/color]

Like most common forms of aquarium filtration, a canister filter provides chemical, biological and physical filtration by removing water from the aquarium via an intake tube, passing the aquarium water over a series of filtration media housed within a pressurized canister, and they returning the filtered water to the aquarium via a spray bar or spray nozzle. The unique form factor of the canister filter allows for a lot of flexibility in terms of where the filter is located. Since flexible tubing is used for both the intake and return, a canister filter can be located underneath, behind or off to the side of the aquarium, with the length of the tubing and the strength of the return pump within the canister filter being the only real limiting factors.

[code]
[/code]
The sealed and pressurized design of the canister filter also allows for very quiet operation, as the noise associated with water overflowing from the fish tank or flowing from one chamber to another as in a non-sealed aquarium filter design are kept to an absolute minimum. Being a sealed design, the canister filter can also be disconnected from the intake / return tubing and carried away for maintenance and cleaning. This design allows the hobbyist the flexibility of maintaining and cleaning the filter in a location better suited for the activity and not being forced to work underneath the aquarium or in other less than desirable locations.

[color=#bed8f8][b]How do canister filters work?[/b][/color]

Canister filters work by drawing water from the aquarium via a lift tube and through plastic tubing into the externally located canister filter. This is done via a pump that is typically located in the bottom of the canister filter. The extracted water is forced through a series of filter media layers located within the pressurized canister filter. While the exact flow of the water through the filter media can vary by models and brands of canister filters, a typical scenario has the water first passing through media designed to remove physical particles from the water, then through biological filter media and lastly through media designed for chemical filtration, before being returned to the aquarium back through plastic tubing connected to either a nozzle or spray bar.

[color=#bed8f8][b]How well do they work compared to other aquarium filtration techniques?[/b][/color]

There are a number of different filter types available within the aquarium hobby, and depending on the particular needs of an aquarium setup or the specific requirements of a hobbyist, they all have their niche. This being said, canister filtration is considered to be one of best forms of filtration for a wide variety of aquarium setups ranging from smaller freshwater or marine aquariums like nano cubes, all the way up to very large freshwater aquariums housing large Cichlid species and even larger FOWLR or predator marine fish aquariums. Hobbyists can also use multiple canister filters on the same aquarium, which allows canister filters to scale up and handle even extremely large aquariums (300 gallons plus) or aquariums with high bio-load species like Peacock Bass or freshwater Stingray.

While canister filtration can be used successfully on marine reef or larger marine fish aquariums, they are probably not the best option overall for these types of setups. Generally these larger saltwater fish or reef aquariums require large wet/dry, sump or refugium based filtration with additional foam fractioning filters like Protein Skimmers in order to provide the necessary level of filtration for complex marine aquarium environments.

[code]
[/code]
Overall though, canister filters do provide high quality filtration, have low power consumption, are cost effective and easy to maintain, which makes them a great choice for most all freshwater community aquarium setups, most all Cichlid aquarium setups, marine nano cubes and moderately sized FOWLR setups and as additional filtration on larger aquarium setups where multiple forms of filtration are required.

[color=#bed8f8][b]What sort of maintenance do canister filters require?[/b][/color]

Canister filters are designed with efficiency, application flexibility and ease of maintenance. The main portions of the filter that require periodic maintenance are contained within the main housing of the filter, where they can be easily transported to a utility sink, outside or other convenient location for cleaning. Aside from clearing algae or debris from the return nozzle or spray bar, the bulk of the maintenance required to keep a canister filter running smoothly and efficiently is centered around the chambers containing the filtration media inside the canister.

[code]
[/code]
Cleaning a canister filter mostly revolves around cleaning or changing the filter pad that captures physical particles from the water and changing out any filter bags containing activated carbon or other chemical media. The biological media (bio balls or ceramic media) typically only needs to be rinsed off from time to time if physical debris is able to build up within the tray containing the bio media. Be sure to use aquarium water or non-chlorinated tap water to rinse off the bio media, this is important in order to not kill off any of the beneficial bacteria living on the media by putting it in contact with the chlorine present in most tap water. Hobbyists should also occasionally pull out all of the media trays and rinse and wipe down the inside of the canister to remove any algae growth or detritus that has built up on the inside of the filter, as this will reduce water flow and ultimately reduce the effectiveness of the filter. 

In terms of how often a canister filter should be cleaned, it varies widely based on the sizing of the canister filter vs. the aquarium size, the fish load, the type of fish and feeding regime; however, it is safe to say that most canister filters will need some attention basic cleaning of the physical filter pad every 1 to 2 months and a more thorough cleaning at least every 4 months. While many hobbyists go longer periods of time; often up to 6 months, their filter are most likely quite dirty and their capability significantly degraded by 6 months of use.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Our opinion on the best uses for canister filters[/b][/color]

So canister filters come in a wide variety of models, designs and capabilities, but is canister filtration the right filtration for your particular tank? 

The short answer is that it depends mostly on the size of your aquarium and your budget. While in theory a canister filter or a combination of multiple canister filters can provide proper filtration for essentially any home aquarium (assuming you don&#039;t have a 2000 gallon home aquarium), it may not always be the best form of filtration or the most cost effective form of filtration.

[b]Here are the best uses for canister filtration, listed by the most ideal to least ideal situation:[/b]
[ul]
[li][b]Medium to large sized freshwater fish aquariums:[/b] These are aquariums that are generally between 30 to 300 gallons in size and contain Freshwater community, New World Cichlid or African Cichlid fish species.[/li]
[li][b]Larger New World Cichlid or African Cichlid freshwater fish aquariums:[/b] These are larger aquariums 125 to 450 gallons in size where multiple high-end canister filters can be combined to handle the substantial filtration requirements of larger Cichlid species.[/li]
[li][b]Smaller freshwater fish aquariums:[/b] These are freshwater fish or planted aquariums that typically range between 10 to 30 gallons in size. While these can be adequately filtered via power filters or even internal filters, a small canister filter will also do an excellent job at a slightly higher upfront cost.[/li]
[li][b]Smaller to medium sized marine fish aquariums:[/b] These are generally fish-only or FOWLR (fish only with live rock) aquariums ranging from 20 to 125 gallons in size. While a canister filter is not the ideal form of filtration for a marine aquarium, when combined with a hang-on protein skimmer it can provide excellent filtration for marine aquariums setups housing primarily fish.[/li]
[/ul]

[b]Here are the situations where a canister filter is either a poor choice or won&#039;t work well at all:[/b]
[ul]
[li][b]Coral reef aquariums:[/b] These are marine aquariums supporting a variety of Corals, invertebrates and fishes, which essentially require sump based filters, protein skimmers, extra internal water flow via powerheads or wave makers and either refugiums or algae scrubbers to really thrive. While canister filters can provide supplemental filtration in this type of aquarium setup, they are poorly suited to be the main filtration method.[/li]
[li][b]Extra large freshwater or marine aquariums:[/b] These are tanks that exceed 450 gallons and are not well suited for even multiple canister filters. Due to their large scale, these tanks are better suited for larger scale filtration techniques similar to those found in commercial aquaculture, ie. bead filters, tower filters, etc.[/li]
[li][b]Nano aquariums:[/b] These are smaller aquariums (often cube shaped) that are intended for micro environments like mini reefs or freshwater shrimp. Generally this type of setup can be filtered more efficiently and at a lower cost by filtration techniques other than canister filters.[/li]

[b]Maximum Size:[/b] 6&quot;
[b]Minimum Tank Size:[/b] 30 Gallons
[b]Water Conditions:[/b] 75-82Â°F, KH 1-8, pH 5.5-7.0

[b]Origin:[/b]	Amazon, South America
[b]Family:[/b]	Cichlidae
[b]Species:[/b] Angelfish
[b]Aquarium Type:[/b] Community Aquarium

[code]


[/code]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]
The Albino Angelfish is an omnivore and should be fed a variety of foods including vegetables as well as meaty foods. Feed a quality flake food as well as live and frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms and tubfex worms. They are particularly fond of bloodworms and it is even believed that feeding Angelfish bloodworms will help stimulate breeding behavior. Albino Angelfish are an albino strain of the species (Pterophyllum sp.) of Anglefish, whose coloration ranges from a white and silver coloration to a yellowish orange coloration with pink eyes. The Albino Angel hails from the warm temperate waters of the Amazon basin in South America, where it is found in calm waterways and flood plains. Albino Angels are found living in areas with losts of plants or tree roots, which they use for protection against larger fish species and as a place to hunt insect larvae and other foodstuffs. 

These days this species is more commonly tank bred in the United States and parts of Southern Asia, than collected from the wild. They have long been sought after in the aquarium hobby because of their brilliant black body coloration and long flowing fins. Their long fins mean that they should not be kept with fish species that will nip or tear their fins. Many so called fin nipping species can be kept easily with angelfish as long as the fin nippers are kept in groups of 4 or more, so that they will nip at each other and ignore the angelfish. In a small or medium sized aquarium the Albino Angel is best kept in a mated pair, in larger aquariums they can be kept in groups of 6 or more individuals.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Albino Angelfish will do well in aquariums that are 30 gallons or larger and have plenty of plants and/or driftwood. As a group freshwater Angelfish are territorial and will squabble with one another until a dominant male is established. They can be kept singularly, in mated pairs or in medium sized groups of 6 or more. Contrary to popular belief, long finned species like the Albino Angelfish can be kept with barbs and other fin nipping species. The key here is that the barbs be kept in proper sized groups, so that they nip at each other instead of nipping at the Angelfish or other species that are not equipped for this type of behavior. Barbs prefer to be kept in groups and their nipping at each other is normal behavior that will not hurt them at all; however, this behavior is too boisterous for many other fish species and damaging to long finned fish species. 

Angelfish in general require fairly constant water parameters and are less forgiving than many other freshwater community species towards fluctuations in pH or temperature. Like with most South American cichlid species, the Albino Angelfish prefers soft, slightly acidic water with temperatures that stay between 79 and 83 degrees.

[code]


[/code]
[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Aequidens pulcher, also known as the Blue Acara, is a very attractive and hardy species that originates within still to slow moving waters in Central and South America. 

Blue Acara are often confused with their more aggressive relative, the Green Terror (Aequidens rivulatus). They have a tannish base color with vertical, dark striping on the body. The most beautiful and distinctive feature of the Blue Acara is the electric, blue-green, iridescent markings over their operculums (gill covers). 

They have metallic, gold-green hued scales on their flanks that become translucent at their fins. Their caudal and dorsal fins end with an orange outline. A male Blue Acara will have more elongated dorsal and anal fins than a female.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Blue Acara require an aquarium of at least 45 gallons and should be provided with a fine substrate and multiple places where they can find shelter (driftwood, rock structures, or dense vegetation). 

While they appreciate the pressence of live plants in the aquarium, they have been known to dig while breeding and can cause some uprooting. Although they are generally considered to be a peaceful species and have been successfully kept in Community aquariums, the Blue Acara can show aggression; even more so during breeding. 

Blue Acaras will bully small fish and eat the tiny ones, therefore, tank mates should be considered carefully and should be comparable in size. 

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Blue Acara is an omnivore and should be fed a variety of foods, such as frozen or freeze-dried brine shrimp, bloodworms, blackworms, flake food, and Cichlid pellets. 

They relish live food and should occasionally be provided with live brine shrimp, guppies, minnows, shrimp, worms, and crickets.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Blue Acara are dimorphic, egg layers that practice brood care. To induce breeding and sustain the ideal breeding environment, the water temperature should be raised to and maintained at about 86Â°Â F. 

The female Blue Acara will lay from 150-250 eggs in a carefully cleaned and selected location (driftwood, rocks, stones, slate, large plant leaves, etc). The eggs will hatch in 2-3 days and the fry should be swimming around within a week. A pair of Blue Acara will continue to breed every two weeks if the fry are constantly removed shortly after they hatch. 

The newly hatched fry can be fed a diet of baby brine shrimp and then moved to other foods as they mature. [color=#bed8f8][b]Blue Acara[/b][/color]

[code]


[/code]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

Pseudotropheus Acei are typically found on the Northwestern areas of Lake Malawi in Zambia, Africa. Their bright blue and yellow coloration and interesting banded markings on both their fins and body have made them a long time favorite of African Cichlid enthusiasts. Pseudotropheus Acei tends to become highly aggressive towards the same species when they do not have sufficient space to claim a suitable territory, but are otherwise considered to be fairly peaceful. 

However, many hobbyists have great success with crowding African Cichlids, which means that no one individual can establish their own territory. This essentially creates a balance within the aquarium and spreads any aggression from dominant specimens amongst many tank mates, which keeps any one fish from being stressed to death. Overall there is little to differentiate a male Acei Cichlid from a female, other than the males bearing egg spots on the back edge of the anal fin. 

Overall the Pseudotropheus Acei is a popular species and definitely worth a chance for beginners and advanced hobbyists alike. They are generally easy to find at local and online retailers and sell for very reasonable prices.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Pseudotropheus Acei will do best when housed in an aquarium of 75 gallons or more, and are provided with a fine sand substrate, multiple rocky formations or along with moderate water flow and small amounts of vegitation, that will simulate their natural environment. 

They prefer open space and should be provided with enough room to swim around freely. They should be fine with live plants, but have been known to eat them sometimes in their diet. Pseudotropheus Acei are normally fine with tank mates that do not share their appearance or species, but they should be similar in size and disposition. 

A larger tank, 6 foot long or more, will be needed if another male Pseudotropheus Acei is ever planned as a new addition, unless the tank is crowded with specimens and no one dominant male is able to establish his own territory.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Acei Cichlid are herbivores who in their native habitat feed primarily on algae covered rocks and submerged wood. They are also known to graze on multiple types of aquatic vegitation, thus making them not as well suited as most African Cichlids for a planted aquarium environment. However, they should be fine with tougher plants like Java Ferns or many Anubias plant species. 

Hobbyists typically provide Acei Cichlids with a quality herbivore flake or pellet food, along with supplemental algae wafers and of course naturally occuring algae growth on the rock and wood aquarium decor.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

For hobbyists looking to breed Acei Cichlid, they will more quickly facilitate spawning by keeping a single male specimen with at least three females. Pseudotropheus Acei are maternal mouthbrooders, with the female cichlid laying her eggs and immediately gathering them up in her mouth. 

The female will then be attracted to the egg-like spots on the males anal fin, thinking that they are more eggs to gather up in her mouth; she will then try to gather and will receive sperm from the male, thus fertilizing the eggs. The female will carry the eggs (usually a clutch of 25-50) for around 25 days before she releases free-swimming fry. The fry can then be fed newly hatched brine shrimp, Artemia nauplii, daphnia, or crushed flake food. [color=#bed8f8][b]Acei Cichlid[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

The African Water Fern, sometimes referred to as the Congo Fern, is a true aquatic plant species that can be found submerged in various lakes, rivers, and streams of tropical South Africa. Its elegant leaves can range from bright to dark green in color and provide an attractive contrast to other aquarium plants. 

African Water Ferns are considered to be a slow-growing species, but once it&#039;s acclimated and has been established for a few months, its rate of growth can increase dramatically (which can also be enhanced by stronger lighting). The African Water Fern is easy to care for and can thrive in low light conditions; making it a great choice for beginners.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

The African Water Fern will fair well with a low-light intensity of 1 watt per gallon from full spectrum (5000-7000K) bulbs, but can also handle medium to high intensity (and may grow more quickly). Although this species has no special nutrient or CO2 requirements, a nutrient-rich substrate, vitamin supplementation, and mild CO2 injection would greatly increase its rate of growth. 

A well established African Water Fern can make an ideal focus point in an aquarium or multiple specimens can be used in the background or rear corners of the aquarium to provide contrast with other species and additional shelter for tank inhabitants. The rhizome of this species should not be buried in the substrate, but should be utilized in a method similar to Java Fern and various Anubias species; simply attach the rhizome to a piece of driftwood or rock using some thread or fishing line and the plant will eventually become attached by small anchoring roots in the driftwood, rock, or substrate. 

This species is great for slightly soft, acidic water as well as the slightly harder, more alkaline conditions associated with African cichlid environments. The African Water fern also appreciates being located in an area of the aquarium with a current or decent amount of water movement.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Propagation Information[/b][/color]

Propagation of the African Water Fern is relatively easy and is done by dividing the plant at the rhizome (root) with very sharp, sterilized scissors and placing the &quot;new&quot; specimen in the desired location. The new plants obtained from propagation make excellent, bright green accent plants, while the larger, more mature specimens will take on a dark green coloration. 

For maintenance the leaves can be pruned by clipping the frond at the base of the rhizome, which will keep the plant in check as well as proportional to the desired aquascape of the aquarium. [color=#bed8f8][b]African Water Fern [/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

The African Water Fern, sometimes referred to as the Congo Fern, is a true aquatic plant species that can be found submerged in various lakes, rivers, and streams of tropical South Africa. Its elegant leaves can range from bright to dark green in color and provide an attractive contrast to other aquarium plants. 

African Water Ferns are considered to be a slow-growing species, but once it's acclimated and has been established for a few months, its rate of growth can increase dramatically (which can also be enhanced by stronger lighting). The African Water Fern is easy to care for and can thrive in low light conditions; making it a great choice for beginners.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

The African Water Fern will fair well with a low-light intensity of 1 watt per gallon from full spectrum (5000-7000K) bulbs, but can also handle medium to high intensity (and may grow more quickly). Although this species has no special nutrient or CO2 requirements, a nutrient-rich substrate, vitamin supplementation, and mild CO2 injection would greatly increase its rate of growth. 

A well established African Water Fern can make an ideal focus point in an aquarium or multiple specimens can be used in the background or rear corners of the aquarium to provide contrast with other species and additional shelter for tank inhabitants. The rhizome of this species should not be buried in the substrate, but should be utilized in a method similar to Java Fern and various Anubias species; simply attach the rhizome to a piece of driftwood or rock using some thread or fishing line and the plant will eventually become attached by small anchoring roots in the driftwood, rock, or substrate. 

This species is great for slightly soft, acidic water as well as the slightly harder, more alkaline conditions associated with African cichlid environments. The African Water fern also appreciates being located in an area of the aquarium with a current or decent amount of water movement.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Propagation Information[/b][/color]

Propagation of the African Water Fern is relatively easy and is done by dividing the plant at the rhizome (root) with very sharp, sterilized scissors and placing the "new" specimen in the desired location. The new plants obtained from propagation make excellent, bright green accent plants, while the larger, more mature specimens will take on a dark green coloration. 

For maintenance the leaves can be pruned by clipping the frond at the base of the rhizome, which will keep the plant in check as well as proportional to the desired aquascape of the aquarium.

The Banded Shark is also commonly known as a Cat Shark because the barbells at the mouth look like cat whiskers, it is also referred to as the Brown Banded Bamboo Shark. The Banded Shark is a very popular shark species for aquarium hobbyists as it does not attain as large a size as post other shark species and it has a moderate temperament, which allows it to be kept with a variety of similarly sized fish. 

While this species can be kept with many different fish species, it will eat any crustacean that it comes across. As will other bottom dwelling shark species, the Banded Shark should only be kept with a soft substrate; such as, sand so as not to scratch or irritate its abdomen.

Banded Sharks can vary in color from black and tan bands to brown and tan bands. While this species does have a shark look, it is a little less shark like in appearance than Horn, Nurse and Leopard sharks. The dorsal fin it set a ways back on the body which along with its narrow body gives this species a long slender look. There may be large, muted brown spots between the stripes when the fish gets larger.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

The Banded Shark is a bottom dwelling shark that is common in the home aquarium because of its relatively small size (40&quot;) and moderate temperament. It will eat any crustacean or mollusk present in the aquarium and may eat small fish. The Banded Shark stays relatively small, but requires at least a 180 gallon or larger aquarium as an adult. 

While most shark species require an aquarium that is at least as wide as the shark is long, the Banded Shark does not have this requirement as its body is very slender and flexible. Unlike many shark species, the Banded Shark can be kept easily with other hardy species ranging from Tangs and Angelfish to Groupers. It requires sand as the substrate as the abdomen is easily scratched by a coarser substrate, which may lead to an infection. It should never be exposed to copper-based medications.

All sharks including the Brown Banded Bamboo shark have thick bodies and will produce a much higher bio-load than a typical aquarium fish species. It is very important that aquariums housing sharks have excellent biological and mechanical filtration in order to maintain the water quality at a very high level. 

It is also very important to provide a very high level of dissolved oxygen in the water as the majority of tropical reef sharks live in water that is highly oxygenated and will have a very low tolerance for lower dissolved oxygen levels. High quality and highly oxygenated water will help the shark maintain a strong immune system and will greatly increase their lifespan within an aquarium environment.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

When the Banded Shark is first introduced to the aquarium, it may be difficult to feed in the beginning. When first introduced into the aquarium, small pieces of cleaned squid or live saltwater feeder shrimp should be used to entice this fish to eat. Then the Banded Shark should be fed shrimp, scallops or pieces of fresh marine fish. Feeding Banded sharks quality foods such as whole cockle in the shell, fresh shrimp and squid, and frozen mussel are ideal. [color=#bed8f8][b]Banded Bamboo Shark[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

Nandopsis octofasciatum, commonly known as the Jack Dempsey, also has a less common, natural variant which is specifically known as the Electric Blue Jack Dempsey. The Electric Blue Jack Dempsey is an intensely colorful and extremely hardy Cichlid native to still and slow moving bogs, lakes, ponds and swamps in Central America. 

They are one of the most popular species in the hobby and are known for their territorial instincts as well as the intense coloration they can bring to any aquarium. They have a gray-blue base color with vivid, iridescent, electric blue to purplish scales mosaicked with dark to black coloration. Electric Blue Jack Dempsey can also have (to varying intensity) black splotching on their lateral lines. Males will also grow out to be much larger than the females.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Electric Blue Jack Dempsey require an aquarium of at least 55 gallons and should be provided with multiple places where they can find shelter (driftwood, rock structures (especially caves), and dense vegetation). In addition to a good hiding place, Electric Blue Jack Dempsey appreciate clean, acidic to neutral water as well as live plants, but have been known to dig, which will cause some uprooting. 

While they can be quite territorial and aggressive as they grow in size, which can lead to weaker or smaller fish being bullied, they can be kept with a wide range of fish species who have a similar size and temperament. Tank mates should be considered carefully with the size of the aquarium, amount of available territory and long term compatibility based on the adult fish size and temperament taken into consideration.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

As an omnivorous species, the Electric Blue Jack Dempsey should be fed a variety of foods, such as live, frozen or freeze-dried ghost shrimp, minnows, shrimp, crickets, bloodworms, blackworms, earthworms, flake food, and Cichlid pellets.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

The Electric Blue Jack Dempsey is an egg layer, who also practices brood care. For the ideal breeding environment, the water temperature should be raised to and maintained at 84-86Â° F and the pH stablized on the more acidic side. The female Electric Blue Jack Dempsey will lay around 650 eggs in a carefully cleaned location (driftwood, rocks, stones, slate, large plant leaves, etc). 

The eggs will hatch in 2-3 days and the fry should be free-swimming within a week. The newly hatched fry should be fed a diet of baby brine shrimp or crushed flake food and then moved to other foods as they mature. [color=#bed8f8][b]Electric Blue Jack Dempsey[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

The Blue Mushroom Coral (Actinodiscus sp.) is a hardy and easy to maintain species, which is also very colorful and enjoyable to keep. Blue Mushroom Corals are also referred to as Mushroom Anemones, Actinodiscus Mushroom and Disc Anemones. This variety of mushroom coral varies in color from a light blue/green to an emerald green depending on lighting and aquarium conditions. They will also fluoresce when kept under actinic lighting. Blue Mushroom Corals are a wonderful invertebrate for bottom placement in a reef aquarium, which over time will reproduce forming a carpet covering the rock work and nearby sand in a brilliant fluorescent green.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

In general, Blue Mushroom Corals will prosper with only a medium light intensity, and should be placed in the lower areas of an aquarium if kept under high intensity reef lighting. Blue Mushroom Corals require a low to moderate indirect water flow in which to provide supplementary food sources such as photo-plankton and carry away waste products created by the coral. Too direct or too intense a water flow will inhibit the Blue Mushroom Coral from fully expanding and will overtime lead to poor health. Optimum placement for this species is on the bottom of the aquarium in a spot with indirect water flow. Bottom placement will also keep the Blue Mushroom Coral from receiving too intense lighting; as well as, allow it to grow outward. When placing the Blue Mushroom Coral also keep in mind that it is a semi-aggressive species that will require adequate space between itself and other corals or sessile invertebrates (also note that this species will grow out horizontally over time).

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Blue Mushroom Coral receives most of its nutritional requirements through the photosynthesis of the symbiotic algae zooxanthellae, which it hosts. However, it also feeds on other nutrients and particle matter present in established marine aquariums. The Blue Mushroom Coral will also benefit from additional feedings in the form of micro-plankton or other foods designed for filter feeding invertebrates. Each mushroom polyp in the colony is a distinct individual, thus supplemental foods should be gently sprayed over the entire colony to make sure that each polyp has an opportunity to feed.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

The Blood Red Fire Shrimp is also commonly known as Blood Shrimp, Fire Shrimp, or Scarlet Cleaner Shrimp within the aquarium hobby. The Blood Red Fire Shrimp is by far one of the most popular shrimp in the aquarium hobby because of its bright blood-red body with white spots and long white antennae. 

Depending on which region of the Indo-Pacific from which it originates, it may have the white dots just on its carapace, or covering its entire body. This species is not only very attractive, but it also serves the roles of aquarium cleaner and remover of parasites.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

The Blood Red Fire Shrimp requires an aquarium habitat providing it with caves, crevices or overhangs where the lighting is not too intense. While it will tolerate its mate, others of its own kind will be chased away or harassed. 

The Blood Red Fire Shrimp is generally peaceful with most other organisms in the reef system unless they infringe on its territory. As a &quot;cleaner shrimp,&quot; it will set up cleaning stations and remove dead tissue and parasites from fish that present themselves for cleaning. The Blood Red Fire Shrimp is also an excellent scavenger and will move along the reef or substrate bottom looking for any meaty foods. 

As with most all marine invertebrates this species is very intolerant of copper or high levels of nitrates in the aquarium. It is important to provide proper levels of iodine in the water to promote proper molting, which is imperative as this species grows.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Blood Red Fire Shrimp are scavengers and will eat any leftover meaty foods that settle on the reef or aquarium bottom. Their diet should be supplemented with freeze-dried, live or frozen meaty foods or flake foods. 

Depending on the particular aquarium the amount of supplemental food necessary will vary, when feeding the fish it is best to keep an eye on the Blood Red Fire Shrimp to guage how much leftovers it is receiving. [color=#bed8f8][b]Blood Red Fire Shrimp[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Native Habitat and Species Information[/b][/color]

Chaetomorpha sp. is a form of macroalgae that typically grows in long strands that ball up in clumps, where the clump then grows in size as the algae absorbs light and nutrients from the water column. Chaetomorpha Algae has become a favorite amongst reef aquarium keepers for its ability to absorb excess nutrients from the water column and ease of care. 

Chaetomorpha Algae can be placed in sumps or refugiums with moderate water flow and plenty of lighting, here they will absorb phosphates and nitrates from the water column as they continue to grow, then portions of the plant can be harvested or removed from the sump, which will effectively export the excess nutrients they absorbed while growing from the aquarium. 

Its low cost, ease of care and widespread availability has made Chaetomorpha Algae the macroalgae filtration of choice for many marine aquarium hobbyists.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Beyond its nutrient filtering capability, Chaetomorpha Algae grown in the refugium also provides habitat for a wide variety of beneficial organisms like copepods, amphipods, worms and mini starfish. 

Another added benefit of Chaetomorpha Algae over many similar macroalgae is that it does not go through a sexual period like Caulerpa where nutrients are released back into the aquarium water. Utilizing Chaetomorpha Algae for nutrient removal, along with live rock and live sand for de-nitrification and a protein skimming makes for an excellent combination of filtration for marine reef or FOWLR aquariums.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Growth and Feeding[/b][/color]

While Chaetomorpha Algae is easy to grow in most conditions, it will be much more efficient at nutrient export if provided ideal conditions. Ideally Chaetomorpha Algae should be grown in the sump or refugium where it will have low water currents and can be provided plenty of light. 

While Chaetomorpha Algae can survive in lower lighting conditions, it should be provided 75 to 100 watts of 5100K to 6700K floodlight lighting or equivalent fluorescent lighting to thrive. It is important to promote a good growth rate, as the harvested Chaetomorpha Algae is what removes the nutrients from the aquarium ecosystem. 

Faster algae growth will allow for more frequent harvesting, which will in turn increase the filtration benefit of the Chaetomorpha Algae. [color=#bed8f8][b]Chaetomorpha Algae[/b][/color]

Chaetomorpha sp. is a form of macroalgae that typically grows in long strands that ball up in clumps, where the clump then grows in size as the algae absorbs light and nutrients from the water column. Chaetomorpha Algae has become a favorite amongst reef aquarium keepers for its ability to absorb excess nutrients from the water column and ease of care. 

Chaetomorpha Algae can be placed in sumps or refugiums with moderate water flow and plenty of lighting, here they will absorb phosphates and nitrates from the water column as they continue to grow, then portions of the plant can be harvested or removed from the sump, which will effectively export the excess nutrients they absorbed while growing from the aquarium. 

Its low cost, ease of care and widespread availability has made Chaetomorpha Algae the macroalgae filtration of choice for many marine aquarium hobbyists.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Beyond its nutrient filtering capability, Chaetomorpha Algae grown in the refugium also provides habitat for a wide variety of beneficial organisms like copepods, amphipods, worms and mini starfish. 

Another added benefit of Chaetomorpha Algae over many similar macroalgae is that it does not go through a sexual period like Caulerpa where nutrients are released back into the aquarium water. Utilizing Chaetomorpha Algae for nutrient removal, along with live rock and live sand for de-nitrification and a protein skimming makes for an excellent combination of filtration for marine reef or FOWLR aquariums.

Found in the Western Pacific Ocean: Maldives, Sri Lanka, Great Barrier Reef inhabiting heavy coral growths at a wide range of depths between 30 to 100 feet, the Eibl&#039;s Angelfish makes an interesting addition to any heavily aquascaped or reef aquarium. Eibl&#039;s Angelfish can be kept without too many problems in a reef aquariums, however it is more likely to pick on corals and clams than the Coral Beauty or Flame Angel. The Eibl&#039;s Angelfish is recommended for the intermediate to advanced reef aquarist due to it&#039;s need of excellent water conditions and somewhat diverse dietary needs. 

It can be kept with a wide variety of other fishes, with the exception of other pigmy angelfish (unless in a large aquarium 90 gallons plus) or large predators. If you plan to house it with other pygmy angels it is best to add them together to help avoid territorial disputes. It is possible to keep Eibl&#039;s Angelfish in harems of 3-7 individuals, assuming there is adequate space in the aquarium.

The body is a white to greyish cream color with verticle brown/gold stripes, while the tail section is a dark black with a blue accent stripe on the tail fins. There are also yellow to orange highlights above the eye and on the caudual and dorsal fins. Overall the Eibl&#039;s Angelfish has an intricate beauty that while not as immediately flashy as some other species, it&#039;s sharp lines and contrasting colors make it a beautiful species to have.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Like most species and especially pygmy angelfish the Eibl&#039;s Angelfish is territorial towards both other Eibl&#039;s Angelfish and other pygmy angelfish. Extensive rock work, live rock or reef area is required to give the Eibl&#039;s a suitable environment in the aquarium. The Eibl&#039;s will spend most of it&#039;s time swimming in and out of the rock work picking at marine algaes and small coral polyps. 

While the Eibl&#039;s Angelfish is not overly destructive to a reef aquarium, it should be kept with caution as it can nip at corals and polyps and may be damaging to some species of corals. The Eibl&#039;s can easily be kept with other invertebrates such as shrimps &amp; crabs. It is possible in a large aquarium to keep a school of Eibl&#039;s Angels 3-7 members, when kept in these numbers they will form a harem in which one member will remain a male while the other members will be female (it is possible for this species to morph sexually).

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The diet of the Eibl&#039;s Angel should include marine algae, spirulina, high-quality angelfish preparations, and other meaty items such as brine or krill. This species should be fed two to three times daily what the fish will consume within a minute or two. Being an omnivore it is important to provide a balanced diet of algaes and meats to provide all the necessary vitamins and nutritional needs. [color=#bed8f8][b]Eibl's Angelfish[/b][/color]

Like most fish found in the aquarium hobby the Bala Shark goes by a variety of common names including: Tri-Color Shark, Silver Shark and of course the Bala Shark named after its scientific name.  Despite their large adult size, Bala Shark are most commonly kept in standard community aquariums where they will happily coexist with a variety of other community fish species.  

While not aggressive, they can be a problem if kept with very small fish species or if not given enough room to swim, as they are active swimmers.  Adult specimens are also kept with larger, semi-aggressive fish species as they are usually able to hold their own once they have reached adult sizes of 1 foot or more.  

They make a great addition to medium to large aquariums where a small group of them can be kept successfully, swimming about all day providing a lot of activity within the aquarium and providing a bright silver color contrast to other less metallic fish species.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Despite their large adult size, Bala Sharks like to swim in schools both in a natural setting and within an aquarium environment, thus it is best to keep them in small groups of 3 to 6 specimens.  It is important to keep in mind that as adults they can reach approximately 1 1/2 feet in length, so they should only be kept in large to very large aquariums.  Will not particularly aggressive, Bala Sharks can pose a hazard to much smaller fish species like Neon Tetras, as they have been known to eat small fish.  

Bala Sharks prefer aquarium setups that have a good mixture of open swimming areas and dense vegetation or vertically oriented drift wood.  An ideal setup for this species would contain lots of live plants, driftwood and open areas to swim, with a low to moderate current and tank mates that will tolerate the Bala Sharks active nature.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Bala Sharks are omnivores and thus will eat a wide variety of plant based or meaty food preparations.  On top of being an omnivore, Bala Sharks are simply just not picky eaters as they will readily consume a wide variety of foodstuffs including: flaked foods, freeze-dried, vegetable or plant matter, frozen foods, bloodworms, tubifex worms and much more.  It is best to feed them a 2 to 3 times per day amounts that they will consume within a minute or two. [color=#bed8f8][b]Bala Shark[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The Black Veil Angel hails from the warm temperate waters of the Amazon basin in South America, where it is found in calm waterways and flood plains. Black Veil Angels are found living in areas with dense plants and tree roots, which they use for protection against larger fish species and as a place to hunt insect larvae and other foodstuffs. These days this species is more commonly tank bred in the United States and parts of Southern Asia, than collected from the wild. They have long been sought after in the aquarium hobby because of their brilliant black body coloration and long flowing fins. Their long fins mean that they should not be kept with fish species that will nip or tear their fins. Many &quot;fin nipping&quot; species can be kept easily with angelfish as long as the &quot;fin nippers&quot; are kept in groups of 4 or more, so that they will nip at each other and ignore the angelfish. In a small or medium sized aquarium the Black Veil Angel is best kept in a mated pair, in larger aquariums they can be kept in groups of 6 or more individuals.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Black Veil Angelfish will do well in aquariums that are 30 gallons or larger and have plenty of plants and/or driftwood. As a group freshwater Angelfish are territorial and will squabble with one another until a dominant male is established. They can be kept singularly, in mated pairs or in medium sized groups of 6 or more. Contrary to popular belief, long finned species like the Black Veil Angelfish can be kept with barbs and other &quot;fin nipping&quot; species. The key here is that the barbs be kept in proper sized groups, so that they nip at each other instead of nipping at the Angelfish or other species that are not equipped for this type of behavior. Barbs prefer to be kept in groups and their nipping at each other is normal behavior that will not hurt them at all; however, this behavior is too boisterous for many other fish species and damaging to long finned fish species. Angelfish in general require fairly constant water parameters and are less forgiving than many other freshwater community species towards fluctuations in pH or temperature. Like with most South American Cichlid species, the Black Veil Angelfish prefers soft, slightly acidic water with temperatures that stay between 79 and 83 degrees.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Black Veil Angelfish is an omnivore and should be fed a variety of foods including vegetables as well as meaty foods. Feed a quality flake food as well as live and frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms and tubfex worms. They are particularly fond of bloodworms and it is even believed that feeding Angelfish bloodworms will help stimulate breeding behavior. [color=#bed8f8][b]Black Veil Angel[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The male Betta is one of those iconic fish species that is easily recognized to both aquarium hobbyists and non-hobbyists alike.  Their bright coloration, long flowing fins and unique appearance have made them very popular for decades and arguably one of the most popular fish species among aquarium hobbyists.  Bettas originate from shallow waterways, flood plains, rice paddies and streams in many parts of Southeast Asia including: Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and parts of southern China.  

Since Bettas come from shallow water environments, most hobbyists assume that they can stand low water quality and quick changes in environment.  However, the part of the world that Bettas come from has very consistent warm tropical weather and plenty of rainfall to dilute even shallow water and keep the water quality high and temperature stable.  Thus Bettas need an environment with warm water temperatures (75-86Â° F) and fairly stable water conditions.  

Although Bettas are often sold in small bowls in fish stores, for best care, Bettas should be kept singularly in aquariums of at least 1 gallon, with plenty of vegetation to provide them a vegetarian food source and places to hide when they feel threatened.  Bettas are often referred to as Fighting Fish or &quot;Siamese&quot; Fighting Fish, since it has been bred over the years to be both colorful and combative, especially towards other males. As such, only one male Betta should be kept in an aquarium.  The Betta should be housed with peaceful fish that will not nip at the Bettas long flowing fins.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

While Bettas can do well in waters low in dissolved oxygen, that does not mean they require less oxygen than other fish. Bettas have a special respiratory organ that allows them to breath air directly from the surface. In fact they inherently must do so. In experiments where the labyrinth organ was removed, the fish died from suffocation even though the water was saturated with oxygen. For this reason, Bettas must have access to the water surface to breath air directly from the atmosphere.  

Optimal water for keeping healthy Bettas should be soft, warm, with a neutral to slightly acidic pH.  To mimic their natural environment, water movement should be low, or in the case of a larger aquarium, they should be provided calm areas within the tank including calm areas near the surface of the water.  Bettas may be kept in a community tank as long as their water conditions are met, and no aggressive or fin-nipping fish are present.  

However, only one male may be kept in each aquarium, unless they are separated by a barrier.  Bettas will appreciate aquariums with plenty of live plants or synthetic plants made from plastic or silk to provide them a more natural habitat.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

In nature Bettas subsist almost exclusively on eating insects and insect larvae, which is why they have an upturned mouth that is well suited to snatching their insect prey that might fall into the water. Internally their digestive system is geared for meat, having a much shorter alimentary track than vegetarian fish. 

For this reason, live foods are the ideal diet for the Betta, however they will adapt to eating flake foods and frozen and freeze dried foods including: brine shrimp, daphnia, plankton, tubifex, glassworms, and beef heart, are all excellent options that may be found frozen or freeze dried. If flake food is fed, it should be supplemented with frozen and freeze-dried foods, and if possible live foods.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Bettas can be successfully bred by average aquarists using small aquariums of about 10 gallons in size.  Young Betta of approximately 1 years or less in age are ideal for breeding as their fertility and willingness to breed decrease with age.  Typically Betta sold in pets stores are around 6 months in age, so they should be bred within 6 months of purchase.  

Ideally the Betta should be conditioned prior to breeding, by feeding them a diet of live foods, and they should be kept in water with a pH of about 7.0, and temperature around 80 or slightly above.  When he is ready to breed the male will build a bubble nest at the waters surface, where the deposited eggs will be kept until the hatch.  

The female should be provided with a hiding place, as males may become aggressive during courtship. Even with a hiding place, it is common for the female to lose a few scales or have their fins frayed during spawning.

When they are ready to spawn, the pair will display intense coloration and begin circling each other under the bubble nest. The male will wrap himself around the female who has turned on her back. As the female expels the eggs, they are fertilized and begin to sink, at which time the male will scoop up the eggs and spit them into the bubble nest.  

It is best to remove the female after breeding has taken place, as the male will tend to the young and may become aggressive towards the female.  After the young have hatched they will feed off of their yolk sacks for about 36 hours.  The adult male Betta should be removed within 2 days of the young hatching so that they do not eat any of the newly hatched fry. 

The fry should be fed a couple of feedings daily of baby brine shrimp or very fine baby food. Take care not to overfeed, as the uneaten food will foul the water and can quickly prove lethal to the fry. [color=#bed8f8][b]Betta (Male)[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The male Betta is one of those iconic fish species that is easily recognized to both aquarium hobbyists and non-hobbyists alike.  Their bright coloration, long flowing fins and unique appearance have made them very popular for decades and arguably one of the most popular fish species among aquarium hobbyists.  Bettas originate from shallow waterways, flood plains, rice paddies and streams in many parts of Southeast Asia including: Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and parts of southern China.  

Since Bettas come from shallow water environments, most hobbyists assume that they can stand low water quality and quick changes in environment.  However, the part of the world that Bettas come from has very consistent warm tropical weather and plenty of rainfall to dilute even shallow water and keep the water quality high and temperature stable.  Thus Bettas need an environment with warm water temperatures (75-86Â° F) and fairly stable water conditions.  

Although Bettas are often sold in small bowls in fish stores, for best care, Bettas should be kept singularly in aquariums of at least 1 gallon, with plenty of vegetation to provide them a vegetarian food source and places to hide when they feel threatened.  Bettas are often referred to as Fighting Fish or "Siamese" Fighting Fish, since it has been bred over the years to be both colorful and combative, especially towards other males. As such, only one male Betta should be kept in an aquarium.  The Betta should be housed with peaceful fish that will not nip at the Bettas long flowing fins.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

While Bettas can do well in waters low in dissolved oxygen, that does not mean they require less oxygen than other fish. Bettas have a special respiratory organ that allows them to breath air directly from the surface. In fact they inherently must do so. In experiments where the labyrinth organ was removed, the fish died from suffocation even though the water was saturated with oxygen. For this reason, Bettas must have access to the water surface to breath air directly from the atmosphere.  

Optimal water for keeping healthy Bettas should be soft, warm, with a neutral to slightly acidic pH.  To mimic their natural environment, water movement should be low, or in the case of a larger aquarium, they should be provided calm areas within the tank including calm areas near the surface of the water.  Bettas may be kept in a community tank as long as their water conditions are met, and no aggressive or fin-nipping fish are present.  

However, only one male may be kept in each aquarium, unless they are separated by a barrier.  Bettas will appreciate aquariums with plenty of live plants or synthetic plants made from plastic or silk to provide them a more natural habitat.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding & Nutrition[/b][/color]

In nature Bettas subsist almost exclusively on eating insects and insect larvae, which is why they have an upturned mouth that is well suited to snatching their insect prey that might fall into the water. Internally their digestive system is geared for meat, having a much shorter alimentary track than vegetarian fish. 

For this reason, live foods are the ideal diet for the Betta, however they will adapt to eating flake foods and frozen and freeze dried foods including: brine shrimp, daphnia, plankton, tubifex, glassworms, and beef heart, are all excellent options that may be found frozen or freeze dried. If flake food is fed, it should be supplemented with frozen and freeze-dried foods, and if possible live foods.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Bettas can be successfully bred by average aquarists using small aquariums of about 10 gallons in size.  Young Betta of approximately 1 years or less in age are ideal for breeding as their fertility and willingness to breed decrease with age.  Typically Betta sold in pets stores are around 6 months in age, so they should be bred within 6 months of purchase.  

Ideally the Betta should be conditioned prior to breeding, by feeding them a diet of live foods, and they should be kept in water with a pH of about 7.0, and temperature around 80 or slightly above.  When he is ready to breed the male will build a bubble nest at the waters surface, where the deposited eggs will be kept until the hatch.  

The female should be provided with a hiding place, as males may become aggressive during courtship. Even with a hiding place, it is common for the female to lose a few scales or have their fins frayed during spawning.

When they are ready to spawn, the pair will display intense coloration and begin circling each other under the bubble nest. The male will wrap himself around the female who has turned on her back. As the female expels the eggs, they are fertilized and begin to sink, at which time the male will scoop up the eggs and spit them into the bubble nest.  

It is best to remove the female after breeding has taken place, as the male will tend to the young and may become aggressive towards the female.  After the young have hatched they will feed off of their yolk sacks for about 36 hours.  The adult male Betta should be removed within 2 days of the young hatching so that they do not eat any of the newly hatched fry. 

The fry should be fed a couple of feedings daily of baby brine shrimp or very fine baby food. Take care not to overfeed, as the uneaten food will foul the water and can quickly prove lethal to the fry.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Gold Dojo Loaches originate from Southeast Asia, where they can be found in a variety of waterways ranging from tropical rivers to lakes and ponds.  As with all loaches, the Gold Dojo Loach is a bottom dwelling species that spends much of its time foraging along the bottom for food.  Since the lower regions of most lakes, ponds and rivers have low lighting conditions, the Gold Dojo Loach utilizes barbells located around its mouth to find food along the bottom and among plant roots, rocky crevices and caves.  

While they are a carnivorous species, they are generally considered scavengers and will not prey on other aquarium inhabitants with very small shrimps being the only exception.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Gold Dojo Loaches use their narrow long body and barbells to get into tight places in the substrate, underneath the edges of rocks and among plant roots to locate and eat all types of meaty foods that make it to the bottom of the aquarium.  They are sought after within the aquarium hobby for their unique appearance and beneficial scavenging, that helps keep the aquarium free of decaying foodstuffs.  

Gold Dojo Loaches are a very peaceful species that can be safely kept in community aquariums and planted aquariums.  They prefer slightly cooler water temperatures ranging from around 68Â° F to 78Â° F, which is most likely due to the fact that in the wild they live far from the water surface where temperatures are cooler.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Gold Dojo Loaches are a carnivorous species that prefers meaty foods like freeze-dried bloodworms and tubifex worms; as well as, frozen and live meaty foods of all types.  Sinking shrimp pellets or other meaty pellets can also be fed as they will sink to the bottom of the aquarium where the Gold Dojo Loach looks for food. [color=#bed8f8][b]Gold Dojo Loach[/b][/color]

In 2006 the freshwater aquarium hobby was introduced to a beautiful new species of Danio discovered in the ponds and calm waterways of the Salween basin in Burma or modern day Myanmar.  The Celestial Pearl Danio or Galaxy Danio was an immediate hit with aquarists as its brilliant coloration, ease of care and suitability for community or planted aquariums made it an overnight success.  

The coloration of the Celestial Pearl Danio simply cannot be ignored with their light blue body and gold spots, transparent fins with red and black stripes and gold underbelly is simply a beautiful sight, which is even more impressive in schools of 6 to 10 individuals.  Unfortunately their success in the aquarium hobby has put a serious strain on their wild populations as they live in a relatively small area and are being collected for the aquarium hobby faster than they can comfortably re-populate their numbers.  

Fortunately the Celestial Pearl Danio has been successfully bred within the aquarium hobby and many distributors are working on breeding programs to reduce or eliminate the pressure on this species in the wild.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

In the aquarium environment, the Celestial Pearl Danio is an ideal species for any planted or community aquarium as it brings an abundance of color and will get along with other community species well.  Another plus for this species is that they are quite easy to care for as they will tolerate a variety of water temperatures and conditions, although they would prefer a water temperature around 78Â° F with a slightly alkaline pH.  

Celestial Pearl Danio are a small schooling species that should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals with 8 or 10 individuals in the group being ideal.  It is best to replicate a fish species natural environment within the aquarium, and for this species that means having an abundance of vegetation (preferably live plants) with some drift wood and rocks.  

In the wild this species lives in very calm water that is often spring fed or formed from overflows of other waterways, thus they should be kept in aquariums that do not have constant strong direct currents.  Celestial Pearl Danio live in shallow water in the wild that has strong direct sunlight, so they do very well in strongly lit planted aquariums, and will use heavily planted areas in the aquarium or driftwood and rocks to retreat to if they feel threatened.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Celestial Pearl Danio is an omnivore that will eat virtually any standard topical fish foods available within the hobby.  They will readily accept flaked foods, frozen preparations, vegetable or algae flakes and wafers along with freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex worms and brine shrimp.  Essentially they will eat the same foods that would be being fed to the bulk of tropical freshwater species found in a tropical community aquarium. [color=#bed8f8][b]Celestial Pearl Danio[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The Pictus cat is a most popular member of the large Pimelodidae family of catfish that originate from the warm waters throughout South America.  They have been present within the aquarium hobby for decades and proven themselves to build both a very interesting species to keep, but one that does very well within the aquarium environment.  

They have become quite popular due to their bright silver coloration on their bodies combined with black spots and reticulations on their head, body and fins.  Pictus Cats are best kept in small groups of 3 or more specimens in large soft water community aquariums with medium to large sized tank mates or with in New World Cichlid aquariums.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Pictus Cats are considered a community species, as they are very peaceful towards other fish species as long as they are not too small in size (Ex. Neon Tetra).  While the Pictus Cat will not show aggression towards other fish species, it will eat very small fishes like the Neon Tetra.  Pictus Cats are active at night scavenging for food on or near the substrate and will readily consume very small fishes like Neon Tetra while they sleep. Therefore it is important to consider the adult size of 10&quot; and keep this species with other suitably sized fish species.  

Pictus Cats are also very active swimmers that should be provided plenty of swimming room within the aquarium, along with some shaded areas like plants, driftwood or rock caves in which to escape the bright aquarium lighting.  The ideal setup for the Pictus Cat would be a heavily planted soft water aquarium with filtered light creating shaded areas of the aquarium, along with natural caves formed by driftwood or rocks.  

In the wild they prefer to stay in small groups and would due very well in an aquarium of 125 gallons or more in size that could support a small group of 3 or 4 specimens.  Pictus Cats also prefer a sandy substrate and moderate water currents that closely simulate their natural living conditions in forest covered streams throughout South America.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Like most tropical catfish species, the Pictus Catfish is not a picky eater and will readily consume a wide variety of meaty foods.  They will forage about the lower areas of the aquarium looking for any foodstuffs that have made their way to the aquarium substrate.  

Pictus Cats will also feed directly from the water column on a variety of foodstuffs including flake, frozen, pellets and small live foods.  While they make good scavengers, the Pictus Cat should also be fed some sinking pellet type foods to make sure that they receive a complete nutritional diet.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Pictus Catfish are an egg-laying species in which under suitable conditions the female will lay eggs that are then fertilized by the male.  Breeders have found that obtaining the correct environment and conditions to induce breeding in the Pictus Catfish has been very difficult to reproduce, thus this species is considered very difficult to breed in an aquarium setting [color=#bed8f8][b]Pictus Catfish[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The Pictus cat is a most popular member of the large Pimelodidae family of catfish that originate from the warm waters throughout South America.  They have been present within the aquarium hobby for decades and proven themselves to build both a very interesting species to keep, but one that does very well within the aquarium environment.  

They have become quite popular due to their bright silver coloration on their bodies combined with black spots and reticulations on their head, body and fins.  Pictus Cats are best kept in small groups of 3 or more specimens in large soft water community aquariums with medium to large sized tank mates or with in New World Cichlid aquariums.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Pictus Cats are considered a community species, as they are very peaceful towards other fish species as long as they are not too small in size (Ex. Neon Tetra).  While the Pictus Cat will not show aggression towards other fish species, it will eat very small fishes like the Neon Tetra.  Pictus Cats are active at night scavenging for food on or near the substrate and will readily consume very small fishes like Neon Tetra while they sleep. Therefore it is important to consider the adult size of 10" and keep this species with other suitably sized fish species.  

Pictus Cats are also very active swimmers that should be provided plenty of swimming room within the aquarium, along with some shaded areas like plants, driftwood or rock caves in which to escape the bright aquarium lighting.  The ideal setup for the Pictus Cat would be a heavily planted soft water aquarium with filtered light creating shaded areas of the aquarium, along with natural caves formed by driftwood or rocks.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Redtail Sharks have beautiful jet black bodies with vibrant red tail fins.  They are a medium sized tropical community species that is considered semi-aggressive with kept in a medium to large community aquarium, but can often be more aggressive if kept in too small of an aquarium with similarly sized and shaped tank mates.  However, when this species is kept in 55 gallon or larger aquarium with plenty of plants, driftwood and rock-work, it can be an excellent long-lived tank mate. 

In the wild this species live in tropical waterways in and near Thailand where it is used to an environment with an abundance of plants and tree roots.  It is best to emulate their natural habitat as best as possible in the aquarium, as this will help the Redtail Shark feel more at home in the aquarium and allow it to establish a suitable territory within the aquarium.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Redtail Sharks are known as much for their territorial aquarium behavior as their striking coloration and pleasing shark-like body shape.  However, this should not keep a moderately experienced aquarium keeper from keeping the Redtail Shark in a medium to large community aquarium environment.  This species will often claim large territories within the aquarium and will become quite aggressive towards other of its own kind or similarly shaped species like Rainbow Sharks.  

This aggressive nature can be mitigated by providing multiple areas in the aquarium that contain substantial driftwood, plants and rock formations to create various territories within the aquarium.  Medium to Large community aquariums of 90 gallons or more that contain plenty of driftwood, plants and rock formations should be able to support Redtail Sharks and similarly sized and shaped specimens provided the aquarium has lots of aqua-scaping. 

Larger aquariums of 125 gallons or more that are heavily aqua-scaped with plants, driftwood and rock formations can easily support Redtail Sharks with other similar species like Rainbow Sharks.  Redtail Sharks do very well with boisterous species like barbs, tetra and rainbowfish and will generally not bother smaller fish species as long as they are in a suitable aquarium setup.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Redtail Sharks are very easy to feed as they will readily consume a large variety of meaty and plant-based foodstuffs.  They will take food from the waters surface, the water column and even food resting on the aquarium substrate.  It is best to feed this species a varied diet that contains a combination of meaty and vegetable flake and pellet foods, freeze-dried bloodworms and tubifex worms and even vegetable based pellets and wafers.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The Harlequin Rasbora is one of the more popular species of Rasbora found within the aquarium hobby.  They are highly desirable additions to freshwater community aquariums as a group of Harlequin&#039;s have beautiful coloration and markings with a very docile disposition that makes them perfect tank mates for other small or medium sized community species.  

Harlequin&#039;s are easily recognizable due to their rich reddish-copper body and the distinctive black wedge marking on the rear half of their body.  In the wild they will always be found in good sized schools, thus they should also be kept in groups within the aquarium environment as well.  Keeping a group of 8 or more Harlequin Rasbora will make them feel much more safe and comfortable within the aquarium and will show off their markings as the group will have a much more striking appearance than a single individual.  

In the wild Harlequin Rasbora are found living in tropical lowland waterways throughout southeastern Asia.  Their natural habitat is very heavily populated with dense vegetation and maintains tropical temperatures of 73 to 79 F (22 -26 C) throughout the year.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Like most Rasbora species, Harlequin Rasbora are considered an easy species to keep within a community aquarium.  They will do best in setups that resemble their natural habitat and that have consistent water parameters.  Harlequins should be kept in schools of 8 or more individuals in aquariums that have plenty of plants and driftwood along with stable water conditions that include temperatures in the mid to upper 70&#039;s and pH in the range of 6.0 to 6.5.  

They should also be kept with other similarly sized peaceful fish species or with docile medium sized fish species.  If they are kept with more boisterous species like barbs, sharks or angelfish, it is best to provide them a habitat with plenty of plants so that they can retreat to safer areas of the aquarium when they feel threatened or if picked on.  Harlequins themselves will not nip at or bother other fish or invertebrate species and are considered good tank mates for even the most sensitive fish species.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Harlequin Rasbora are very easy to feed as they will readily consume a wide variety of meaty and vegetable based foods.  They will do well with a varied diet consisting of flake foods, small pellets, freeze-dried bloodworms or tubifex worms and other similar preparations.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Harlequin Rasboras are generally considered difficult to breed, but have been breed by advanced aquarists and some professional breeders.  Their willingness to breed is very dependent on their environment and the age of the breeding specimens.  They should be housed in an aquarium with plenty of broad leafed plants with a stable water temperature between 76 and 79 degrees F, along with an acidic soft water with a pH of 6.0 to 6.3.  Within these conditions the aquarist should introduce a small group of 2 or 3 young females (9 to 12 months of age) along with a more mature male (approx. 2 years of age).  

The newly introduced breeding group should be fed live foods while in the breeding aquarium.  Breeding typically takes place in the early morning hours and consists of the male of the species trembling near or rubbing up against the females in order to try and induce them to spawn.  If interested the female will rub her underside against the underside of a broad leaf and encourage the male to join her there to fertilize the eggs.  

The fertilized eggs will adhere to the bottom of the leaf where they will stay until they hatch in about 24 hours.  After the eggs are laid, the parents should be removed from the aquarium and the lights should be kept dim until 24 to 48 hours after the eggs have hatched.  

Like all small fry, the babies should be kept with a small bubble filter that will oxygenate and keep the water filtered, while also keeping the water from stagnating.  The babies should be fed small foods like infusoria and then gradually moved to larger foodstuffs over the course o the next 6 to 8 weeks. [color=#bed8f8][b]Harlequin Rasbora[/b][/color]

Emerald Green Cory Cats bring beauty, interest and functionality to the lower areas of the community aquarium, as they work to scavenge excess foodstuffs and decaying plant matter from the aquarium substrate.  Their efficiency at keeping the substrate clean along with their unique swimming style and attractive looks have made them a popular community species for decades.  

In the wild Emerald Green Cory Cats are found throughout tributaries and flood plains in and around the Amazon river and nearby areas of South America. They are normally found moving along the bottom of the river among the roots and plants savaging for a variety of foods.  Emerald Green Cats are also a very peaceful species that can be kept with any variety of other peaceful freshwater community fish.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Emerald Green Cory Cats should be kept in aquariums that contain ample vegetation, driftwood or root structures, so that the Emerald Green Cory Cat can retreat from the bright aquarium lights when it feels the need. The Emerald Green Cory Cat will search the aquarium substrate for most of its food, but usually will require supplemental feeding via sinking wafers or pellets if not enough excess food is present in the aquarium substrate. 

This species can be kept singularly or in groups of any size, and in the case where they are kept in large enough groups it is not uncommon for specimens to pair off and even mate within a suitably aquascaped aquarium.  While they can be kept singularly, they are a social species that does live in groups in the wild and will be better off in the long term if they are kept in a small group within the aquarium as well.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

In the aquarium environment Emerald Green Cats will readily accept a variety of meaty and vegetable matter foodstuffs including: flake, freeze-dried, frozen, live foods and pellets. This species is an excellent scavenger that will work to keep the aquarium substrate clean of excess foodstuffs and some decaying plant matter.  While this species is an excellent scavenger, supplemental foods such as bloodworms, tubifex, flake food, or sinking carnivore pellets should be offered to ensure proper nutrition.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Butterfly Peacock Bass or Ocellaris Peacock Bass (Cichla ocellaris) are native to the rivers and tributaries of northern South America in Colombia, Venezuela, Guianas &amp; Brazil. They have also been introduced to areas outside of their native habitat including: Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Singapore. 

Key characteristics to look for to possitively ID Cichla ocellaris include: 3 faint transversal bars, a round mark underneath the pectoral fin, sometimes a single distinct individualized ocellum unerneath the second dorsal fin and no black markings on the operculum (cheek).  

Being the most temperature tolerant species of Peacock Bass has made the Butterfly Peacock Bass (Cichla ocellaris) both one of the more popular aquarium species and also the most commonly transplanted species. Butterfly Peacock Bass are similar in size to Monoculus Peacock Bass, with adults typically reaching about 24 to 28 inches in length.

Butterfly Peacock Bass are ambush hunters who prefer slightly calmer waters where they can find cover near plants, drift wood or rocky formations to lay in wait for prey items. The waters of their native rivers are very warm year round with temperatures reaching upwards of 86Â° when the sun is at its peak, and with nighttime temperatures still hovering around the 78Â° to 80Â° mark. 

The water conditions of their natural habitat are acidic with a pH range of 5.0 to 6.5 and a water hardness between 5 to 15 dH; as well as, moderate flow and a large volume of water passing down river daily. Cichla have evolved perfectly for their environment with color patterns enabling them to blend into their environment, long sleek bodies and powerful pectoral and anal fins, which they use to maintain ambush positions in flowing river waters and ambush prey. 

Butterfly Peacock Bass are becoming much more available within the aquarium hobby as their size, pattern, coloration and aggressive feeding habits have made them very popular with aquarium hobbyists interested in keeping larger New World Cichlid species. As the popularity of Peacock Bass has grown within the aquarium hobby, breeders have been busy with propagating Cichla to fill the demand. Unfortunately most breeders do not attempt to maintain the pureness of each species and instead cross breed multiple species of Peacock Bass which has led to an abundance of hybrids being sold to aquarium hobbyists.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

When keeping Butterfly Peacock Bass in an aquarium environment, it is important to account for their large size, feeding habits and aggressive nature. Ocellaris Peacock Bass come from river ways that have a constant flow of fresh water which keeps oxygen levels high and nutrient levels low. 

Peacock Bass have become accustomed to an environment with high quality water with low levels of pollutants and high levels of oxygen. Peacock Bass aquariums need to replicate this environment through strong mechanical, chemical and biological filtration along with medium water movement. 

Peacock Bass are large fish that eat equally large meals, thus excellent filtration is required to remove the excess food and waste products produced from such a large species. The adult size of the Butterfly Peacock Bass is also an important factor in choosing the right aquarium to house them, with the size and shape of the aquarium being very important. 

Adults sizes range from around 24 to 28 inches in length, thus it is important to provide an aquarium that is long enough and wide enough from front to back to allow the Peacock Bass to swim and turn around comfortably. An aquarium of 6 to 8 feet in length and 3 feet from front to back should be considered as minimum aquarium size for an adult specimen, while smaller specimens can be raised in smaller aquariums if they are moved to larger tanks as they grow. 

The aquarium decor should be designed to provide plenty of swimming room, while also providing some areas of cover using driftwood, floating or well rooted plants and rocks with a sandy or gravel substrate.

Tank mates are an important consideration when housing adult Peacock Bass with other New World Cichlids due to their large size and aggressive temperament. A good rule of thumb is that anything that can fit in the mouth of the Peacock Bass eventually will. Tank mates should consist of other large aggressive New World Cichlids, large Catfish species and freshwater rays. 

Butterfly Peacock Bass can be kept as the only Peacock Bass species or mixed with other species of Peacock Bass. They also do well in good sized groups and will work out a dominance structure amongst themselves, which will lower aggression between fish once their social hierarchy is in place.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Wild Peacock Bass feed on a wide variety of live foods living in their river ecosystem, which include: insects, smaller fish, worms, crustaceans and amphibians. Butterfly Peacock Bass kept within the aquarium environment will readily feed on the same variety of live foods that they feed on in nature, but it is often more desirable to ween them off of live foods.

Live foods are typically more expensive, require holding facilities, more frequent trips to the aquarium store, can bring diseases and can create excess pollution in the aquarium water. Hobbyists generally ween their Peacock Bass to commercial food preparations in order to simplify their care and avoid the pitfalls or live foods. 

However, it is not uncommon for Peacock Bass enthusiasts who have weened their fish to commercial foods to provide the occasional live feeding to enjoy the prey drive and aggressive feeding technique of the Peacock Bass. Suitable commercial foods for Peacock Bass include: blood worms, pellet foods, food sticks, frozen meaty foods like krill, silver sides or similar fare. 

Peacock Bass will also consume a variety of dead meaty foods like raw shrimp, raw fish and other meaty items. Individual specimens will often have their own preferences, with some specimens eating most anything while others will be more picky about their diet.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Butterfly Peacock Bass or Ocellaris Peacock Bass (Cichla ocellaris) are native to the rivers and tributaries of northern South America in Colombia, Venezuela, Guianas & Brazil. They have also been introduced to areas outside of their native habitat including: Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Singapore. 

Key characteristics to look for to possitively ID Cichla ocellaris include: 3 faint transversal bars, a round mark underneath the pectoral fin, sometimes a single distinct individualized ocellum unerneath the second dorsal fin and no black markings on the operculum (cheek).  

Being the most temperature tolerant species of Peacock Bass has made the Butterfly Peacock Bass (Cichla ocellaris) both one of the more popular aquarium species and also the most commonly transplanted species. Butterfly Peacock Bass are similar in size to Monoculus Peacock Bass, with adults typically reaching about 24 to 28 inches in length.

Butterfly Peacock Bass are ambush hunters who prefer slightly calmer waters where they can find cover near plants, drift wood or rocky formations to lay in wait for prey items. The waters of their native rivers are very warm year round with temperatures reaching upwards of 86Â° when the sun is at its peak, and with nighttime temperatures still hovering around the 78Â° to 80Â° mark. 

The water conditions of their natural habitat are acidic with a pH range of 5.0 to 6.5 and a water hardness between 5 to 15 dH; as well as, moderate flow and a large volume of water passing down river daily. Cichla have evolved perfectly for their environment with color patterns enabling them to blend into their environment, long sleek bodies and powerful pectoral and anal fins, which they use to maintain ambush positions in flowing river waters and ambush prey. 

Butterfly Peacock Bass are becoming much more available within the aquarium hobby as their size, pattern, coloration and aggressive feeding habits have made them very popular with aquarium hobbyists interested in keeping larger New World Cichlid species. As the popularity of Peacock Bass has grown within the aquarium hobby, breeders have been busy with propagating Cichla to fill the demand. Unfortunately most breeders do not attempt to maintain the pureness of each species and instead cross breed multiple species of Peacock Bass which has led to an abundance of hybrids being sold to aquarium hobbyists.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

When keeping Butterfly Peacock Bass in an aquarium environment, it is important to account for their large size, feeding habits and aggressive nature. Ocellaris Peacock Bass come from river ways that have a constant flow of fresh water which keeps oxygen levels high and nutrient levels low. 

Peacock Bass have become accustomed to an environment with high quality water with low levels of pollutants and high levels of oxygen. Peacock Bass aquariums need to replicate this environment through strong mechanical, chemical and biological filtration along with medium water movement. 

Peacock Bass are large fish that eat equally large meals, thus excellent filtration is required to remove the excess food and waste products produced from such a large species. The adult size of the Butterfly Peacock Bass is also an important factor in choosing the right aquarium to house them, with the size and shape of the aquarium being very important. 

Adults sizes range from around 24 to 28 inches in length, thus it is important to provide an aquarium that is long enough and wide enough from front to back to allow the Peacock Bass to swim and turn around comfortably. An aquarium of 6 to 8 feet in length and 3 feet from front to back should be considered as minimum aquarium size for an adult specimen, while smaller specimens can be raised in smaller aquariums if they are moved to larger tanks as they grow. 

The aquarium decor should be designed to provide plenty of swimming room, while also providing some areas of cover using driftwood, floating or well rooted plants and rocks with a sandy or gravel substrate.

Tank mates are an important consideration when housing adult Peacock Bass with other New World Cichlids due to their large size and aggressive temperament. A good rule of thumb is that anything that can fit in the mouth of the Peacock Bass eventually will. Tank mates should consist of other large aggressive New World Cichlids, large Catfish species and freshwater rays. 

Butterfly Peacock Bass can be kept as the only Peacock Bass species or mixed with other species of Peacock Bass. They also do well in good sized groups and will work out a dominance structure amongst themselves, which will lower aggression between fish once their social hierarchy is in place.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Electric Blue Acara are a product of forced hybridization, which is the process of combing the eggs from a female fish with the sperm of a genetically similar donor male species. Which in the case of Blue Acara is easy to do as they lay eggs that are externally fertilized. In the case of Electric Blue Acara, Asian fish farms were able to fertilize Blue Acara eggs with the sperm from the genetically similar Electric Blue Ram. The resulting fertilized eggs are then hatched and raised in a lab, where the resulting offspring are then line bred in order to stabilize the recessive trait.

Like the Electric Blue Ram, the Electric Blue Acara will breed true with all of the fry exhibiting electric blue coloration. If cross bread with a typical Blue Acara, you will end up with 100% normal Blue Acara who carries a recessive electric gene. This is good for the long term health of the species, as wild Blue Acara can be bred back into the gene pool while still maintaining plenty of electric blue offspring.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Adult Electric Blue Acara will do well in aquariums that are at least 30 gallons, which should ideally have either a fine sandy substrate or small size gravel substrate, contain multiple places where they can find shelter like driftwood, rock structures, or dense vegetation and areas of both diffused and bright lighting. 

Electric Blue Acara will appreciate planted aquariums that simulate their native environment, but have been known to dig some while breeding which can cause some uprooting in plants that are not well established. Electric Blue Acara have become quite popular within a short time due not only to their brilliant coloration, but due to their good temperament and ability to fit in well in a variety of aquarium environments. 

They can peacefully coexist with all but the smallest most shy fish or largest most aggressive fish, which makes them an excellent addition to most hobbyists aquariums. It should be noted that they will become more aggressive during breeding, thus mated pairs will not be suitable for community aquariums with smaller tank mates. 

Electric Blue Acara may bully or even eat very small fish like Neon Tetra, but can be kept with most all types of community fish larger than 2 inches (5 cm) in length. Overall they are a hardy, colorful, moderately sized, long lived and full of personality community Cichlid species.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Electric Blue Acara is an omnivore and should be fed a variety of foods, such as frozen or freeze-dried brine shrimp, bloodworms, blackworms, flake food, and Cichlid pellets. They also relish live food and should occasionally be provided with live white worms, brine shrimp, or other similar items. Best to feed 2 to 3 times a day an amount of food that they will consume within a few minutes.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Electric Blue Acara are dimorphic, egg layers who practice brood care and renown for being excellent parents to their young fry. To induce breeding and sustain the ideal breeding environment, the water temperature should be raised to and maintained at about 86Â°Â F. 

The female Electric Blue Acara will lay from 150-250 eggs in a carefully cleaned and selected location, which generally consists of a hard surface like a smooth rock, slate, shell or clay pot. The eggs will hatch within 2-3 days and the fry should be swimming around within a week. 

A pair of Electric Blue Acara will continue to breed every few weeks if the fry are constantly removed shortly after they hatch. The newly hatched fry can be fed a diet of baby brine shrimp, crushed flake, crushed pellet or similar fare and then moved to other foods as they mature.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Originally collected from clear water streams throughout Peru, Colombia and Brazil, the Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid (Apistogramma cacatuoides) is now due to its popularity with the aquarium hobby mostly raised in Asian fish farms. Unlike many South American Cichlid species that originate from blackwater, low pH habitats, the Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid originates from small white water and clear water streams and shallow lakes that form during the rainy season. 

Their natural habitat consists of shallow waters that are much more susceptible to both pH and water temperature fluctuations, than the larger rivers and flood plains that many Cichlids come from. This tolerance for a range of pH and water temperature parameters helps to make Apistogramma cacatuoides excellent candidates for aquarium life. However, as with most all tropical fish species, changes in water parameters should occur gradually and not subject the fish to extreme shifts in water conditions.

While Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlids are popular within the hobby due to their ease of care and willingness to adapt to aquarium life, most hobbyists choose to keep them for their unique engaging personalities and brilliant finnage coloration. The popularity of the Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid has led to them being primarily raised in fish farms as opposed to being collected in the wild. 

This was done primarily to supply the demand for the species, but has also led to line-breeding of the fish in order to accentuate the bright red and orange of their dorsal fins. The end result of this is that the Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlids now found within the hobby have much more brightly colored finnage (especially the dorsal fin) than their wild cousins. A displaying male specimen will undoubtedly catch the eye of even the most selective of hobbyist.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Ideally, hobbyists should keep Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlids in environments that are similar to their native habitats and provide the fish with a sense of security. In the case of Apistogramma Cichlids, who live primarily in the lower regions of the aquarium, they will appreciate an aquarium that has a larger footprint or breeder style tank. 

Suitable substrates include sand, gravel or a mix of the two, with areas of rocky caves or crevices, driftwood or wood root and a mix of plants that include some mid-ground to foreground plants like Anubias or Java Fern. Despite most Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid specimens now being farm raised these days, they do come from waters that have dense vegetation and constant flow which keep nutrient levels and nitrate at a minimum. Thus it is best to provide good nutrient export either via live plants, partial water changes or ideally both.

It is this constant water flow and dense vegetation of their native habitat that has shaped the social structure of this species, with dense populations of fish living in a relatively small area. Apistogramma cacatuoides kept in larger groups will coexist well with one other; however, large groups of fish, even 3 inch long fish, require a fairly large aquarium (75 gallons or more) to do well and thrive. 

The benefit to keeping large groups of Dwarf Cichlids is that they will exhibit little to no aggression towards each other, as no single individual will be able to establish its own territory. However, they are more commonly kept in small groups along with other fish species in planted or community aquariums. In this case it is best to keep a single male and a group of females in order to not have aggression problems between a dominant male and the sub-dominant males specimens. This aggression with sub-dominant Apistogramma is similar to the aggression that other Cichlid species exhibit towards one another when kept in small groups.

Water flow and dissolved oxygen are also important factors when keeping Apistogramma Cichlids, as their native river habitats have good amounts of water flow and high levels of dissolved oxygen. Hobbyists will want to have a good amount of water flow within the aquarium, either via a canister filter return, spray bar or a dedicated powerhead positioned to agitate the surface of the water and create higher levels of dissolved oxygen.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid like other Apistogramma Cichlids is carnivore that feed primarily on insects, insect larvae, small crustaceans and small worms in their native environment. They are not picky eaters and will accept a wide variety of foods, but they do best in the aquarium environment when fed a variety of frozen and freeze-dried commercial foods like blood worms, brine shrimp, krill, tubifex worms and other similar meaty items. 

They can also be offered high quality carnivore flakes and mini pellets intended for freshwater carnivores. It is not recommended to feed only flake or pellet foods as this will typically lead to more a more faded coloration and will often lack all the nutrients and minerals required to maintain a healthy immune system. It is best to feed smaller meals 2 to 3 times per day. Apistogramma cacatuoides will also readily consume live foods like small worms, brine shrimp, daphnia and other similar items.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Apistogramma cacatuoides are egg layers, with the female typically finding a suitable rocky cave or crevice in which to deposit her eggs. However, specimens in the aquarium environment will also utilize clay pots and even PVC tubes as a place to deposit their eggs. 

Hobbyists wanting to breed the Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid should either pair up a male specimen with a small group of females or keep a group of males and females together and wait for one of the males to establish dominance over the others, then removing the sub-dominant males in order to avoid them being beaten up or killed.

The aquarium housing the dominant male and his harem of females should contain enough caves or cave like structures so that each female has her own. The cave openings should not face one another, and should be staggered around the aquarium enough to break up the line of sight and give each female some privacy from the others. Ideally other aquarium decor like driftwood and/or plants should be used as well to prevent infighting within the harem.

The male will court the females though a dance like motion during which he will display brilliant coloration and erect, brightly colored finnage. After successfully catching the attention of one of the females, the male will follow the female to her chosen cave where she will lay her eggs on the cave wall or ceiling and the male will fertilize the eggs. In larger aquariums, 40 to 75 gallons males will breed with multiple females; however, in smaller 15 to 20 gallon aquariums it is usually best to remove the other specimens.

The female will guard the fry constantly until they are free swimming juveniles and for several weeks thereafter. She will generally move them about the tank in an effort to sheppard them towards potential food sources like tiny crustaceans and insect larvae. Hobbyists will want to provide meaty items like newly hatched baby brine shrimp, finely crushed flake food or similar items. Java moss, sponge material or similar aquarium decor is an ideal place for young Apistogramma to pick at and graze on tiny foodstuffs. [color=#bed8f8][b]Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Azul Peacock Bass (Cichla piquiti) are native to the rivers and tributaries of northern South America in Colombia, Venezuela, Guianas &amp; Brazil. They have also been introduced to areas outside of their native habitat including: Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Singapore. Key characteristics to look for to positively ID Cichla piquiti include: grayish brown body color, bluish coloration on fins, vertical dark bars throughout the length of the body and yellow dots along with a eye-spot on their tail fin. 

Cichla piquiti are very fast growers, who will grow quickly to about 16 to 18 inches in length and then over time depending on food source, water condition and tank size, reach an eventual adult length of upwards of 29 inches. They are a very fast swimming and boisterous species that will hit prey items (even pellet foods) with amazing force that can startle other tank mates and their human owners alike.

Despite the aggression they show towards their prey, they are not considered to be that aggressive towards other suitably sized tank mates. The reason size is so critical is that tank mates that are not at least half as large as the Azul Peacock Bass will usually be reguarded as prey. So despite not being too aggressive towards tank mates, their shear size and fast, burst ambush style feeding behavior make Azul Peacocks a poor choice to keep with timid fish species, who may find aquarium life with an Azul difficult. 

Azul Peacock Bass are ambush hunters who navigate their native river and tributary waters in search of prey both above and below the waters surface. Their native waters are very warm year round with temperatures reaching upwards of 86Â° when the sun is at its peak, and with nighttime temperatures still hovering around the 76Â° to 80Â° mark. The water conditions of their natural habitat are acidic with a pH range of 5.0 to 6.5 and a water hardness between 5 to 15 dH; as well as, moderate flow and a large volume of water passing down river daily. 

Cichla have evolved perfectly for their environment with color patterns enabling them to blend into their environment, long sleek bodies and powerful pectoral and anal fins, which they use to maintain ambush positions in flowing river waters and ambush prey. 

Azul Peacock Bass are available within the aquarium hobby despite the Brazilian government banning their export from many locations; however, their size, pattern, coloration and aggressive feeding habits have made them highly sought after with aquarium hobbyists interested in keeping larger New World Cichlid species. 

As the popularity of Peacock Bass in general has grown within the aquarium hobby, breeders have been busy with propagating Cichla to fill the demand. Unfortunately most breeders do not attempt to maintain the pureness of each species and instead cross breed multiple species of Peacock Bass which has led to an abundance of hybrids being sold to aquarium hobbyists.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

When keeping Azul Peacock Bass in an aquarium environment, it is important to account for their large size, feeding habits and aggressive nature. Azul Peacock Bass come from river ways that have a constant flow of fresh water which keeps oxygen levels high and nutrient levels low. Peacock Bass have become accustomed to an environment with high quality water with low levels of pollutants and high levels of oxygen. Peacock Bass aquariums need to replicate this environment through strong mechanical, chemical and biological filtration along with medium water movement. 

Peacock Bass are large fish that eat equally large meals, thus excellent filtration is required to remove the excess food and waste products produced from such a large species. The adult size of the Azul Peacock Bass is also an important factor in choosing the right aquarium to house them, with the size and shape of the aquarium being very important. 

Adult sizes range from around 26 to 28 inches in length, thus it is important to provide an aquarium that is long enough and wide enough from front to back to allow the Peacock Bass to swim and turn around comfortably. An aquarium of 6 to 8 feet in length and 3 feet from front to back should be considered as minimum aquarium size for an adult specimen, while smaller specimens can be raised in smaller aquariums if they are moved to larger tanks as they grow. The aquarium decor should be designed to provide plenty of swimming room, while also providing some areas of cover using driftwood, floating or well rooted plants and rocks with a sandy or gravel substrate.

Tank mates are an important consideration when housing adult Peacock Bass with other New World Cichlids due to their large size and aggressive temperament. A good rule of thumb is that anything that can fit in the mouth of the Peacock Bass eventually will. Tank mates should consist of other large aggressive New World Cichlids, large Catfish species and freshwater rays. 

Safe tank mates should be roughly at least half the size of the Azul Peacock Bass to be sure that they will not be seen as a food source. Azul Peacock Bass can be kept as the only Peacock Bass species or mixed with other species of Peacock Bass. When kept in a suitably large aquarium, they will do well in good sized groups and will work out a dominance structure among themselves, which will lower aggression between fish once their social hierarchy is in place.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Wild Peacock Bass feed on a wide variety of live foods living in their river ecosystem, which include: insects, smaller fish, worms, crustaceans and amphibians. Azul Peacock Bass kept within the aquarium environment will readily feed on the same variety of live foods that they feed on in nature, but it is often more desirable to ween them off of live foods. 

Live foods are typically more expensive, require holding facilities, more frequent trips to the aquarium store, can bring diseases and can create excess pollution in the aquarium water. Hobbyists generally ween their Peacock Bass to commercial food preparations in order to simplify their care and avoid the pitfalls or live foods. 

However, it is not uncommon for Peacock Bass enthusiasts who have weened their fish to commercial foods to provide the occasional live feeding to enjoy the prey drive and aggressive feeding technique of the Peacock Bass. Suitable commercial foods for Peacock Bass include: blood worms, pellet foods, food sticks, frozen meaty foods like krill, silver sides or similar fare. 

Peacock Bass will also consume a variety of dead meaty foods like raw shrimp, raw fish and other meaty items. Individual specimens will often have their own preferences, with some specimens eating most anything while others will be more picky about their diet. [color=#bed8f8][b]Azul Peacock Bass[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The Red Texas Cichlid is a hybrid fish that was developed by the cross breeding of Flowerhorn Cichlid (Cichlasoma sp.) and Texas Cichlid (Herichthys cyanoguttatus), thus does not exist in the wild. In a sense the Red Texas Cichlid is a second generation hybrid, as the Flowerhorn Cichlid with which it is cross bred is already a hybrid produced by cross breeding the Trimac Cichlid with other various Central American Cichlids. As Flowerhorn cross breeding began in the mid 80s, they have since been bred with multiple other species and line bred for coloration and pattern, which has made them almost indistinguishable from their wild origins.

While Flowerhorn Cichlids are well established with various strains of reproducible colors and patterns, the Red Texas Cichlid is in a much earlier stage of its development. Because of this the overall quality of each fish varies widely between individual specimens, which means only a few specimens grow to exhibit the brilliant red and black colorations that are so highly sought after. The rarity of species with the brilliant red show coloration and the scarcity of their availability in the aquarium hobby has meant that their price is often quite expensive and can vary wildly between various aquarium stores.

While high quality show specimens are a rare find, aquarium stores will often have fry or juvenile Red Texas Cichlid which while a gamble, may turn out to be an attractive fish. While most fish will never develop the brilliant full body red coloration, and will instead have a large number of black spots on their body making them more black than red. However, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and many of the red, black and pearl fleck specimens while not show quality turn out to be very attractive and rewarding fish.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Red Texas Cichlid should be housed in a aquarium of at least 75 gallons, with 125 gallons or larger being recommended for multiple specimens. Their environment should have a sand or fine gravel substrate, should contain an adequate amount of rock caves or pieces of driftwood to hide among and use as territory. If live plants are used, make sure they are either secured to driftwood, rock, or planted in pots below the substrate as they will either be shredded or relocated. 

Light intensity is not an issue, although the species prefers to have the option for shade it its disposal. Red Texas Cichlids are hardy in nature, but are messy eaters and can be sensitive to high levels of nitrates; they should be provided with strong and efficient biological, mechanical, and chemical filtration in order to ensure clean water conditions and keep nitrate levels down. When keeping large Cichlids like these, hobbyists will generally need to perform regular water changes even when using a good filtration system.

Aggression is a serious consideration when keeping Red Texas Cichlids as they are considerable more aggressive than other Texas Cichlids (Herichthys cyanoguttatus). When planning tank mates for this species, it is best to think of the Red Texas Cichlid as a Flowerhorn Cichlid rather than as Texas Cichlid. They should only be kept with other large robust semi-aggressive to aggressive fish species in a suitably large aquarium. 

Keeping Red Texas Cichlid in a community of large Cichlid will mean that a 6 to 8 foot long tank is a minimum with something along the lines of an 8 foot 240 gallon to 300 gallon being recommended. While they require a large aquarium if you are going to house them with other Cichlids, they can be kept alone in tanks as small as 75 gallons.

Aggression varies by individual (as with most Cichlids) and until they grow to be larger (at least 6 inches), they unlikely to display much aggression towards other tank mates. However, as they grow they will attempt to control territory within the aquarium unless there is already a dominant fish within the aquarium or the tank is over crowded preventing any one fish from dominating. 

Compatible tank mates are usually other aggressive Cichlids such as Oscars, Jaguar Cichlids, and Jack Dempsey, large Catfish, large dither fish species and Robust Plecostomus variants are also a good choice as they are naturally armored and not usually perceived as a threat.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

The Red Texas Cichlid is an omnivore and naturally eats worms, insects, small invertebrates, and plant matter in the wild. However, they are not picky eaters and will easily adjust to a wide variety of commercial fish foods. It is best to provide a varied diet of commercial foods with live foods being reserved as a treat or supplemental feeding, this will ensure good health and contribute to coloration intensity. 

Suitable commercial foods include: live, frozen, or freeze-dried krill, ghost shrimp, crickets, worms, as well as vitamin-enriched, omnivore oriented flake, pellet and stick food items. Feed one or twice daily an amount the fish will consume within a few minutes. Young fish should be fed more often in order to support their natural growth cycle, adult fish will do well to be fed once or twice a day. Always keep an eye on the overall girth of the fish and adjust feeding accordingly if it appears to be too thin or appears overweight. [color=#bed8f8][b]Red Texas Cichlid[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Spotted Severum (Heros notatus) are native to the blackwater streams and tributaries of Rio Negro basin and surrounding areas of northern Brazil. Their native river habitat is considered a blackwater biotope, as the aquatic environment in these areas has water that is stained brown from tree root and decaying leaf matter, along with filtered lighting due to the sun being heavily blocked by the thick jungle canopy. While the rivers and larger tributaries often have fast flowing waters, Spotted Severum are usually found living on marginal areas of the water ways in and amongst submerged tree root and dense aquatic vegetation.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

The Spotted Severum can be considered a community Cichlid species, as the combination of their mild temperament and larger size allows them to be kept with a wide variety of Cichlid species and even larger community fish species such as barbs, larger characins and larger sharks and loaches. They can also hold their own with semi-aggressive to aggressive Cichlid species like Oscars, Jack Dempsey, Pike Cichlids and other similar larger predators. 

Keep in mind that the Spotted Severum despite having a good temperament, will eat smaller fish that they can fit in their mouth and will be seen as food themselves by very large predators like large Snakehead, Arapaima or even very large Peacock Bass.

An aquarium of around 50 gallons should be considered a minimum size aquarium for Spotted Severum, with a pair of Severum needing an aquarium closer to 75 gallons, or if multiple tank mates are added. They ideally prefer a fine sand or small smooth gravel substrate as they will scoop sand with their mouths looking for food items. They will also greatly prefer a tank with plenty of structures for shelter, like  driftwood, rocky piles, rock formations, cave-like structures and either live or fake plants. Live plants are greatly appreciated, but do not always last long unless a prolific species is used (Anacharis, Cabomba, Hornwort); although omnivorous they have a sweet tooth for live plants and vegetables. 

High quality biological, chemical, and mechanical filtration is recommended, as they are Cichlids who with thick bodies and larger food consumption, will put out a fair amount of waste products into the water. They prefer water that is slightly acidic and soft, with a pH of 5.5 to 7.0 and a hardness of up to 10Â°H. 

Lighting intensity is not an issue; however, to best replicate their native environment some areas of shade or diffused lighting will be appreciated. This can be achieved through floating plants, thick vegetation or larger rocky cave structures. 

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Spotted Severum are omnivorous, who eat a variety of foods including: insects, small crustaceans and vegetable matter present in their natural habitat. They have a tendency to prefer a lot of vegetable matter and will accept peas, lettuce, chopped zucchini, and chopped cucumber; they should also be supplemented with a variety of meaty and vitamin enriched foods such as live, frozen or freeze-dried ghost shrimp, bloodworms, mealworms, earthworms, crickets, and nutritional cichlid and algae (Spirulina) based pellets. They will also do very well with quality stable pellet or stick foods designed for Cichlids and omnivores. It is best to feed between one to three times daily an amount of food they will consume within a few minutes.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

As the Spotted Severum is not seen for sale nearly as much other Severum species, it is believed that they are not being successfully bred in large numbers with commercial fish breeders. Most specimens commonly found within the trade are imported wild caught specimens or juvenile specimens from boutique or hobbyist breeders. 

Hobbyists looking to breed Spotted Severum (Heros notatus) will most likely find the most difficult aspect being the acquisition of a group of individuals, from which over time a mating pair can emerge. Beyond establishing a mating pair, providing a proper habitat and maintaining water conditions conducive to stimulating breeding, other aspects of breeding should be fairly common to other Severum species.

In general breeding Severum is not overly difficult, but they can often take quite a while to pair up. The parents will look for a cave or a flat rock surface or section of driftwood and the female will lay between 200-800 eggs; the male will fertilize them and then the female will tend to the eggs while the male patrols the perimeter. The eggs will hatch in 3-5 days and the fry will be relocated to a pre-dugout pit area in the substrate. The fry will be free-swimming within a week and then able to accept finely crushed flake food and baby brine shrimp. 

As with other Severum species, it may take a while for the breeding pair to get it right and it is common for the parents to eat the fry at various stages for the first dozen or so attempts. They will eventually sort things out and get it right, but the fry could also be removed and raised if continuous failed attempts are excessive. [color=#bed8f8][b]Spotted Severum[/b][/color]

Spotted Severum are omnivorous, who eat a variety of foods including: insects, small crustaceans and vegetable matter present in their natural habitat. They have a tendency to prefer a lot of vegetable matter and will accept peas, lettuce, chopped zucchini, and chopped cucumber; they should also be supplemented with a variety of meaty and vitamin enriched foods such as live, frozen or freeze-dried ghost shrimp, bloodworms, mealworms, earthworms, crickets, and nutritional cichlid and algae (Spirulina) based pellets. They will also do very well with quality stable pellet or stick foods designed for Cichlids and omnivores. It is best to feed between one to three times daily an amount of food they will consume within a few minutes.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

As the Spotted Severum is not seen for sale nearly as much other Severum species, it is believed that they are not being successfully bred in large numbers with commercial fish breeders. Most specimens commonly found within the trade are imported wild caught specimens or juvenile specimens from boutique or hobbyist breeders. 

Hobbyists looking to breed Spotted Severum (Heros notatus) will most likely find the most difficult aspect being the acquisition of a group of individuals, from which over time a mating pair can emerge. Beyond establishing a mating pair, providing a proper habitat and maintaining water conditions conducive to stimulating breeding, other aspects of breeding should be fairly common to other Severum species.

In general breeding Severum is not overly difficult, but they can often take quite a while to pair up. The parents will look for a cave or a flat rock surface or section of driftwood and the female will lay between 200-800 eggs; the male will fertilize them and then the female will tend to the eggs while the male patrols the perimeter. The eggs will hatch in 3-5 days and the fry will be relocated to a pre-dugout pit area in the substrate. The fry will be free-swimming within a week and then able to accept finely crushed flake food and baby brine shrimp. 

As with other Severum species, it may take a while for the breeding pair to get it right and it is common for the parents to eat the fry at various stages for the first dozen or so attempts. They will eventually sort things out and get it right, but the fry could also be removed and raised if continuous failed attempts are excessive.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Altolamprologus calvus (Pearly Calvus) have become very popular with African Cichlid owners as they have a slender aggressive body shape, steep sloping forehead with a large mouth and attractive coloration with stripes on the head and collar region and brilliant white spots on the posterior two-thirds of the their sides, all this combined with their easy going temperament make them a good choice for a variety of aquarium setups.  

Pearly Calvus are known for being slow growers and can take over two years to reach their maximum size of 6 inches for males and 4 inches for females.  They are found in eastern parts of Lake Tanganyikan around rocky outcrops and other areas with plenty of rock caves and crevices. There are several morphological varieties of Pearly Calvus including: black, white, yellow, and even zebra, which looks a lot like a white version of Alto. compressiceps.

Pearly Calvus make a great addition to most any Tanganyikan community setup, except for setups with much smaller fishes or shellfish, as these would most likely become a meal. They can also be kept with many of the fishes from Lakes Malawi and Victoria, provided the latter also require a high protein diet.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Pearly Calvus require an aquarium with plenty of rocks forming caves and rock ledges and crevices. When initially added to the aquarium, it is not unusual for this species to hide in the rocks most of the time. However, over time they will adapt to their new environment and spend most of their time in the lower areas of the aquarium along the substrate and lower rocky areas. It is important to not overfeed the aquarium during this period trying to get food to the Calvus, they will emerge from their rock cave when they are ready and will begin eating hardily at that time. This mimics there behavior in the wild where they spend their time along the substrate looking for shellfish and other foodstuffs to scoop up from the ground or from within rock caves. 

They are quite peaceful in the aquarium and will not fight with other fish species including similar sized species as well. While they have a good temperament for a community cichlid aquarium, they are very capable of defending themselves and will use their thick scales as both a strong defense and for inflicting damage on their attacker. Unlike many other African Cichlid species, Pearly Calvus are not territorial and will coexist with other species or others of their own kind.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Pearly Calvus are hardy eaters (once established) and will readily take most any type of high-protein meaty foods including: brine shrimp, meaty pellets, cichlid flakes and live foods. They will also consume fish species that are much smaller than themselves and will eat shellfish and crustaceans.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Pearly Calvus are substrate spawners and it is not uncommon to miss that they have spawned as they are very secretive spawners. Calvus like to spawn in tight confines such as a rocky cave, deep rocky crevice, rock overhang, inside a shell or pot or any suitable area that the male of the species cannot enter. The male will release his milt at the entrance of the females spawning location and both the male and female will use their fins to fan the milt onto the eggs, which will be dropped on the substrate. 

A typical spawn for a younger pair will number 75 eggs while a mature breeding pair will number around 200 eggs, with females being able to spawn every 30 to 40 days. The fry are very slow growers and will need upwards of 9 months to reach approximately 1 inch in size, the male young will be about 1/3rd larger than the females. While it is possible to raise the fry in the parent aquarium, the survival rate will be increased drastically if the fry are moved to a grow-out tank with a seasoned sponge filter. 

The fry calvus are bottom huggers, thus for this reason, you will need to pay extra attention to water quality as extra food can quickly foul the substrate. A mixture of Cyclops-eeze, Hikari First Start, and finely ground earthworm and brine shrimp flakes should provide the necessary nutrition with as little excess as possible.  Partial weekly water changes will help insure that proper water conditions are maintained. [color=#bed8f8][b]Pearly Calvus[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

The Zebra Obliquidens (Astatotilapia latifasciata) is a popular Lake Victoria species of African Cichlid, that is popular within the aquarium hobby due to its colorful appearance and peaceful disposition. This species is also bread heavily in the aquarium trade as it is heavily threatened in the wild and may be nearing extinction. 

While the females of the species are attractive in their own right, they lack the bursts of red and yellow that the males posses.  It is the bursts of red and yellow on the belly of the fish with the vertical black bars over top a silver body that makes this fish very distinguishable amongst its peers.  

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Zebra Obliquidens are a dream species for the aquarium hobby as they are very easy to care for and can easily get along well with other fish species.  They prefer neutral to moderately hard water conditions, with regular partial water changes or the presence of a high-end filtration system. It is important to provide plenty of rocky hiding places in order to provide this species with a sense of security and a place to retreat to when it feels threatened. 

They may become aggressive towards others if it is not provided with plenty of caves and crevices as it will feel the need to fight over what little cover is provided. Male Zebra Obliquidens typically get about 5 inches in length, with females reaching about 4 inches in length. While this species is a very suitable candidate for a community African Cichlid aquarium, they should not be kept with species that are much larger or overly aggressive species.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

Zebra Obliquidens are omnivores (eating primarily the diet of an insectivore), thus they will eat a variety of foods ranging from plankton and insects to more meaty foods including: krill, mysis shrimp, daphnia, chichlid flake, cichlid pellets and other meaty (protein rich) preparations.  

This species is a hardy eater, that should be fed multiple times a day a diet that is rich in protein and as varied as possible, in order to provide balanced nutrition and promote a healthy immune system.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Zebra Obliquidens are prolific spawners that are easily bread within the aquarium environment. They will require a good sized aquarium of 125 gallons or greater, along with flat rocks or slate on which to lay their eggs. The females of the species will actually guard the fry for approximately 2 months after they are born, which means that the fry can be raised in the same aquarium as the parents.  

They should begin feeding almost immediately on baby brine shrimp or similar preparations and will grow quickly, reaching their distinctive shape and form in about a week. [color=#bed8f8][b]Zebra Obliquidens[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Often regarded as a &quot;showpiece&quot; species the Frontosa Cichlid of Lake Tanganyika is a truly impressive specimen that has both great coloration and impressive body size &amp; shape with elaborate fins. Frontosa Cichlids were originally introduced into the hobby because of their attractive appearance.  However, they have become even more popular as hobbyists have learned that they have great personalities, with an almost &quot;dog&quot; like quality that has helped to endear them to hobbyists even more. 

While this species is originally from the deeper areas of Lake Tanganyika, specimens found within the aquarium hobby these days are mostly from captive breeding programs that have been successfully breeding the Frontosa Cichlid for some time. Successful captive breeding programs are important to this and many other species as pressure from aquarium hobbyist collectors and local fisherman catching them for the food supply puts far too great a strain on their native populations.

Frontosa Cichlids generally have a white or light blue body with either 6 or 7 black vertical bars along each side. As adults, they develop a large cephalic hump on the front of their head which is typically more pronounced on the male than the female. This hump is actually a large fat deposit that rests atop a dorsal muscle that tends to extend forward. The hump develops and increases in size with age and is usually a sign of sexual fecundity. 

Their fins also become more elaborate with age, which makes a mature Frontosa a very impressive sight as the combination of their large size, attractive coloration and elaborate fins make them a truly impressive sight to behold.  

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Frontosa Cichlids live relatively long (25 plus years) sedentary lifestyles in nature as they do not expend much energy while slowly swimming about or hunting. Frontosa utilize a unique trait that allows them to see well in darkness, which allows them to prey on smaller fish species while they sleep near the lake bottom. Frontosa simply swim along slowly and feast on the smaller fish as they sleep.

They are not overly aggressive within the aquarium environment, but can be a little territorial. They can be kept with most any species of African Cichlid that is not small enough to be considered as food. They will appreciate a sandy or partially sandy substrate along with some rocky formations in order to simulate their natural surroundings. 

While some rocks are much appreciated by the Frontosa Cichlid to give them a sense of security, too many rocky structures can be a problem as Frontosa are somewhat clumsy swimmers that need plenty of open space to move about. In nature Frontosa Cichlids live in large groups and prefer to live in groups in the aquarium as well. While one specimen can be kept singularly, it is more ideal to keep them in groups of 4 or more individuals. The best group makeup would be to have 3 females per male and between 4 to 8 specimens for the average larger aquarium.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

In the aquarium environment, Frontosa Cichlids should be fed a variety of meaty foods including: small feeder fish (live or frozen), shrimp, krill, and worms. Larger meaty pellets are also a good choice, but flake foods should only be fed to juveniles, as adult specimens will likely ignore them. [color=#bed8f8][b]Frontosa Cichlid[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Caudopunctatus Cichlids are a dwarf species of Cichlid found in Africa&#039;s Lake Tanganyika. They are found living very near to the coast line, usually in depths of water of six feet or less. They move about the coastal shallows along the sandy bottom moving between the rocks and shells in search of small crustaceans on which to prey. While they spend much of their time in close proximity to rocks or shells, they do this for protection and are not &quot;true&quot; shell dwellers that will live inside of a shell. 

N. caudopunctatus is a monomorphic species as there are very few distinguishing traits between males and females. However, as adults the males will attain about 1 more inch in length than females which helps tell adult specimens apart. Another distinguishing trait is the higher level of aggression shown by males than females, with the exception of when the female is tending to eggs or newly hatched fry.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Caudopunctatus Cichlids make very interesting aquarium specimens as they are very active and will spend their time sculpting the substrate, patrolling the caves and crevices of the aquarium and overall being fun to watch. As African Cichlids go, they are not too aggressive and will do well with similarly sized tank mates of similar disposition. 

The ideal aquarium setup for N. Caudopunctatus should have a sandy substrate and plenty of rocks, shells, caves and crevices for them to explore and seek shelter in when threatened. A minimum aquarium size of 30 gallons is recommended, with a larger aquarium required for many individuals or if kept with other African cichlid species, so that they can all establish a suitable amount of territory and reduce fighting that occurs with overcrowding. 

Mixing aragonite and/or keeping plenty of shells in the aquarium with help buffer the pH and alkalinity which will help keep the water chemistry close to their native environment.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding &amp; Nutrition[/b][/color]

In nature, Caudopunctatus Cichlids diet consists primarily of small invertebrates and zooplankton.  Hobbyists should feed them a varied diet of Mysis &amp; Brine shrimp, Cyclopeeze, blood worms and high quality meaty flaked &amp; pellet foods. 

It is best to provide multiple varieties of foodstuffs to help insure that the fish receives a balanced diet, which helps them maintain a strong immune system. Feedings should consist of amounts of food that the fish will consume within a few minutes fed multiple times per day.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Caudopunctatus Cichlids will breed within the aquarium environment if provided proper water chemistry, a sandy substrate, and some type of suitable aqua-scaping like rocks, shells, sinking root/driftwood or flowerpots. A mating pair of Caudopunctatus Cichlids will find a secluded location within the tank near a rock, shell or flowerpot to excavate a small nest in the substrate by creating semi-circular area at the base of their spawning site. 

The female will attach the eggs to the bottom of the rock, shell or flowerpot, where the male will fertilize the eggs then be driven off by the female. A batch of around 40 to 60 fry will hatch in about 72 hours and will become free-swimming in about 8 to 10 days. During this time the mother will look after them and attack any fish who intrude on their nesting site. 

The fry should be fed their own food designed for fry, including Daphnia, Cyclop-eeze, or freshly hatched Brine Shrimp. Crushed flake food is accepted after about two weeks of development. [color=#bed8f8][b]Caudopunctatus Cichlid[/b][/color]

[color=#bed8f8][b]Species Information[/b][/color]

Caudopunctatus Cichlids are a dwarf species of Cichlid found in Africa's Lake Tanganyika. They are found living very near to the coast line, usually in depths of water of six feet or less. They move about the coastal shallows along the sandy bottom moving between the rocks and shells in search of small crustaceans on which to prey. While they spend much of their time in close proximity to rocks or shells, they do this for protection and are not "true" shell dwellers that will live inside of a shell. 

N. caudopunctatus is a monomorphic species as there are very few distinguishing traits between males and females. However, as adults the males will attain about 1 more inch in length than females which helps tell adult specimens apart. Another distinguishing trait is the higher level of aggression shown by males than females, with the exception of when the female is tending to eggs or newly hatched fry.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Aquarium Care[/b][/color]

Caudopunctatus Cichlids make very interesting aquarium specimens as they are very active and will spend their time sculpting the substrate, patrolling the caves and crevices of the aquarium and overall being fun to watch. As African Cichlids go, they are not too aggressive and will do well with similarly sized tank mates of similar disposition. 

The ideal aquarium setup for N. Caudopunctatus should have a sandy substrate and plenty of rocks, shells, caves and crevices for them to explore and seek shelter in when threatened. A minimum aquarium size of 30 gallons is recommended, with a larger aquarium required for many individuals or if kept with other African cichlid species, so that they can all establish a suitable amount of territory and reduce fighting that occurs with overcrowding. 

Mixing aragonite and/or keeping plenty of shells in the aquarium with help buffer the pH and alkalinity which will help keep the water chemistry close to their native environment.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Feeding & Nutrition[/b][/color]

In nature, Caudopunctatus Cichlids diet consists primarily of small invertebrates and zooplankton.  Hobbyists should feed them a varied diet of Mysis & Brine shrimp, Cyclopeeze, blood worms and high quality meaty flaked & pellet foods. 

It is best to provide multiple varieties of foodstuffs to help insure that the fish receives a balanced diet, which helps them maintain a strong immune system. Feedings should consist of amounts of food that the fish will consume within a few minutes fed multiple times per day.

[color=#bed8f8][b]Breeding Information[/b][/color]

Caudopunctatus Cichlids will breed within the aquarium environment if provided proper water chemistry, a sandy substrate, and some type of suitable aqua-scaping like rocks, shells, sinking root/driftwood or flowerpots. A mating pair of Caudopunctatus Cichlids will find a secluded location within the tank near a rock, shell or flowerpot to excavate a small nest in the substrate by creating semi-circular area at the base of their spawning site. 

The female will attach the eggs to the bottom of the rock, shell or flowerpot, where the male will fertilize the eggs then be driven off by the female. A batch of around 40 to 60 fry will hatch in about 72 hours and will become free-swimming in about 8 to 10 days. During this time the mother will look after them and attack any fish who intrude on their nesting site. 

The fry should be fed their own food designed for fry, including Daphnia, Cyclop-eeze, or freshly hatched Brine Shrimp. Crushed flake food is accepted after about two weeks of development.
