			<strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
		<p>
			In order to process orders efficiently, when you place an order with us or register an account on the Sites we actively collect the following personal information: name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address and phone number, (&ldquo;<strong>Personal Information</strong>&rdquo;). If you prefer not to disclose your Personal Information online, you can always place your order by visiting one of the many stores where our products are sold.</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Usage Information</strong></p>
		<p>
			We (including through our third party service providers) may inactively collect from you information that is not in the same category as Personal Information. For example, we might track information about the date and time you access the Sites, the type of web browser you used, and the websites from which you connect to our Sites. We collect and use this and other non-Personal Information (such as demographic data) to analyze and develop our business strategy and to determine how you found out about us, your interests regarding our products and services and how to further improve our Sites. We, or a third party, may also collect information from your activities on the Sites for the purposes of providing advertisements and other content to you at the Sites that are customized to your interests and preferences. To accomplish all this, and also to allow us to offer our customers streamlined ordering and other useful features, we, as do many websites, use the technologies listed below and other similar technologies (the &ldquo;<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>&rdquo;):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Cookies and Clear GIFs</strong>- Cookies are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer&rsquo;s hard drive. Cookies make web surfing easier for you by saving your customer identification information (i.e. username, password, shopping cart information, etc.) while you&rsquo;re at our Sites. Cookies also track where you travel on our Sites and what you look at and purchase. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual&rsquo;s viewing or receipt of a web page or message.</li>
			<li>
				<strong>IP Address Tracking and Clickstream Data</strong>- In addition to cookies and clear GIFs, our servers automatically collect data about your server&rsquo;s Internet address when you visit our Sites. This information, known as an Internet Protocol Address, or &ldquo;<strong>IP Address</strong>&rdquo;, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you are on the Internet. When you view pages from our Sites, our servers may record or &ldquo;log&rdquo; your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server also may record the page that linked you to us and related information including any ads you may have clicked on. Such information is known as &ldquo;<strong>Clickstream Data</strong>&rdquo;.</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Email Interconnectivity</strong>- If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools to capture data related to when you open our message, click on any links or banners it contains and make purchases.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In some cases, we may link the non-Personal Information collected through the Tracking Technologies with certain of your Personal Information. WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ACCEPTING TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ONTO YOUR COMPUTER IN NO WAY GIVES US ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER OR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU. YOU MAY SET YOUR WEB BROWSER SOFTWARE TO REJECT TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES, BUT, IF YOU DO SO, CERTAIN FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SITES MAY BE AFFECTED. Third parties (including, but not limited to, software vendors, advertisers and fulfillment companies) may also use Tracking Technologies by or through the Sites. WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHAT INFORMATION SUCH THIRD PARTIES TRACK OR COLLECT, AND HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY TRACKING, DATA COLLECTION OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
		<p>

		<p>
			Among our top priorities is keeping your Personal Information secure. The computers that store your Personal Information may be located in a separate facility which employs security technology.

		<p>

Essentially, amino acids are strung like beads in long chains in proteins. In the body, proteins are made from individual amino acids. Therefore, nutritional supplementation with amino acids ensures that all cells, tissues and organs in the body have a ready supply of amino acids.

Ultimate Nutrition's Super Whey Amino 2000 contains all of the most important amino acids and branched chain amino acids for optimal nutritional support. These amino acids, of course, provide the body with the support to produce proteins. Amino acids, however, carry out other important functions. Nutritional supplementation keeps the amino acid supply in the bloodstream within healthy range. Under some circumstances, such as stress whether it is due to high-intensity exercise or other reasons, amino acids in the blood can be depleted so that important substances in the body cannot be produced in the right amounts at the right time in the right place. For example, if serotonin cannot be synthesized in the brain, ordinary stress may be aggravated to depression. Some amino acids, such as glycine, glutamine and, among others arginine, combine with and neutralize toxins. This is of paramount importance for liver health, since detoxification takes place in the liver. People suffering from abnormal liver function, chronic arthritis, and excessive chemical exposure usually have poor amino acid profile. Branched chain amino acids (BCAA), valine, isoleucine and leucine, greatly aid detoxification and liver function. Hence, supplementation with amino acids is critical for restoration of appropriate amounts of amino acids, which help foster better health. dffdsfsdfds dfsdfdsfd 2011-06-08 18:03:20 2011-07-09 15:16:22 0 0

Hence, supplementation with amino acids is critical for restoration of appropriate amounts of amino acids, which help foster better health. Amino 2000 also contains sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine. These amino acids have been shown to help prolong life span. Typically, as people age, the amounts of these two amino acids decreases considerably. Since dietary supplementation with cysteine prolonged the life span of guinea pigs, a report in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested that maintaining optimal levels of methionine and cysteine could potentially promote longevity in humans. In summary, Ultimate Nutrition&#39;s Amino 2000 is a full-spectrum amino acid nutritional aid to that help maintain optimal levels of amino acids in the bloodstream and promote good health at any stage of life.</p> <p>
	1. Do All Amino Acids Need To Be taken in The Same Amounts?<br />
	<br />
	No. Different amino acids should be taken in different amounts. This depends upon the relative natural abundance of each amino acid in the body and amount required for incorporation in proteins. Ultimate Nutrition&#39;s Amino 2000 has amino acids in the exact amounts that the body needs for optimal function.</p>
<p>
	2. How Well Are Amino Acids Absorbed?<br />
	<br />
	Amino acids are efficiently absorbed and transported into the intestines. True, there is intense competition among various amino acids for intestinal uptake, since amino acids use the same transporters to ferry them across the intestinal wall. If sufficient amounts of the necessary amino acids are available for absorption, they are taken up in the correct ratios to serve the metabolic needs of the body.</p>
<p>
	3. Do Amino Acids Cross The Blood Brain Barrier?<br />
	<br />
	Yes! Amino acids cross the blood brain barrier using transporters similar to those employed in intestinal absorption. The brain cells use the same amino acids as those other tissues of the body. For example, the amino acid tryptophan is converted to the neurotransmitter serotonin, which controls many different functions of the brain.</p>
<p>
	4. If the Body Produces Peptides, Why Are Amino Acids Necessary?<br />
	<br />
	The body does produce certain peptides, such as di- tri- and tetra-peptides (containing two, three and four amino acids, respectively), but they are a byproduct of the digestive process or the breakdown of food in the body. As such, these peptides are not available for incorporation into the proteins and, therefore, do not serve as building blocks.</p> 2011-07-05 14:49:41 2011-07-26 15:57:29 0 0

	A growing body of literature shows that appropriate use of whey protein can maximize muscle size and strength gains from resistance training in addition to having other health- promoting effects. Amino 2002 delivers these benefits by providing several kinds of amino acid packed wheys in one tablet. The first type of whey in Amino 2002 is whey hydrosolate. Taking your proteins in a hydrolyzed state means that a lot of the work&#39;s already been done for you. As such, these types of proteins are assimilated much more quickly than other, non-hydrolyzed types.

	Whey protein is a very high quality protein, which, along with casein, makes up the major proteins in milk. Whey contains all the essential amino acids and therefore scores very high on all methods used to score protein quality. In fact, whey protein is superior to all other sources of protein when you consider how much of the nitrogen (protein is about 16% nitrogen) is retained in the body relative to the amount of nitrogen absorbed. This criterion method of protein quality is referred to as the biological value (BV), and whey protein has the highest score of 104. A growing body of literature shows that appropriate use of whey protein can maximize muscle size and strength gains from resistance training in addition to having other health- promoting effects.</p>
<p>
	Amino 2002 delivers these benefits by providing several kinds of amino acid packed wheys in one tablet. The first type of whey in Amino 2002 is whey hydrosolate. A hydrolysate is a protein where long chains of amino acids have been broken up either into little-bitty groups of amino acids or freestanding amino acids. Taking your proteins in a hydrolyzed state means that a lot of the work&#39;s already been done for you. As such, these types of proteins are assimilated much more quickly than other, non-hydrolyzed types. During your post- workout period especially you&#39;ll want a fast-acting, easily digestible protein like a whey hydrosolate. The second type is a combination of micro and ultrafiltrated whey protein concentrate and whey protein isolate. They&#39;re types of whey that have been concentrated from various dairy sources.</p>
<p>
	Whey protein isolate contains more protein with less fat and lactose per serving. Whey protein concentrates contain approximately 80% protein and little fat and lactose. Whey protein isolate is the highest yield of protein currently available, and is loaded with amino acids, including branched chain amino acids, which help them bond together better. Amino 2002&rsquo;s protein combination tastes great and is extremely digestible. Because of its speedy digestion the amino acids aid in rebuilding the body. Whey protein contains about 10% immunoglobulin proteins which helps support the body&#39;s immune system. Also it contains the highest concentration (24-25%) of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA&#39;s) of any protein source. Because of its chemical properties, Amino 2002 tablets are easiest to absorb into your muscles. A benefit of whey protein isolate is that it has the ability to enhance endogenous Glutathione production, which is the body&rsquo;s most powerful naturally occurring antioxidant. Whey contains Quadra peptides, which are shown to have pain- relieving effects. It helps decrease the sensation of muscle soreness following an intense workout. It is also used to repair and build muscles. Studies have shown whey protein isolate to have immune boosting properties.</p>

	Ultimate Nutrition Amino Bolic is a free-form amino acid complex that supplies several of the amino acids most needed by the body, in easy to swallow (and easy to take along to the gym) caplets. The benefits of using free-form amino acids are that because they&#39;re small molecules they are much easier to digest and absorb while exercising, and they don&#39;t cause bloating or gas. With Amino Bolic you get: &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull; Increased protein synthesis and recovery rate Over 6000mg of Leucine per serving to blast your body into an anabolic state Reduced muscle breakdown resulting from exercise Increased caloric efficiency for more muscle with less fat Reduced fatigue and soreness NO STIMULANTS! From vegetarians to people with protein allergies, the stressed to the mentally fatigued, bodybuilders to endurance athletes - for anyone who may not be getting a balanced diet in amino acids, Amino Bolic can offer the powerful nutrition tool you need.</p> 0 0 <p>
	Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and muscle tissue. All types of physiological processes relating to sport; such as energy, recovery, muscle gain, strength gain and fat loss are closely and significantly linked to amino acids. Amino acids have become a major part of athletes&#39; supplementation, especially among bodybuilders. Amino acids are needed to maintain and repair muscles, tendons, skin, ligaments, organs, etc. They also aid in the production of hormones, neurotransmitters, and enzymes that play a role in various bodily functions. When even one amino acid is deficient, health problems may occur.</p>
<p>
	Eating highly nutritious, high protein meals is the most familiar way to get amino acids into the diet. Even some vegetables and legumes can offer high levels of most amino acids. However, for serious athletes and those on the run, protein supplements and pure free-form amino acids provide a convenient and effective way to supplement dietary needs. Ultimate Nutrition Amino Bolic is a free-form amino acid complex that supplies several of the amino acids most needed by the body, in easy to swallow (and easy to take along to the gym) caplets. The benefits of using free-form amino acids are that because they&#39;re small molecules they are much easier to digest and absorb while exercising, and they don&#39;t cause bloating or gas. With Amino Bolic you get: Increased protein synthesis and recovery rate Over 6000mg of Leucine per serving to blast your body into an anabolic state Reduced muscle breakdown resulting from exercise Increased caloric efficiency for more muscle with less fat Reduced fatigue and soreness NO STIMULANTS! As athletes know, physical activity and bodybuilding has distinct effects on protein metabolism. Recent studies indicate that amino acid supplements can increase muscular development, particularly when involved with heavy resistance training.</p>
<p>
	Research on amino acid supplements show that athletes achieve muscular strength much quicker and experience less physical exhaustion while taking amino acid supplements or amino acid rich foods. Amino acid supplements can benefit all athletes as well as anyone wanting to ensure a balanced diet. Amino Bolic includes BCAA&rsquo;s. BCAA&rsquo;s act as a fuel source for skeletal muscle during times of trauma or stress and help prevent catabolism, all while encouraging protein synthesis. The BCAA&#39;s are especially important to athletes because they are metabolized in the muscle rather than the liver. This means that they can be used either to build new proteins or be burned as fuel to create energy. Supplementing with BCAA&#39;s has been shown to result in measurable gains in both muscle strength and size.</p>
<p>
	Taken before a workout BCAA&#39;s can improve performance and delay the onset of fatigue. They also operate as anabolic agents allowing the body to burn fat and not muscle. From vegetarians to people with protein allergies, the stressed to the mentally fatigued, bodybuilders to endurance athletes - for anyone who may not be getting a balanced diet in amino acids, Amino Bolic can offer the powerful nutrition tool you need.

	1. What are the potential advantages of taking leucine?</p>
<p>
	Leucine works as part of the BCAA&rsquo;s group to repair muscles, regulate blood sugar, and provide the body with energy. It also increases production of growth hormones, and helps burn visceral fat. Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and all three of them help promote muscle recovery after exercise. Leucine is the most effective BCAA for preventing muscle loss because it breaks down and is converted to glucose more quickly than isoleucine and valine.</p>
<p>
	2. What are Amino Acids?</p>
<p>
	Amino acids are the structural building blocks of protein. They are found in protein rich sources, such as meat and fish. Amino acids form the basic components of all living cells, found in virtually every part of the body. They are essential for the maintenance, growth and repair of muscle tissue.</p>
<p>
	3. Could One Be Deficient in BCAA&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>
	Periods of intense physical stress, such as intense weightlifting and long-distance running, can create a so-called catabolic state in which muscle tissue is broken down faster than it can be recovered and replenished.</p> 2011-07-06 11:01:30 2011-07-22 17:05:21 0 0
