2 afghan chicken 0 middle east chicken ceideburg bbq afghan 6 servings Long, slow marinating in garlicky yogurt tenderizes, moistens and<br>adds deep flavor, so you end up with skinless grilled chicken that's<br>as delicious as it is nutritionally correct. Serve with soft pita or<br>Arab flatbread and fresh yogurt.<br>Put the salt in a wide, shallow non-reactive bowl with the garlic and<br>mash them together until you have paste. Add yogurt, lemon and pepper.<br>Skin the chicken breasts, remove all visible fat and separate the<br>halves. Bend each backward to break the bones so the pieces win lie<br>flat. Add to the yogurt and turn so all surfaces are well-coated.<br>Cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate. Allow to marinate at least<br>overnight, up to a day and a half. Turn when you think of it.<br>To cook, remove breasts from marinade and wipe off all but a thin<br>film. Broil or grill about 6 inches from the heat for 6 to 8 minutes<br>a side, or until thoroughly cooked. Meat will brown somewhat but<br>should not char. Serve at once.<br>From the San Francisco Examiner, 6/2/93.<br>
3 abraysham kabaub ( silk kebab) 0 afghan desserts 30 servings SYRUP<br>OMELET<br>TO FINISH<br>*Note: Instead of pistachio nuts, walnuts may be used if desired.<br>Dissolve sugar in water in heavy pan over medium heat.  Bring to the<br>boil, add lemon juice and saffron and boil for 10 minutes.  Cool and<br>strain into a 25 cm (10 inch) pie plate.  Keep aside. Break eggs into<br>a casserole dish about 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter.  The size and<br>flat base are important. Add salt and mix eggs with fork until yolks<br>and whites are thoroughly combined - do not beat as eggs must not be<br>foamy. Heat oil in an electric frypan to 190 C (375 F) or in a 25 cm<br>(10 inch) frypan placed on a thermostatically controlled hot plate or<br>burner. Have ready nearby a long skewer, the plate of syrup, a baking<br>sheet and the nuts mixed with the cardamom. A bowl of water and a<br>cloth for drying hands are also necessary. Hold dish with eggs in one<br>hand next to the pan of oil and slightly above it. Put hand into egg,<br>palm down, so that egg covers back of hand. Lift out hand, curling<br>fingers slightly inwards, then open out over hot oil, fingers<br>pointing down.  Move hand across surface of oil so that egg falls in<br>streams from fingertips.  Dip hand in egg again and make more strands<br>across those already in pan.  Repeat 3 to 4 times until about an<br>eighth of the egg is used.  There should be a closely meshed layer of<br>egg strands about 20 cm (8 inches) across.  Work quickly so that the<br>last lot of egg is added not long after the first lot. Rinse hands<br>quickly and dry. Take skewer and slide under bubbling omelet, lift up<br>and turn over to lightly brown other side. The first side will be<br>bubbly, the underside somewhat smoother. When golden brown lift out<br>with skewer and drain over pan. Place omelet flat in the syrup, spoon<br>syrup over the top and lift out with skewer onto baking sheet. Roll<br>up with bubbly side inwards. Finish roll should be about 3 cm (1 1/4<br>inches) in diameter.  Put to one side and sprinkle with nuts. Repeat<br>with remaining egg, making 7 to 8 rolls in all. Though depth of egg<br>diminishes, you will become so adept that somehow you will get it in<br>the pan in fine strands. When cool, cut kabaubs into 4-5 cm (1 1/2 to<br>2 inch pieces and serve. These keep well in a sealed container in a<br>cool place.<br>

92 basic fondue (fondue neuchateloise) 1 appetizers cheese 1 serving (Note:  the above measurements are for *each* person.<br>Multiply by your number of guests.)<br>* Grated and mixed half and half.  ** This is Swiss cherry firewater:<br>clear, dry-tasting -- *not* "cherry brandy", which is dark and sweet.<br>Most good liquor stores should carry it, at least one of the US brands like<br>Hiram Walker, or else maybe Bols.  The best Kirsch is "Etter" brand from<br>Switzerland, but the odds of your finding it are minuscule.  -- In<br>Switzerland, fondue is usually perpared in a "caquelon", an earthenware<br>dish with a handle, glazed inside;  but any enamelled saucepan can be used,<br>or a not too shallow fireproof dish.  Rub the inside of the pan with half a<br>cut clove of garlic, and let it dry until the rubbed places feel tacky. Put<br>the wine in the dish and bring it to a boil.  Slowly start adding cheese to<br>the boiling wine, and stir constantly until each bit is dissolved, then add<br>more.  When all the cheese is in, stir the kirsch into the cornstarch well,<br>then add the mixture to the cheese and keep stirring over the heat until<br>the mixture comes to a boil again.  Add freshly ground pepper and nutmeg to<br>taste.  -- Remove the dish to on top of a small live flame (Sterno or<br>alcohol burner) and keep it bubbling slowly. Bread should have been cubed<br>~- about 1-inch cubes -- for spearing with fondue forks and stirring around<br>in the cheese.  The old custom is that if you accidentally lose the bread<br>into the cheese from the end of your fork, if you're male, you have to buy<br>a round of drinks for the table: if you're female, you have to kiss<br>everybody.  (Hmm.) .<br>Other fondue info:  Do not drink water with fondue -- it reacts unkindly in<br>your stomach with the cheese and bread.  Dry white wine or tea are the<br>usual accompaniments.  Another tradition:  the "coupe d'midi", or "shot in<br>the middle", for when you get full:  a thimbleful of Kirsch, knocked<br>straight back in the middle of the meal, usually magically produces more<br>room if you're feeling too full.  Don't ask me how this works...it just<br>does.  -- The crusty bit that forms at the bottom of the pot as the cheese<br>keeps cooking is called the "crouton", and is very nice peeled off and<br>divvied up among the guests as a sort of farewell to dinner.<br>

1993 tortilla dough/corn tortillas 6 mexican breads 1 Servings HOW TO MAKE CORN TORTILLAS: To make tortillas, you need a clay or<br>metal griddle or, failing that, a frying pan. If the dough has been<br>resting for some time, you will have to knead it again to make it<br>smooth and pliable. Form small balls of dough that fit into the palm<br>of your hand, pat each one between your palms, moving it from one to<br>the other until it forms a very thin pancake. If the dough tears,<br>patch the break and stick it down with moistened fingers. Cook on the<br>griddle turning once. When ready, the tortillas should puff up,<br>although this is not always so. To check if done, lift gently; if the<br>tortilla sticks to the griddle, it is not completely cooked.  To keep<br>warm, wrap in a napkin and place in a chiquihuite, jicara or other<br>container. As the tortillas tend to sweat, after a few minutes unwrap<br>the napking and separate them to avoid sticking, then wrap up again.<br>If freshly made tortillas are not eaten the same day, wrap them in a<br>napkin, then a plastic bag and place in the refrigerator.  In this<br>way, they can be successfully reheated. Tortillas need never go to<br>waste. If you wish, place them in the sun immediately to dry and put<br>in a paper bag. They can then be used later for making tortilla<br>crumbs, chilaquiles, tostadas or other dishes. Tortillas vary<br>considerably in size but are generally preferred small and very thin<br>for making tacos. In Oaxaca, tortillas are much bigger -- as much as<br>6, 12 or 15 inches in diameter -- and are, incredibly, made by and in<br>the same way. Tortillas can be soft or crisp; the dough used is the<br>same but the method of cooking is different. To make crisp tortillas,<br>instead of a griddle, a deep bottomless (??) pot with sloping sides<br>is used to receive the heat directly. The tortillas are slapped on<br>the outside of the pot and turned once. [I read this as you cook the<br>tortillas on the bottom of an iron pot turned upside down.]<br>Recipe from "Traditional Mexican Cooking" (sub: and its best recipes)<br>By Adela Fernandez  (Cookbook purchased in San Miguel de Allende,<br>Mexico)<br>

2 Afghan Chicken 0 Middle east Chicken Ceideburg Bbq Afghan 6 servings Long, slow marinating in garlicky yogurt tenderizes, moistens and<br>adds deep flavor, so you end up with skinless grilled chicken that's<br>as delicious as it is nutritionally correct.

Add yogurt, lemon and pepper.<br>Skin the chicken breasts, remove all visible fat and separate the<br>halves. Bend each backward to break the bones so the pieces win lie<br>flat. Add to the yogurt and turn so all surfaces are well-coated.<br>Cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate. Allow to marinate at least<br>overnight, up to a day and a half. Turn when you think of it.<br>To cook, remove breasts from marinade and wipe off all but a thin<br>film. Broil or grill about 6 inches from the heat for 6 to 8 minutes<br>a side, or until thoroughly cooked. Meat will brown somewhat but<br>should not char.

3 Abraysham Kabaub ( Silk Kebab) 0 Afghan Desserts 30 servings SYRUP<br>OMELET<br>TO FINISH<br>*Note: Instead of pistachio nuts, walnuts may be used if desired.<br>Dissolve sugar in water in heavy pan over medium heat.  Bring to the<br>boil, add lemon juice and saffron and boil for 10 minutes.  Cool and<br>strain into a 25 cm (10 inch) pie plate.  Keep aside. Break eggs into<br>a casserole dish about 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter.  The size and<br>flat base are important. Add salt and mix eggs with fork until yolks<br>and whites are thoroughly combined - do not beat as eggs must not be<br>foamy. Heat oil in an electric frypan to 190 C (375 F) or in a 25 cm<br>(10 inch) frypan placed on a thermostatically controlled hot plate or<br>burner. Have ready nearby a long skewer, the plate of syrup, a baking<br>sheet and the nuts mixed with the cardamom. A bowl of water and a<br>cloth for drying hands are also necessary. Hold dish with eggs in one<br>hand next to the pan of oil and slightly above it. Put hand into egg,<br>palm down, so that egg covers back of hand. Lift out hand, curling<br>fingers slightly inwards, then open out over hot oil, fingers<br>pointing down.  Move hand across surface of oil so that egg falls in<br>streams from fingertips.  Dip hand in egg again and make more strands<br>across those already in pan.  Repeat 3 to 4 times until about an<br>eighth of the egg is used.  There should be a closely meshed layer of<br>egg strands about 20 cm (8 inches) across.  Work quickly so that the<br>last lot of egg is added not long after the first lot. Rinse hands<br>quickly and dry. Take skewer and slide under bubbling omelet, lift up<br>and turn over to lightly brown other side. The first side will be<br>bubbly, the underside somewhat smoother. When golden brown lift out<br>with skewer and drain over pan. Place omelet flat in the syrup, spoon<br>syrup over the top and lift out with skewer onto baking sheet. Roll<br>up with bubbly side inwards. Finish roll should be about 3 cm (1 1/4<br>inches) in diameter.  Put to one side and sprinkle with nuts. Repeat<br>with remaining egg, making 7 to 8 rolls in all. Though depth of egg<br>diminishes, you will become so adept that somehow you will get it in<br>the pan in fine strands. When cool, cut kabaubs into 4-5 cm (1 1/2 to<br>2 inch pieces and serve. These keep well in a sealed container in a<br>cool place.<br>

7 Kartoff Mumulay (Stuffed Potato Fritters) 0 Groundmeat Vegetables Jewish Afghan 1 servings STUFFING<br>POTATO FRITTERS<br>Passover is a time when the Afghan Jews must be inventive & thrifty in<br>their cooking.
