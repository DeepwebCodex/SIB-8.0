113 2017-07-31 Xerox DocuMate 6460 and 6480 Scanners Help Businesses Bridge the Path Between Paper and Digital PLEASANTON, Calif. —  
One formidable obstacle in the way of achieving the efficiency of paperless operations has been the onerous task of converting paper documents to digital files. Xerox today introduced a solution that enables large and small businesses to overcome this hurdle: the DocuMate® 6460 and 6480 compact desktop scanners designed for scanning, storing, and organizing up to 10,000 double-sided pages daily.

“The DocuMate 6460 and 6480 combine superior media handling and excellent reliability with a best-of-breed software package to help businesses optimize their business processes,” said Jamie Bsales, Director of Software Analysis for Keypoint Intelligence – Buyers Lab (BLI). “All in all, both devices are excellent choices for any business that is looking to roll out or optimize their digital transformation initiatives.”

Engineered to maximize productivity, the scanners accept up to 120 mixed sized documents – including dot matrix paper – into their document feeders and scans them in high quality 300 DPI color at speeds up to 130 double-sided pages per minute for the 6460 and 170 per minute for the 6480. At 200 DPI, those speeds increase to 140 and 176 double-sided pages per minute respectively. The small footprint of both scanners enables them to sit comfortably on any desk, making them the perfect solutions for both small and large businesses looking to digitize business-critical information.

“In today’s digital world, it’s important to be able to manage and access the data trapped in ever-increasing stacks of paper documents,” said Walt Thinfen, president and CEO at Visioneer, which makes and markets Xerox DocuMate scanners pursuant to Xerox’s quality control standards under a trademark licensing agreement with Xerox Corporation. “The DocuMate 6460 and 6480 are the ultimate point-and-click solutions that enable employees to digitize, store, and share documents and information with team members with the click of a button, leading to instant collaboration and improved productivity.”

A Better Way to Pick Paper
The DocuMate 6460 and 6480 feature Visioneer’s Active Reversing Rollers, which were recently awarded an Outstanding Achievement in Innovation by Buyer’s Lab (BLI) in the Summer 2017 Pick Awards.

“Manufacturers have designed ingenious ways to pick and feed single sheets quickly, and one of the most innovative solutions BLI technicians have seen is Visioneer’s Active Reversing Rollers,” said BLI’s Bsales. “The design has two sets of rollers that are being driven independently by two separate motors, rather than using friction or spring-loaded mechanisms to separate pages. This means the devices can be more precise when feeding pages.”

Benefits Beyond Scanning
Businesses within the banking and accounting, education, energy, financial, government, legal, healthcare, and manufacturing industries can benefit from the scanners’ features, including:

Visioneer Acuity with DriverPLUS TWAIN uses advanced algorithms to intelligently and instantly correct and improve the visual clarity of scanned documents or images containing imperfections.

Visioneer OneTouch® allows users to automatically route documents to email, printers, files on the server or to the cloud with one simple touch of a button.

“Light Jet” Technology provides 45 times more light for improved image quality, resulting in sharper images.

Wide Automatic Document Feeder for “Full Bleed” Capture when scanning color magazines full width or tractor feed paper forms with less manual preparation.

Nuance Power PDF gives users the tools they need to create, convert, edit, assemble and securely share PDF files to increase office efficiency, enhance collaboration and improve compliance.

Nuance OmniPage Ultimate is an optical character recognition and layout retention solution that quickly turns scanned documents into editable, formatted text that can be used in any word processing, desktop or web publishing program.

Nuance PaperPort is a document management tool that helps users organize, find and share documents to bring a new level of proficiency and productivity to an organization’s workflow. 1
114 2017-09-07 Xerox Offers Solutions that Connect the Physical and Digital Worlds NORWALK, Conn. —  
How can today’s commercial printers bridge the physical and digital worlds through innovative solutions in printing technology, workflow software and personalization? 

“Xerox is focused on innovations that give our customers the tools they need to grow their business and succeed in the competitive graphic communications market,” said Andrew Copley, president, Graphic Communications Solutions, Xerox. “With the speed and enhanced inline finishing capabilities of the new Versant® 3100, businesses can lower costs and turn around jobs faster; with our latest ink innovations, they can save substantially by printing directly from inkjet to offset coated stocks; and with brilliant highlights of white, dry ink they can deliver exceptional marketing materials. What attendees see at PRINT 17 from Xerox sets us apart from the competition.”

Among the products on display in the Xerox booth are three MUST SEE ‘EMS award winners – The Xerox Trivor® 2400 High Fusion Inkjet Press, the Xerox iGen® 5 Press with White Dry Ink and Xerox Specialty Imaging. The annual MUST SEE ‘EMS competition recognizes the most compelling new products.

Tweet: .@Xerox connects the physical and digital worlds with innovative solutions on display at #PRINT17. https://ctt.ec/Nba7b+

The Trivor 2400 High Fusion Inkjet Press allows print providers to produce high-quality results direct to offset coated paper without any intermediate paper coatings, primers or specialty hardware.
 
The iGen 5 Press with White Dry Ink enables the application of white on colored or transparent stocks, opening up a new set of application opportunities. Specialty Imaging helps to protect against counterfeiting with exclusive fraud-resistant printed effects, for both static and variable information jobs.

The Xerox Brenva® HD Production Inkjet Press: Two new feeding and finishing options have been announced: a Tecnau Roll Feeder and an inline square fold finisher, the CP Bourg PowerSquare 224. These options extend the value of the press and help drive additional efficiencies by delivering hours of uninterrupted print time. Additionally, the press has been updated with two new automated quality control checks to assure maximum uptime.

The Xerox Rialto® 900 Inkjet Press: With a new inline dynamic perforator and a second-high capacity stacker, print providers can maximize press availability and expand into new high value application segments.

The Xerox Versant 3100 Press: Printing at speeds up to 100 pages per minute on stocks up to 350 gsm, the new Versant 3100 offers high image quality and performance along with advanced inline finishing capabilities.

Xerox FreeFlow® Digital Publisher Version 3.0: The solution offers new templates and an updated web reader to provide an intuitive, more consistent reading experience across web browsers and mobile devices. The new article layout templates provide more design choices, while the new web reader enhances the reading experience of documents, back issues, social media sharing and more. With these updates, print service providers have more flexibility to meet demanding requirements of end clients.

Personalization solutions: XMPie®, A Xerox Company, will be demonstrating a new VIPP-to-PDF/VT processing capability to its PersonalEffect® suite of software offerings along with Omnichannel A/B, a new capability that applies A/B testing to batch email touchpoints in a multichannel communications campaign. 1
115 2017-10-25 Xerox Recognized for Innovative Approaches to Cyber Security OCT 25, 2017 — SOFTWARE, SOLUTIONS
Norwalk, Conn. —  
The Xerox Global Security Services group has been selected as a recipient of the sixth annual CSO50 Awards for its efforts to make information security an integral part of communicating with employees, partners and stakeholders.

“The future of cyber safety is a moving target and we need to be aware of how the threat landscape is changing and adapting to new securities. We call this the Cognitive Security Approach at Xerox”, says Alissa Johnson, chief information security officer, Xerox. “The flexibility and agility needed for our enterprise to combat cyber threats in real-time will be critical to our future role in The Internet of things.”

Two Xerox information projects, “Changing Team Culture using QwikSolver®”, and “Xerox Enterprise Cyber Threat Management Portal,” were recognized as security initiatives that demonstrate outstanding business value and thought leadership.

Changing Team Culture using QwikSolver
Xerox designed a new internal process called QwikSolver to address decisions that had to be made quickly and without compromising the information safety of customers. As security employees were trained to use the QwikSolver process, the company experienced positive cultural changes and uncompromised information security.

Xerox Enterprise Cyber Threat Management Portal
In response to newly emerging cyber-attacks, customers, partners, executives, and shareholders expect enterprises to demonstrate awareness of threats and the actions they undertake to thwart them. The Xerox Cyber Threat Management Portal meets that demand by providing a means for Xerox Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team to directly share information with these audiences. Cyber-threat preparedness and training functions are available to anyone to learn cyber-threat response procedures, and industry threat terms and concepts. The portal also provides continuous tracking, measurement, and reporting of enterprise-wide responses to threats directly relevant to the business. 

The level of transparency Xerox shows to its customers, partners, executives, and shareholders regarding its awareness and approaches to cybersecurity allow all groups to rest assured this topic is at the forefront of all activity.

The awards will be presented to the Xerox Global Security Services group and Chief Information Security Officer Alissa Johnson at the CSO 50 Conference + Awards in February 2018.

116 2017-10-23 Apps Take Center Stage at Xerox Channel Partners’ Personalized Application Builder Forum Event helped dozens of global channel partners build, price and market custom apps for Xerox ConnectKey workplace assistants

OCT 23, 2017 — SOLUTIONS, MANAGED PRINT SERVICES, COPYING, MULTIFUNCTION, PRINTING, SOFTWARE
NORWALK, Conn. —  
For Xerox channel partners looking to increase recurring revenue and maximize value to clients, there was an app event for that.

The Xerox Personalized Application Builder Forum drew 50 high-potential partners from across the globe, and the collaborative format included perspectives from their peers and Xerox. Attendees learned about the value of developing and selling apps, and how those apps can turn multifunction printers (MFPs) into smart, connected workplace assistants.

Held Oct. 18-19 at Xerox’s Gil Hatch Center for Customer Innovation in Webster, N.Y., the event was designed for partners of all sizes, and regardless of their experience in the app space. The two-day agenda covered:

How to get started – benefits of the Xerox Personalized Application Builder program; skills needed to initiate development; and understanding the Xerox App Gallery and Xerox App Studio, sites where partners can access and market apps.
App development – ideas for new apps and top areas for app growth.
Promotion – how partners can maximize and market their presence as app developers.
Monetization – how to price apps, and the different models for client implementation.
Xerox tools and support – an overview of training support and hardware and software tools that help partners efficiently create apps.
Xerox executives led keynote sessions focused on a partner’s progression from technology reseller to software developer; how to unleash innovation within an organization and Xerox’s view of the app landscape. A partner showcase featured partner-developed apps, both to inspire and generate business from other attendees.

Just-Tech, a Maryland-based print, network, IT and apps solutions company, has developed and sold custom apps for Xerox’s ConnectKey® devices for the past two years, with apps accounting for 10 percent of the company’s revenue. Just-Tech president Joshua Justice hopes to double or even triple app sales next year, and attended the event seeking ideas to help fuel that growth, and share his experience with other partners.

“Our app sales keep growing and we continue to reinvest,” said Justice. “Apps are a competitive differentiator for us and have taken us global. This is the type of collaborative gathering that will help other Xerox channel partners do the same.”

The Rite Group, a Missouri-based IT services provider, left the event eager to explore app development opportunities.

“Software development is a natural progression for our business, but we weren’t sure where to start,” said T. Robin Cole, CEO of The Rite Group. “Hearing from organizations that have experienced a similar transition and pursued comparable opportunities was invaluable in helping define our strategy. I’m energized and excited to take the next step.”

Xerox Extensible Interface Platform allows partners and developers to easily create personalized apps that can be accessed on the MFP's tablet-like screen. Partners are also given access to application program interfaces for managed print services, production systems Xerox FreeFlow® and Xerox DocuShare®, enabling partners to create custom applications that leverage the range of Xerox’s industry-leading product portfolio.

“Apps have permeated our personal lives and the workplace is following suit,” said Tracey Koziol, senior vice president, Workplace Solutions Business Group, Xerox. “The opportunity for Xerox and our partners is boundless, and this event served as a catalyst for future development.” Koziol was among the event’s featured speakers.

118 2017-12-12 Xerox Ranks Among Nation’s Best in Measures that Matter Most to People and Communities DEC 12, 2017 — CORPORATE, CITIZENSHIP, ENVIRONMENT, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Norwalk, Conn. —  
In a head to head comparison of the largest publicly traded corporations nationwide, Xerox (NYSE: XRX) was recognized for outperforming its peers in a number of areas including worker pay and treatment, job creation, community involvement and providing products that improve life and do not harm the environment. Xerox was named one of America’s most JUST companies according to a survey conducted by Forbes and JUST Capital, a nonprofit that ranks the largest publicly traded corporations in the U.S.

The JUST 100 rankings are based on one of the most comprehensive surveys ever conducted on public attitudes towards corporate behavior, involving 10,000 American respondents in 2017 and more than 72,000 over the past three years. The criteria for the list is based upon JUST Capital’s research into the issues that Americans care about most.

For the complete 2017 JUST 100 list, please visit: www.forbes.com/just100.

“We believe that the best companies are those that balance the needs of all stakeholders and add value to the communities in which they operate,” said Xerox CEO Jeff Jacobson. “We put a critical focus on ensuring that the hard work of Xerox people helps our customers and the well-being of the planet.”

The JUST Capital rankings encompass the 1,000 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. The survey ranks how companies perform overall, how they compare by industry, and how they rank on specific themes such as worker compensation and well-being, customer treatment, product impacts, environmental footprint, supporting communities, generating jobs, behaving responsibly in sourcing and supply chains, and more. The JUST 100 list of the top 100 companies across all industries, as well as the 33 top performers by industry, will be featured in the December 26, 2017 issue of Forbes magazine, with additional feature stories at www.forbes.com/just100.

“Business can and should be a unifying force for good in America today, but what it needs is a new North Star” said Martin Whittaker, CEO of JUST Capital. “That is what these rankings represent. By trusting in the American people to define what really matters when it comes to measuring business performance, we think we can help breathe life into the vision of a more just economy that better serves the broader best interests of society.”

“The second annual JUST 100 list serves as a report card for corporate America, providing unbiased data about how corporations are performing on the issues Americans care most about,” said Forbes editor Randall Lane. “At a time when corporate America, as a whole, faces low public approval, the companies in the JUST 100 provide an example for their peers on how to win back the trust of the American people.”

119 2018-01-03 Xerox AltaLink Devices Achieve Common Criteria Certification First to receive industry’s most stringent information technology security standard certification from National Information Assurance Partnership
DEC 08, 2017 — MULTIFUNCTION, COPYING, PRINTING, SOFTWARE, SOLUTIONS
Norwalk, Conn. —  
Xerox’s (NYSE: XRX) AltaLink® devices are the first multifunction printers (MFPs) to be certified by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) under rigorous new testing standards.

The Xerox AltaLink devices received NIAP certification against the latest Common Criteria security protection profile for hardcopy devices. This new protection profile is based on the security requirements specified by United States and Japanese government agencies. NIAP is the U.S. government organization that ensures compliance with the global Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation.

The Protection Profile for Hardcopy Devices v1.0 (HCD-PP v1.0) intends to protect the information processed by an MFP from security threats and includes stringent new requirements for cryptography, authentication and secure protocols. Testing is done in independent labs and results in the most up-to-date and stringent security endorsement for small- and medium-size businesses, large enterprises and governments.

Tweet: .@Xerox AltaLink devices are first #MFPs to receive Common Criteria certification from NIAP, assuring customers of world-class security protection built-in. https://ctt.ec/7zj2_+

“Detecting and preventing cyber threats is a 24/7, 365 days a year requirement for all enterprises and a fundamental focus for Xerox,” said Tracey Koziol, senior vice president, Workplace Solutions Business Group, Xerox. “NIAP and Common Criteria Certification gives our customers – particularly federal government agencies – assurance that our new AltaLink devices have world-class security protection built-in, and that their critical information is safe.”

AltaLink series and Xerox’s approach to device security
The Xerox ConnectKey® technology-enabled AltaLink series includes 10 MFPs designed for enterprises of all sizes with medium and large workgroups. ConnectKey technology transforms traditional printing devices into smart, connected workplace assistants that reflect the evolving needs of today’s businesses. They include simple and secure on-the-go capabilities, cloud connectivity, and access to productivity boosting features and apps. 

Xerox security solutions span four key aspects in a multilayered approach: intrusion prevention, device detection, document and data detection, and external partnerships. An example of an external partnership is McAfee’s whitelisting technology, which constantly monitors and automatically protects against malware and comes embedded in all Xerox AltaLink products. When services and solutions are required to complement Xerox’s secure devices, managed print services offerings continue the security philosophy with an approach that prevents, detects, protects and reports.

Other recent Xerox security accolades
The Xerox Global Security Services group was recently selected as a recipient of a CSO50 Award for its efforts to make information security an integral part of communicating with employees, partners and stakeholders.

Xerox was recently named a leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Security Solutions and Services Hardcopy 2017 Vendor Assessment report for its commitment to enterprise security and its broad portfolio of print and document security solutions. The report notes that Xerox has robust print and document security solutions in the form of tools, methodologies and services configured to meet individual customer IT strategy needs, including data, documents, devices, rules, and regulations governing both business and individual use cases.

Xerox also was a recent recipient of the KeyPoint Intelligence – Buyers Lab 2017-2018 PaceSetter Award for Leadership in Document Imaging Security.

JAN 31, 2018 — CORPORATE
NORWALK, Conn. and TOKYO —  
 

Xerox shareholders to receive a $2.5 billion special cash dividend, or approximately $9.80 per share1, and 49.9% of the combined company; Fujifilm to own 50.1%

Combined company to deliver at least $1.7 billion in total cost savings, with $1.2 billion to be achieved by 2020

Accelerates path to revenue growth through global reach, industry-leading scale and enhanced innovation capabilities

Well-positioned to lead in growing business areas such as high-speed inkjet, industrial print and workplace solutions, while leveraging Fujifilm's extensive technologies

Combined company will have enhanced financial flexibility for future growth investments and capital returns

Combined company will have dual headquarters in Norwalk, CT, U.S. and Minato, Tokyo, Japan, and will maintain the iconic “Xerox” and “Fuji Xerox” brands within its respective operating regions

FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (“Fujifilm”) (TSE: 4901) and Xerox Corporation (“Xerox”) (NYSE: XRX) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine Xerox and their longstanding Fuji Xerox joint venture. The combined company will be a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions with annual revenues of $18 billion and leadership positions in key geographic regions.           

This proposed combination provides Xerox shareholders with significant cash at closing, as well as a substantial interest in the significantly enhanced combined company. Under the terms of the agreement, Xerox shareholders will receive a $2.5 billion special cash dividend, or approximately $9.80 per share1, funded from the combined company’s balance sheet, and own 49.9% of the combined company at closing. The cash dividend represents more than 30% of Xerox’s unaffected share price of $30.35 based on closing share price as of January 10, 2018. Fujifilm will own 50.1% of the combined company and provide important operational support and transformational leadership.

The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Fujifilm and Xerox. The combined company will be named “Fuji Xerox” and trade on the NYSE under the ticker XRX. The new Fuji Xerox will have dual headquarters in Norwalk, CT, U.S. and in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, with presence in over 180 countries. The combined company will go to market and maintain the iconic “Xerox” and “Fuji Xerox” brands within its respective operating regions.

Shigetaka Komori, chairman and chief executive officer of Fujifilm, said, “Fujifilm and Xerox have fostered an exceptional partnership through our existing Fuji Xerox joint venture, and this transaction is a strategic evolution of our alliance. The Document Solutions business represents a significant part of Fujifilm’s portfolio, and the creation of the new Fuji Xerox allows us to more directly establish a leadership position in a fast-changing market. We believe Fujifilm’s track record of advancing technology in innovative imaging and information solutions – especially in inkjet, imaging, and AI areas – will be important components of the success of the new Fuji Xerox.”

Mr. Komori added, “I am confident that Fujifilm’s ability to drive change as well as its experience of successful reinvention will give a competitive edge to the new Fuji Xerox, delivering significant value creation to shareholders of both the new Fuji Xerox and Fujifilm. We are delighted to welcome Xerox and its employees to the Fujifilm family and look forward to combining our strengths towards jointly shaping the future of our industry.”

Jeff Jacobson, chief executive officer of Xerox, said, “The proposed combination has compelling industrial logic and will unlock significant growth and productivity opportunities for the combined company, while delivering substantial value to Xerox shareholders. The new Fuji Xerox will be better positioned to compete in today’s environment with truly global scale, increased presence in fast-growing markets, and innovation capabilities to effectively meet our customers’ rapidly-evolving demands. In addition, the combined company’s strong financial profile will enable investments that support continued market leadership, while also providing opportunities for increasing capital returns over time.”

Robert J. Keegan, chairman of Xerox’s Board of Directors, said, “Today’s announcement follows a comprehensive review of our strategic and financial alternatives led by Xerox’s independent directors that began after the separation of Conduent in 2016. Upon careful consideration of all alternatives available to the company, the Board of Directors concluded that this combination is clearly the best path to create value for our shareholders. An attractive, certain cash dividend, together with participation in the future success of the combined company, presents a compelling value equation for Xerox shareholders. We are excited to strengthen our longstanding relationship with Fujifilm as we enter the next phase of Xerox’s transformation journey.”

Clear Leader in Innovative Print Technologies and Intelligent Work Solutions
Xerox shareholders will have the opportunity to participate in the new Fuji Xerox’s accelerated revenue trajectory and long-term value creation potential. The transaction builds on the 56-year collaborative history between Fujifilm and Xerox to create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions with enhanced scale and innovation capabilities:

Global leader with combined revenue of approximately $18 billion and nearly $120 billion total addressable opportunity.

Enhanced scale with presence in over 180 countries and covering key geographies including North America, Japan, Europe, Asia Pacific and China.

Combined leadership with a strong track record of operational excellence, transformation experience, customer relationships and industry expertise.

Improved revenue profile and growth trajectory by leveraging the combined expertise, competitive strengths and geographic reach of the two companies.

World-class innovation capabilities to define the future of innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions by bringing together two R&D and innovation leaders, along with Fujifilm’s extensive expertise. The new Fuji Xerox will be well-positioned to lead in growing areas such as high-speed inkjet, packaging, industrial print and workplace automation, as well as future development opportunities in artificial intelligence, machine learning, internet of things and augmented reality.

Strengthened balance sheet and cash flow generation to provide flexibility to support strategic investments in growth and enable increasing capital returns.

Significant Value Creation Opportunity
This highly synergistic combination is expected to deliver at least $1.7 billion in total annual cost savings by 2022, with approximately $1.2 billion of the total cost savings expected to be achieved by 2020. The targeted cost savings represent approximately 10% of the total cost base of the new Fuji Xerox and will drive significant margin expansion over the next four years. 

Of the total $1.7 billion cost savings, $1.25 billion is related to the synergies that will be achieved through the transaction. In addition, the combined company will benefit from a cost reduction program commencing immediately at the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture, which is targeted to generate approximately $450 million of cost savings on an annualized basis. These amounts are incremental to Xerox’s ongoing Strategic Transformation initiatives. The new company expects to incur approximately $1.4 billion in one-time integration and restructuring costs, mainly in the first three years.

The new Fuji Xerox will also have significant revenue synergy opportunities over time as it capitalizes on its global reach, industry-leading scale and enhanced innovation capabilities. Importantly, the combined company will have an increased total addressable opportunity estimated at nearly $120 billion and a strong presence in attractive growth markets, allowing the new company to become more competitive and better able to serve customers and business partners globally.

Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. (“Fuji Xerox”) is a joint venture between Xerox Corporation and Fujifilm in which Xerox holds a noncontrolling 25% equity interest and Fujifilm holds the remaining equity interest. In April 2017, Fujifilm formed an independent investigation committee (“IIC”) to primarily conduct a review of the appropriateness of the accounting practices at Fuji Xerox’s New Zealand subsidiary and at other subsidiaries. The IIC completed its review during the second quarter 2017 and identified aggregate adjustments to Fuji Xerox’s financial statements of approximately JPY 40 billion (approximately $360 million) primarily related to misstatements at Fuji Xerox’s New Zealand and Australian subsidiaries. We determined that our share of the total adjustments identified as part of the investigation was approximately $90 million and impacted our fiscal years 2009 through 2017. We concluded that we should revise our previously issued annual and interim consolidated financial statements for 2014, 2015 and 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 the next time they are filed. Our review of this matter has been completed. However, Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox continue to review Fujifilm’s oversight and governance of Fuji Xerox as well as Fuji Xerox’s oversight and governance over its businesses in light of the findings of the IIC. At this time, we can provide no assurances relative to the outcome of any potential governmental investigations or any consequences thereof that may happen as a result of this matter.

122 2018-02-21 Xerox Prioritized for Authorization from U.S. Government for Cloud-based Managed Print Services NORWALK, Conn. —  
Federal Government agencies can soon hire Xerox knowing its Managed Print Services (MPS) solutions have been carefully pre-vetted and approved. Xerox has achieved in-process status for the U.S. government’s Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). This process signals that Xerox is FedRAMP ready and has been prioritized by the Joint Advisory Board – the last step before full FedRAMP authorization. The move by the government reinforces Xerox’s leadership in cloud-based MPS security and workflow automation.

The FedRAMP program standardizes security assessment, authorization and monitoring for cloud products and services government-wide. Cloud service providers authorized through FedRAMP are included on a centralized list accessible by all federal agencies. By using a cloud service provider from the list, federal agencies can eliminate the time-consuming, research-intensive process of vetting MPS products for purchase such as automatic supplies replenishment, print awareness and productivity and fleet management of multi-vendor printers and multifunction printers.

“Xerox has its roots in the cloud. Our MPS toolset was established in the cloud and features plug-and-play connectivity with go to market and delivery partners globally,” said Ted Dezvane, senior vice president, Managed Document Services – Commercial Excellence, Xerox. “And now, we are in the process of making a key addition to our cloud capabilities – Xerox MPS for U.S. Federal Government.”
