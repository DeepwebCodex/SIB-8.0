4 Lungu Dan <p>Sometimes it just so happens that people mistake me for Dan Lungu, the writer. Not that I mind, but they ask me to speak in his name. I try to say clever things, I try not to disgrace him, especially when people say he&rsquo;s a nice guy. Over time, I said a lot of things about him: that he allegedly likes marigold infusion, sociology and antiquities. Sometimes it&rsquo;s possible that I contradicted myself, but nobody is that interested in the lives of writers. Strangely though, when I get depressed I actually think that I am Dan Lungu, the writer. Then, I start writing and the depression goes away.</p> <p><strong>Dan Lungu</strong>&nbsp;was born in 1969. He is the director of the Museum of Romanian Literature in Jassy and one of the best loved and most translated contemporary Romanian writers. He is a member of the Union of Romanian Writers.

5 Florian Filip <p>These days, I swear I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to say about myself. At forty, it has become clear to me that I&rsquo;m never going to be a football player, I&rsquo;m beginning to lose hope that I&rsquo;ll ever have long hair, I wake up increasingly early in the morning, I eat unbelievably few cherries (which I once cherished), I smoke unbelievably many cigarettes (which I once despised), truth seems to me quite questionable and the weather forecasts leave me cold. Fortunately, though not as strongly as I used to, I still believe that one day I&rsquo;m going to catch a twenty-kilo sheatfish.</p> <p><strong>Filip Florian </strong>(b. 16 May 1968, Bucharest) &ndash; between 1990-99, he worked as a journalist and editor for the <em>Cuvintul</em> (<em>The Word</em>) weekly and then as a correspondent for the Free Europe and Deutsche Welle radio stations. He spent five years in the mountain town of Sinaia writing his first novel <em>Little Fingers</em>, which was published to great critical acclaim by Polirom in 2005. Greeted as the work of a distinctive and original new voice, the novel was awarded the <em>Romania literara</em> (<em>Literary Romania</em>) magazine Prize for Debut, the Romanian Writers&rsquo; Union Prize for Best Prose Debut, and the National Union of Employers Prize for Excellence. Together with Matei Florian, his younger brother, Filip Florian published the unusual dialogic novel <em>The Baiut Alley Lads</em> (Polirom, 2006), also warmly praised by critics and the reading public alike. In 2007, second editions of both books were printed. <em>Little Fingers</em> has been published in Hungary (Magvet&ouml;, 2008), Germany (Suhrkamp, 2008), Poland (Czarne, 2008), Spain (Acantilado, 2009) and the USA (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009), and will be published in Italy (Fazi), Slovenia (Didakta) and Slovakia (Kalligram). <em>The Baiut Alley Lads</em> has been published in Poland (Czarne, 2009), the UK (Plymouth University Press, 2010), Spain (Acantilado), and Bulgaria (Panorama +). <em>The Days of the King</em> has been published in Hungary (Magvet&ouml;, 2009), and was published in the USA in 2011 (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt).</p> imagini/autori/5_20130116145239.jpg Florian Filip
6 Florian Matei <p>Quasi-thin intellectual with longish bone structure and a relaxed look, former football player within the schoolyard and author of numerous executions crossbar-goal, of outstanding merits and far-reaching principles, wants to meet lady tranquility for the transaction of a beautiful novel. Posterity, multiple adjectives and matter-of-fact adverbs guaranteed.</p> <p><strong>Matei Florian </strong>(b. 1979) He made his literary debut in 1997, publishing a number of poems in &quot;Cuv&icirc;ntul&quot; magazine. In 1998, he became a reporter for &quot;Dilema&quot; magazine (now renamed &quot;Dilema Veche&quot;), for which he later started writing his own regular column. He has contributed reportages, literary reviews and short plays to the cultural press and radio. In 2008, he was awarded the Music Criticism Prize at the Gala of Romanian Cultural Journalism. His debut as a novelist was <em>The Bãiu&#355; Alley Lads </em>(Polirom, 2006; 2nd edition, 2007), co-written with his brother, Filip Florian. The novel was greeted with critical acclaim and was a great success with the Romanian reading public. The book&rsquo;s Romanian success also piqued the interest of a number of European publishing houses, and it is now in press in Poland (Czarne), Spain (Acantilado) and Bulgaria (Panorama+). The novel <em>Both Hams And Regretel</em>, published in 2009, has reconfirmed Matei Florian&rsquo;s literary talent, and has been widely praised in the Romanian cultural sphere.</p>

10 Teodorovici Lucian Dan <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think a combination of circumstances drives a man to write, as much as it drives him to become an actor or a locksmith. All things can be done with passion. My combination of circumstances was, I suppose, the fortune of having had a grandfather who told stories so charmingly that all my kinsmen used to come and listen to him. I also happened to grow up in a house full of books, to have a mother who loved buying me books... And that's all.</p>

11 Ernu Vasile <p>I often have the feeling that I&rsquo;m the product of some dreams which, accidently, are mine. I often mistake my biography with my bibliography and I mix these two with innocence and a remarkable pleasure. I intervene in these dreams to modify and reshape them to my liking. In order to be successful I try to retell and rewrite them. Every time I do that, something else comes out. Regardless of the outcome, I always start again in the hope that I&rsquo;ll reach a &bdquo;final&rdquo; result.

13 Adamesteanu Gabriela <p>They say that I have one of the finest  &quot;ears&quot; in Romanian literature, because I have given a voice to each of my characters. I think that my &quot;ear&quot; came about because I lived in an isolated country, I wrote far from the literary world, and I never thought I would see my books in translation, no more than I thought of going to Mars.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Gabriela  Adamesteanu</strong>, novelist, essayist and journalist.

(Bulgaria), Czarne (Poland), Gruppo Editoriale Zonza (Italy), Apollon Yayincilik (Turkey), Kastaniotis (Greece) <p>The profound premise of Dan Lungu&rsquo;s novel resides in an examination of the following paradox: how is it possible that many, even very many, people who formerly lived under a totalitarian, inhuman regime, without having enjoyed privileges or favours, can now be capable of nostalgia ? The author, through the intermediary of an old woman, who relates her life in the first person, attempts to deconstruct the mechanisms of nostalgia and to unravel this psychological enigma.</p>
<p>The novel is set ten years after the fall of the Ceau&#351;escu dictatorship and shortly before the general elections. Emilia Apostoae, a pensioner, the greater part of whose life has been lived under the &rdquo;people&rsquo;s regime&rdquo;, receives a telephone call from Alice, her daughter, an immigrant in Canada, who urges her mother &rdquo;not to vote for the former communists&rdquo;. This telephone call, followed by other arguments, casts Emilia into a veritable crisis of identity, from which she tries to save herself by recollecting the past and seeking to justify her nostalgia in her own eyes and those of her daughter. We thus go back to her childhood and adolescence during the time of the dictatorship ; we enter the rhythms and problems of daily life during that epoch.</p>
<p>The story moves at a brisk pace, the dialogue is engaging, humour shows its fangs, and mindsets are revelead by degrees. Apparently simple occurrences progressively develop their power of suggestion and range. Little by little, we are presented with a &rdquo;normality&rdquo; constructed by the regime and decanted in time, a normality that stirs regrets in Emilia but chills the reader. Dan Lungu does not accuse, but rather is empathetic : he describes the atrocity of an evil that has become banal, while at the same time being attentive to the dignity of his characters. His writing is rich in significant and redolent detail, but it does not even for a moment lose sight of the broader picture.</p>
<p>The novel continues the &lsquo;experiment in mentality&rsquo; begun by Dan Lungu in <i>Hens&rsquo; Heaven</i> &ndash; the descent into a communism residual not at the political or social level but at the level of an ordinary person who has lived through that system and been profoundly marked by it. <i>I&rsquo;m a Communist Biddy</i> <i>! </i>forces you to smile, to laugh uproariously, to grow sad, but above all to interrupt your reading for a few moments and go outside in order to convince yourself that reality is otherwise, that people are otherwise. However, after such an exercise, the only thing left will be for you to conclude that the author has met the old woman who is a neighbour in your block, that he has met her daughter who has emigrated to Canada, that he has met your former workmate who used to tell political jokes while at the same time informing on you to the secret police behind your back. And then he wrote this book precisely in order to hold a mirror up to us all, in which we can see ourselves as we are and as, more often than not, we should not like to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m a Communist Biddy !</em>&rdquo; is more than the tale of an old woman : it is a museum on paper of daily life in a totalitarian society, a compendium of political humour, a lesson about the incommensurability of human experiences and, why not, the unpredictable story of an abstention from the vote.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s nine in the morning and we&rsquo;re working like daft. We&rsquo;re giving it our all, so that we can take it easy after the break. The doorbell, loud and hoarse, like a hooter, informs us that there&rsquo;s someone at the door, a stranger. The bolt is drawn and the foreman appears, with a face like a funeral. Next to him, an elegant bloke holding a cigarette, none too jolly either. Aurelia whispers to me that it&rsquo;s the new director. I heard a few months ago that they&rsquo;d changed the director, but I hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to see his mug until now. Shaven to the bone, with an impeccable haircut, but forbidding at first sight. I&rsquo;m thinking that the foreman is in hot water or that one of us has put our foot in it, really deep, if the director has condescended to take his fancy suit for a walk among our greasy overalls. Comrade Suit puts his hands over his ears and scrunches up his eyes, and the foreman makes a sign for us to shut down the machinery. As soon as you can hear yourself think, the foreman tells us to gather around, because the comrade director general has an announcement for us. We form a circle around him. Comrade Suit stubs out his cigarette end with the toe of his 420&#8209;lei&#8209;a&#8209;pair shoe, clasps his hands together, and lets rip, solemnly :<br />
&ldquo;Dear comrades, I have some good news for us all. Because your workshop has for many years been foremost in &lsquo;Socialist Competition&rsquo;, the comrades from the County branch of the Party have entrusted us with a lofty and privileged mission.&rdquo;<br />
We&rsquo;re obviously in for it now, I tell myself. They&rsquo;re probably going to increase our hours.<br />
&ldquo;A mission of which we should be proud. That of presenting and making known the fruits of our labour at the highest level possible, to comrade Nicolae Ceau&#351;escu...&rdquo;<br />
Blah, blah, blah. We all freeze to the spot. In three days, Ceau&#351;escu is going to visit our workshop, to stimulate production for export.<br />
&ldquo;Please start preparing for this edifying moment immediately !&rdquo; the director concludes his speech.<br />
This means military discipline, we all know it.<br />
Gaffer Mitu has a pasteurised look about him, as he himself says. Either he&rsquo;s got a hangover, or his morning dose of holy water was a bit too large.<br />
The foreman tries to obtain a day&rsquo;s delay from the director, before commencing the cleanup, because we have to finish an order for Thailand. Any delay will result in docked wages.<br />
&ldquo;Comrade, Ceau&#351;escu is coming, don&rsquo;t you understand ? Is export what matters to us now ?&rdquo; the director snaps at him, lighting another cigarette.<br />
They both go out, and we remain, pensive.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;On my life, I won&rsquo;t budge until I take a photo of Ceau&#351;escu right here next to my lathe, says gaffer Mitu, chewing his words.<br />
&ldquo;Gaffer Mitu, if Ceau&#351;escu shakes hands with you, you won&rsquo;t wash until your dying day,&rdquo; gaffer Pancu goads him.<br />
&ldquo;Noooo, I want a kiss from Lena. I&rsquo;m going to dress up as a pioneer and give her flowers, just so she&rsquo;ll give me a peck on the cheek.&rdquo;<br />
We all laugh, but without pleasure.<br />
The foreman comes back sharpish. He reads gaffer Mitu at a glance and sends him off to sleep for an hour. He hasn&rsquo;t managed to budge the director on a delay, so we all get ready to make everywhere squeaky clean. He warns us that if we don&rsquo;t make a good job of it, we&rsquo;ll all be in the lurch. The director, especially given that he&rsquo;s new, is also quaking in his underpants, so he&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on us in the days to come. In three days and three nights we&rsquo;ll have to sort out everything that hasn&rsquo;t been repaired or cleaned for the last twenty years. If need be, we&rsquo;ll work in shifts. We won&rsquo;t be alone, because the entire factory will be in on the act. Our workshop has been picked out, but you never know where Ceau&#351;escu will have a mind to poke his nose in. I&rsquo;ve never seen the foreman so agitated. He&rsquo;s talking and walking among us. He&rsquo;s thinking out loud. He&rsquo;s giving orders for today and the following days.<br />
He changes his mind. He contradicts himself. He stutters.<br />
He&rsquo;s in a panic !<br />
In the end, we manage to get ourselves organised somewhat. We decide to start with the whitewashing, because that makes the most mess. Then we&rsquo;ll go on to painting everything that hasn&rsquo;t seen a paintbrush for years, cleaning the windows, polishing the machinery, and after that we&rsquo;ll see.<br />
The scurrying begins. At first we all get under each other&rsquo;s feet, but little by little we each settle down to business. Where they&rsquo;ve passed by with the whitewash, Aurelia and me clean up the splashes and do the windows. Sanda couldn&rsquo;t be luckier &ndash; she&rsquo;s on maternity leave.<br />
It&rsquo;s afternoon already and things are progressing nicely, but we&rsquo;re far from having finished. We&rsquo;ve only had a quarter of an hour break. My back is aching and my hands are stinging. At first, me and Aurelia chatted about this and that, but now we&rsquo;re working in silence. The only thing you can hear is the swishing of the brush and the creaking of the windows.<br />
From the storeroom appear two women with piles of overalls and all kinds of protective gear. We receive new kit. On the day of the visit we&rsquo;ll have to look like in the textbook, as the foreman says. With helmets and goggles, with gloves and leather aprons where the case.<br />
On this occasion, the boss decrees a break. He sends someone to buy food for all the others. Plus mineral water, in spite of some murmured protests. He brings the coffee from his own office.<br />
Each person has to sign for the new kit. For the first time ever, the people from stores have the patience to let us try the gear on. Up to now, they always used to give us it and that would be that. If it was too small or too large, you would have to pester them for a week before they would change it for you. We lay out the table for everyone, and we go off one at a time and come back with our effects under our arm. We munch without speaking, lost in our own thoughts.<br />
Gaffer Mitu appears, with a helmet on his head, goggles, apron and bulky pigskin gloves. He walks swaying, with his arms spread out in front of him, as though he wanted to throttle somebody.<br />
&ldquo;My name is Dumitru Prunariu,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the first Romanian in space. At this solemn moment, I want to convey to you greetings from our Martian friends.&rdquo;<br />
I take advantage of the moment of relaxation to make a phone call to Tzucu and tell him I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll be getting back. He&rsquo;s just got in, immediately after Alice, and is warming up the dinner. I explain to him what it&rsquo;s all about and he says he knows about Ceau&#351;escu&rsquo;s visit, that they have been mobilised too, and that he&rsquo;ll tell me all about it at home. Today they got away quickly, but tomorrow looks set to be grim. I ask him to take Alice round to Sanda&rsquo;s, for a day or two, until the storm passes. It&rsquo;s not the first time the lass has stayed at her auntie&rsquo;s, because they get on really well.<br />
The street is all a bustle too. Barrels of tar are boiling, and the tipper trucks are unloading asphalt. Down the hill, the steamrollers are already at work. At last, they are laying some asphalt round here. Up to now, you had to do the slalom in the car just to avoid the potholes. By the entrance on the hill, the tall dusty pines are being washed with a hose. Next to our fence, facing the street, mounds of black earth are being carried off in buckets. The gravel and dry grass disappear, and here and there flowerbeds are being made. The watchmen are painting the large gate at the vehicles entrance.<br />
The other sections aren&rsquo;t sitting idle either. Everyone is on the move. Inside, they have already gone on to painting. In the first place, the flange that runs around the workshop, then we go on to the metal parts, the posts and all the rest. Everything in green. Although the windows are wide open, the smell is making us dizzy.<br />
It&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock at night and, the same as everywhere else in town, the power has been cut off.<br />
We light a few lanterns, but you can&rsquo;t see much. The foreman is in despair. He&rsquo;s talking on the phone in his office. He&rsquo;s roaring :<br />
&ldquo;Ceau&#351;escu is coming, don&rsquo;t you understand ? Turn the power on, otherwise it will be you who has to answer for it.&rdquo;<br />
We wait. We&rsquo;re exhausted. The boss keeps making phone calls. Not even gaffer Mitu has any more appetite for jokes.<br />
At last, the electricity comes back on and, with difficulty, we start work again. We don&rsquo;t make much headway. He leaves us to it for another hour and then lets us go home. When I get back, Tzucu is asleep. I don&rsquo;t wake him. I fall asleep like a log.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here we are the next day, at the crack of dawn. Among us, two unknown persons in new overalls. The foreman makes the introductions, glumly :<br />
&ldquo;These are your new colleagues. They are called Andrei and Maria. They will be the workers&rsquo; representatives in the official delegation that will accompany the comrade President. Now they will give us a helping hand and familiarise themselves with the workplace.&rdquo;<br />
Andrei is athletic, with short hair. Judging from his jaw, I would sooner see him in shorts and boxing gloves than in overalls. Maria is very pretty, just right for handing over flowers.<br />
The plan for today is as follows : in the morning we&rsquo;ll finish painting inside and polish all the machinery until you can see you face in it, and in the afternoon we&rsquo;ll move on to fixing up the exterior. I&rsquo;m in the same team as Aurelia again. We start on the machinery. We remove the oil&#8209;soaked dust from all the crannies, scrub with emery paper, and buff with felt. The boss passes it on, from one to another, for us to mind what we say in front of the new pair. There wasn&rsquo;t any need to tell us. The hardest will be for gaffer Mitu, who has a bit of a loose tongue. <br />
I peek from the corner of my eye at our new workmates. Andrei is looking at a lathe like it&rsquo;s a giraffe, and it&rsquo;s as though Maria is holding a hedgehog not a rag.<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to change your trade from one day to the next,&rdquo; I whisper to Aurelia.<br />
Aurelia laughs to herself.<br />
Comrade Suit passes by to see how the work is going and to encourage us.<br />
At one point, Maria comes over to us. She asks us for a plaster, because she has got a blister from the emery paper. She has delicate hands, but the nails are not polished. I bring her a roll of leucoplast from the first aid kit, to cut off as much as she wants. She asks us if we usually work like this.<br />
&ldquo;Not quite at this pace, but it&rsquo;s hard work,&rdquo; says Aurelia prudently.<br />
Maria stays next to us. She has begun to get used to it and is scrubbing vigorously. She tells us she has a bairn in the fourth form and that the lessons are hard, they have a whole heap of subjects. I say that it&rsquo;s better that way, so that they&rsquo;ll get used to hard work from an early age. After that I regret saying it. Who knows how she&rsquo;ll interpret it.<br />
We scrub in silence.<br />
The boss calls me to one side and tells me it&rsquo;s my turn to go and talk to the secret policeman responsible for the factory. He explains which office I have to go to. He tells me not to be frightened. It&rsquo;s nothing serious. Everyone has to go. (&hellip;)<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Apostoae Emilia  ?&rdquo; the secret policeman asks me, leafing through some documents.<br />
I nod yes. He is a man of about forty, going slightly grey, with a placid face and a bored voice. I&rsquo;d expected to see a harsher figure, with a thundering voice.<br />
&ldquo;Maiden name Burac  ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Mother and father agricultural labourers ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Exactly&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What does your husband do ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Locksmith mechanic.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes&hellip; yes&hellip; But why aren&rsquo;t you a member of the Party ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think I have the necessary ideological level, comrade&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I see that you are a good element, you don&rsquo;t have any deviations&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You have received a flat through the factory, how do you feel in it ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Were you put forward to join the Party but refused ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But if you were put forward, would you accept ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; I think so.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And you say you don&rsquo;t have the necessary ideological level ? How is that ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; That&rsquo;s what I think&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What are you lacking in order to have the necessary ideological level ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Perhaps I should study Party documents more&hellip; How do I know ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Are you satisfied with the collective you work in ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And with the foreman ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;With him too.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Do you have any complaints about the workplace ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Nnno.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Do you consider that you lack anything in particular, which the factory might help you with ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; Maybe a gas cylinder&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Is that all ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Well then, fill in a request form, which you will leave with me, and tomorrow go to the union to pick up a voucher for the gas cylinder.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
When I get back, they&rsquo;re on a break. I get out my packed lunch and sit on the bench outside, next to Aurelia.<br />
&ldquo;How was it ?&rdquo; she asks me.<br />
I look at her amazed at how she knew.<br />
&ldquo;The boss told me that I have to go after the break as well.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; it all becomes clear to me. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s alright even so. He asks you what complaints you have. I told him that I&rsquo;d like a gas cylinder and he told me to fill in a request form.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But why hasn&rsquo;t he asked us up to now ?&rdquo;<br />
I nod my head in sign that it&rsquo;s clear why now and not before. We eat. Finally, Aurelia gets out an orange. She tells me about how at her husband&rsquo;s shop they don&rsquo;t stint on unloading the goods. They get all kinds of stuff. Salami, milk, chocolate, everything. And not just them, but in almost all the neighbourhoods. Well, there&rsquo;s still a queue, but only twenty or thirty people, not hordes.<br />
Maria comes over, so we stop talking. Aurelia offers her some of the opened orange. Maria takes a segment, picks off the pith, and then eats it. I look at her with round eyes.<br />
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand the pith. I eat oranges like grapefruit,&rdquo; she smiles.<br />
So as not to show myself up, I don&rsquo;t tell her that I&rsquo;ve not yet had occasion to eat a grapefruit.<br />
<br />
In the afternoon, we all move on to outside. We sweep, clean, dig. We&rsquo;ve received black earth, roses and pieces of lawn from the town hall. We paint all the outside pipes and the mobile crane. On the main wing of the factory, another team, from another section, paints in letters as tall as a man &ldquo;Long Live the Romanian Communist Party&rdquo;. The porters have also received two new colleagues. The asphalting of the road has reached the factory yard.<br />
In the evening, when the power is cut off, they let us go home.<br />
I get back knackered. It&rsquo;s too late to phone Sanda to see how Alice is. I chat with Tzucu for a little. We haven&rsquo;t spoken for two days. He tells me that they were taken off to transplant maize. They go to the Party Farm, uproot the maize from an experimental plot &ndash; large and comely maize, with great big cobs &ndash; and then they plant it at the edge of the fields, two or three rows deep, along the roads which Ceau&#351;escu will travel down to I don&rsquo;t know what agricultural collective. They uproot the puny maize and load it into trailers. Even he doesn&rsquo;t know what happens after that. They carry out all these operations in the blazing sun. At least they give them mineral water.<br />
The third day is a bit lighter. We&rsquo;re busy &ldquo;decking out portraits&rdquo;. We divide into two teams, one for inside and one for outside. I&rsquo;m inside. We make a panel of honour, with photographs of the foremost workers. We&rsquo;re having fun. We put Mitu&rsquo;s photograph as the best of the best, the model to be followed. Then we draw up a graph of political information meetings, with dates and topics that we just make up. That is, not exactly &ndash; we copy them from a template brought by the foreman. We cut out articles from newspapers, which we tack to a piece of polystyrene wrapped in red canvas. We hang up two or three portraits of Ceau&#351;escu. The boss brings us some twenty thick volumes of the works of Uncle Nicu, to put in his office. Because he doesn&rsquo;t have a bookcase, we cart one from the Furniture Factory, on loan. He also brings forty flowerpots, for us to spread around the place, as aesthetically as possible. We have to sign for them. Whatever gets lost or broken, we&rsquo;ll have to pay for.<br />
<br />
There&rsquo;s a hullabaloo outside. Someone&rsquo;s shouting.<br />
Me and Aurelia go to the door to see what it&rsquo;s all about.<br />
A scowling bloke with brown hair, wearing a suit and tie, is rolling his eyes and foaming at the mouth.<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bunch of idiots and dolts ! You&rsquo;re in for it now, I promise you ! As soon as this visit is over you&rsquo;ll have me to answer to ! Is this a factory for drunkards ? Is it wine we make or do we produce for export ? You&rsquo;re irresponsible.&rdquo;<br />
And off he goes like a whirlwind, one of those ones that flatten everything in their path. We find out that it was the grapevines that had upset him. Gaffer Culidiuc is the most affected of all of us. He had planted them, cleaned them and trimmed them for years, and now the lads have already set about pulling them up. He can&rsquo;t watch ; he goes into the workshop. The boss doesn&rsquo;t say anything, because the new workmates are there, but his eyes are blazing. I&rsquo;ll miss shade too, the plump black bunches of grapes&hellip; Gaffer Culidiuc makes a sign to us that the scowling bloke is barmy. We ask him who he is and he says that he is a bigwig in the County branch of the Party.<br />
Not even an hour passes and the blonde&#8209;haired young porter comes in guffawing. He wants to tell us something, but the foreman makes a discreet sign for him to be silent. The porter doesn&rsquo;t catch on and lets rip, thirteen to the dozen. He says that that bloke just now &ndash; Comrade Whirlwind, as I&rsquo;ve christened him in my mind &ndash; found fault with the pine trees by the main gate, and why are they so dusty. They explained to him that they had been washed with the hose, but that they couldn&rsquo;t get them any greener than that. Then the bloke apparently began to bellow that he wasn&rsquo;t interested, that, if need be, they should paint them, only that they should look like real pine trees, from the mountains. And now, perched on the Electrical Plant trucks with mobile ladders, a number of blokes are painting the pine trees with spray guns.<br />
Only Adrian, Maria and gaffer Mitu laugh. Oh, and gaffer Culidiuc, who is in the workshop, standing behind us.<br />
Only now does the hapless porter understand. You can see by his frightened glance.<br />
&ldquo;In the end, it&rsquo;s one way of solving it,&rdquo; he tries to wriggle out of it.<br />
This time, we all laugh.<br />
The porter can&rsquo;t understand a thing.<br />
The boss takes him by the shoulders and asks him to show him where he saw such a thing, because he doesn&rsquo;t believe it. You can see from a mile away that he wants to get him out of the shit.<br />
Today, we leave earlier, so that we&rsquo;ll have time to prepare for the next day and to rest. The boss gives us our final instructions : overalls have to be ironed and starched ; the men have to be shaven and to smell of toothpaste, not of rotgut ; the woman without lipstick, makeup or nail varnish.<br />
I get back home. Tzucu isn&rsquo;t back yet. The pots are empty, and the sink is full. I get down to business. Tzuku turns up. He tells me about how some chap with a loud mouth came and hauled them over the coals : them, for not watering the planted maize, and the blokes from the Party Farm, who were getting ready a herd of thoroughbred cows to send to the agricultural collective that Ceau&#351;escu was going to visit, for sabotaging the event. I described Whirlwind to him and he confirmed it was him. There had been a right carry&#8209;on with the cows. In the first place, he made them remove all the black cows from the stock, because they didn&rsquo;t set an optimistic tone. Then he was dissatisfied with the way they had been washed and curried. But the worst was when he battened onto their hooves, for not being glossy enough, because he knew that thoroughbred cows have to have shiny hooves. In the end, he made them lacquer the hooves, for them to look like in the textbook.<br />
We go on chatting about this and that and then fall asleep.<br />
The big day.<br />
The director general and the boss make the inspection. They closely examine each of us individually, straightening a collar or two. With all this protective gear on us we look like something out of an exhibition. The atmosphere is tense. Our new colleagues haven&rsquo;t turned up, probably because the official delegation has gone somewhere else. Comrade Suit goes out and we are left to ourselves. The time passes slowly. We walk to and fro, listlessly. We don&rsquo;t even feel like sitting down, so as not to crease anything.<br />
On the street, on either side, workers, pioneers and communist youth have already been deployed, with placards and flags. Their chatter can be heard as far as in the factory yard.<br />
From time to time, gaffer Mitu walks around swaying, with arms outstretched, as he imagines a cosmonaut walks. We smile, but we don&rsquo;t feel like laughing. Whatever you might say, we are excited. It&rsquo;s not every day that Ceau&#351;escu comes to our workshop. And I think that we are a little afraid too, even if no one says so. We have to make a good impression ! A very good impression !<br />
From time to time, the foreman brings us news from Comrade Suit : Ceau&#351;escu is in town ; Ceau&#351;escu is in the viewing stand, the parade is about to begin ; Ceau&#351;escu is having lunch ; Ceau&#351;escu is heading for the agricultural collective. The tension grows. The worst thing is that we don&rsquo;t have anything to do ; we just have to wait. We have to be ready at any moment.<br />
At around five in the afternoon, a stupendous piece of news arrives : Ceau&#351;escu has left town.<br />
But we remain in position, in case it&rsquo;s a false alarm.<br />
At around seven, Comrade Suit appears and confirms that Ceau&#351;escu has left town. He thanks us and tells us that maybe we will be luckier next time. He leaves in a hurry.<br />
We&rsquo;re left to ourselves and the atmosphere suddenly relaxes.<br />
&ldquo;Boss, what about those new colleagues of ours who didn&rsquo;t turn up today ? What shall we do ? Clock them out ?&rdquo; asks gaffer Mitu drolly.<br />
&ldquo;Bugger them !&rdquo;<br />
We all decide to go to a restaurant and celebrate our achievement.</p>

4 Hens Heaven Raiul gainilor Novel "Ego-prose" series, Polirom, 2006, 187 pages represented by Residenz (Austria) Jacqueline Chambon, Actes Sud (France), Drutvo Apokalipsa (Slovenia), Residenz (Austria, world wide rights), Manni Editori (Italy), Czarne (Poland), Icaria (Spain), Paradox (Bulgaria) <p>All the occurrences in the novel take place in a street at the outskirts of a Romanian provincial town. The majority of the street&rsquo;s inhabitants are working class. Once the &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; of the former political regime, they are now the &ldquo;ballast&rdquo; of the new order. Now, they are pensioners or unemployed &ndash; the pensioners of a bankrupt socio&#8209;economic and political system, in fact. Cast by history to the margins of the world, their main pass&#8209;times become drinking and chatting. As the characters become absorbed in conversation, reality imperceptibly dematerialises and we enter a construct of group mentality, tributary to the totalitarian epoch. The world no longer consists of objects, but of distorted recollections, nostalgia, phantasms, frustration, clich&eacute;s, stereotypes, projects, and eccentric fantasies. The poles of this world, constructed as a place of collective refuge by the inhabitants of the street, are the ghost of Ceau&#351;escu, who is master of the past, and the West, which represents a strange and uncertain world. One episode of an exuberant humour is that in which one of the characters meets Ceau&#351;escu in person : the discussion and events that occur during this visit are as hilarious as they are spectacular. This is a novel written with verve and elegance, a novel that is both current and bursting with humour. The reader is left with no respite in which to become bored, for events come in waves, while the colourful dialogue only serves to heighten the atmosphere. This is a book that provokes much laughter, but beyond the laughter, there looms great disquietude.</p> <p>I got off the train giddy from all the jolting and went straight to the Central Committee. So I knock on the door&hellip; and I&rsquo;ve barely finished knocking when this huge monster of an officer comes out, with his cap pushed back, he must have been hot, poor blighter, and he lays into me :</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oi, what do you want, Moldavian ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say how he knew I was Moldavian, since I hadn&rsquo;t so much as uttered a single word, but I&rsquo;d got off on the wrong foot. That made my blood freeze even more than the scar on his cheek, which was enough to give you a fright in itself &ndash; the lumbering hulk didn&rsquo;t even need a pistol. At first, I thought he must be one of those folk that read your mind, because he&rsquo;d kenned me from the very start. But then I realised that, even if he could read minds, he still couldn&rsquo;t have known I was Moldavian, because I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about me being Moldavian at the time and thoughts, in general, don&rsquo;t have a Moldavian accent. <br />
&ldquo;I should like to speak to comrade Nicolae Ceau&#351;escu, Secretary General of the Romanian Communist Party, President of the Socialist Republic of Romania,&rdquo; says I briskly and stiffly, like on the first page of those school textbooks, because I was defecating myself with fear, if I can put it like that. <br />
&ldquo;Really, now, Moldavian ? I think you got the first prize at school, didn&rsquo;t you ? Out with it !&rdquo; <br />
&ldquo;Really, sir ! I didn&rsquo;t get the first prize at school, sir !&rdquo; I reply, like in the army, short and quick, intimidated by the uniform. <br />
&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you heard of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces ? Get down !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes I&rsquo;ve heard, sir !&rdquo; I shout up in the air, because I&rsquo;d thrown myself to the ground on the order to get down. I&rsquo;m telling you, mate, he laid into me with the army drill just like in the Party rulebook, so hard that he knocked all the baccy I&rsquo;d smoked in the train out of me. That must have been the signal. After he&rsquo;d worked me up into a sweat, he pulled up a chair and invited me to sit down, he gave me a glass of tap water, a decent bloke in his way, and opened himself a can of beer. I thought it was a grenade at first &ndash; I&rsquo;d never seen anything like it in my life.<br />
&ldquo;And just what business have you got with uncle Nicu ?&rdquo; he says trying to lure me. I says nowt. I&rsquo;m not daft, am I ? Well, if I&rsquo;d answered it would have been as if I was in agreement with calling him &ldquo;uncle Nicu&rdquo;, and if I was in agreement, it would have been like I&rsquo;d said it myself ; and that&rsquo;s just what he was waiting for.<br />
&ldquo;Alright, I see you don&rsquo;t want to say, it must be secret,&rdquo; says he slyly. <br />
&ldquo;Wait here, I&rsquo;ll go and see if he&rsquo;s home.&rdquo; <br />
He takes two steps, turns round and asks me : &ldquo;Who should I say is asking after him ?&rdquo; I froze to the spot ! Who was I after all ? What the hell should I tell him ? <br />
&ldquo;A man of labour !&rdquo; says I proudly, but dead with fright. &ldquo;A lathe operator,&rdquo; I added ; I thought it sounded more impressive, like a kind of function. <br />
&ldquo;Damned Moldavian lathe operator you&rdquo;, grumbled the huge monster impressively. I think he regretted having laid into me with the drill. He went into his booth and whispered with some one on the telephone. <br />
When he comes out, he says to me : &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck, they&rsquo;re just getting ready to go off to Zimbabwe, but he&rsquo;ll receive you, he can&rsquo;t refuse a lathe operator. Follow me.<br />
&rdquo; He pulls a rag out of his pocket and blindfolds me. And I&rsquo;m telling you, mate, he takes me right and left I don&rsquo;t know how many times, so that if he&rsquo;d left me there on my own after that I&rsquo;d have starved to death before I found the exit. When he takes off the blindfold, we&rsquo;re in an office full of doctors in white coats, with stethoscopes around their necks, drinking coffee. They put their coffee down, and one of them makes me stick out my tongue, another takes a blood sample, another pokes one of those pocket torches in my eyes, another one listens to me through his stethoscope, and another, begging your pardon, searches up my bottom. Under the white coats, you could glimpse their epaulettes and medals, I think they must have been really big generals. I&rsquo;ve never gone through a medical examination like that since then and I don&rsquo;t think I ever will until the day of my autopsy. He blindfolds me with the rag again and makes me dizzy leading me down all them corridors ; everywhere there was a smell of coffee and schnitzels. After we&rsquo;d gone up in two different lifts, he takes off the blindfold and says to me : &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the door, you go in by yourself, he doesn&rsquo;t like to know he&rsquo;s being guarded. Say that you&rsquo;ve come in off the street and mind what you do after that. Ask after Lena, otherwise he&rsquo;ll get cross. Ah, I was about to forget, tell him that he&rsquo;s the most beloved son of the people, he likes that best of all.&rdquo; And then that huge monster gave a smile enough to give me the shivers, with that scar on his face that made him look like he was laughing with two gobs. One of the lads though, in his own way. I knock on the door, but I&rsquo;ve barely finished knocking when I hear : &ldquo;Enter !&rdquo; I take my cap in my hands, as the saying goes, because I didn&rsquo;t have a cap, I grip the door handle and turn it. My heart was beating like a titmouse&rsquo;s. He was sitting at his desk casting a die : &ldquo;If it comes up three, I&rsquo;ll go to Zimbabwe, if not, I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m ill. Six ! That&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m ill ! If it comes up three, then I&rsquo;m ill with high blood pressure, if not, then I&rsquo;ve got a catarrh. Three ! I guessed it, I&rsquo;m ill with high blood pressure !&rdquo; There wasn&rsquo;t so much as peep out of me &ndash; well, so as not to bother him at his work. &ldquo;What do you say, Moldavian, what&rsquo;ll come up ?&rdquo; he takes me by surprise. Me, I&rsquo;m dumbstruck ! &ldquo;Hurry up, I haven&rsquo;t got shitloads of time !&rdquo; &ldquo;Four ! Comrade Secretary General of the Romanian Communist Party, President of the Socialist Republic of Romania, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and most beloved son of the people,&rdquo; I blurt out. His face flushed like a rose. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see now ! Four ! You Moldavian bugger &ndash; you&rsquo;ve got some luck ! You get a Dacia on me.&rdquo; My tongue was itching to ask him what would have happened if I hadn&rsquo;t guessed, but I didn&rsquo;t dare. &ldquo;But not a new Dacia, one that&rsquo;s a year old. Bobu lost it at cards.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you, Comrade Secretary General of the Romanian Communist Party, President of the Socialist Republic of Romania, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and most beloved son of the people !&rdquo; &ldquo;Leave out the fancy stuff, as long as it&rsquo;s between ourselves you can call me Nicu, like everybody else.&rdquo; Me, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. One of the lads, I&rsquo;m telling you, pity they shot him like a dog. Lena was horrid though. I was standing there and thinking to myself whether I should tell him about our Litza or not, because if I had a Dacia now that problem with being late would be cleared up, when in comes this lady all dressed up in traditional costume, carrying a tray of bread and salt &ndash; and she was such a looker that your eyes would have popped out on their stalks. But that philanderer doesn&rsquo;t let me feast my eyes not even a wee bit, he chases her out quickly : &ldquo;Come on, get lost, can&rsquo;t you see we&rsquo;ve got work to do ?&rdquo; As jealous as could be, you could see it on his face. &ldquo;Excuse me, I thought that it was the delegation from China !&rdquo; chirps the bonny lass melodiously, like that folk singer Irina Loghin. &ldquo;The&#8209;the&#8209;they&rsquo;re next door.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d got annoyed and was stuttering. &ldquo;Hmm, let us return to the order of the day, comrade, what urgency brings you to me ?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m a man of labour&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve come in off the street to see how I am.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, eggzactly, and to see how Comrade Elena is, your life&rsquo;s partner, the internationally renowned scientist and loving mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not so well, she&rsquo;s just sent word that she has a catarrh&hellip; and as for me I&rsquo;m suffering from high blood pressure, but what can you do, duty is duty, the cause of the people never takes sick leave.&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about right. You can say that again.&rdquo; &ldquo;What, are you deaf ?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, but that&rsquo;s what they say where I come from.&rdquo; &ldquo;Aha !&rdquo; I looked at him, sitting in his armchair like a schoolmaster and picking at the dots on the die with his fingernail. &ldquo;What the hell, this black peels off ! I&rsquo;d no idea.&rdquo; I kept a respectful silence and let him get on with his business. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why that dodger Postelnicu always wins !&rdquo; The room was large, with a colour telly from the period and Pa&#351;cani curtains. &ldquo;But tell me, Moldavian, I&rsquo;ve heard that people are grumbling. Have you got milk for the children ?&rdquo; I was up to my neck now ! How the hell could I tell him that you had to get up at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning for a bottle of milk ? That you had to queue up for so long that you used to start growing mould ? &ldquo;I regretfully have to announce that I don&rsquo;t have any children, comrade General Secretary of the Commun&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Whoa there ! That&rsquo;s no good, Moldavian, not to have any children. What kind of lathe operator are you if you don&rsquo;t have any children ? Aren&rsquo;t you even a little bit ashamed ? Didn&rsquo;t I say at I don&rsquo;t what plenary meeting that you all have to make children, so that at least then you&rsquo;d be doing something ?&rdquo; &ldquo;Forgive me, comrade Secretary General&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Go home and make children, otherwise I&rsquo;ll take the Dacia back. As easily as I gave it to you, just as easily I&rsquo;ll take it back. You don&rsquo;t mess with me,&rdquo; says he. I bowed my head like a naughty schoolboy. What the hell could I say ? &ldquo;Or maybe you&rsquo;ve got a problem with your little piston ?&rdquo; At first, I didn&rsquo;t even know what he was talking about, but I got the gist quickly enough. &ldquo;No, comrade Secretary General&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Look, if you have any problems with your little piston, just you tell me ! I&rsquo;ll take you to a doctor, he&rsquo;s a Thai, he boils all kinds of weeds from over there and makes you drink this potion, it has a horrible taste, a bit like whiskey, but after that you&rsquo;ll swear that you&rsquo;re a jackhammer, nothing short ! You&rsquo;ll break concrete !&rdquo; &ldquo;No, not me&hellip; Comrade Secretary General&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Look, don&rsquo;t be ashamed ! You come, you tell me, and it&rsquo;ll get sorted. What the hell ! You&rsquo;ve got to put your back into the demographic problem.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what he said, I swear. I liked the Bullet&#8209;Riddled&#8209;One for that bit, a real committee lad. Lena was horrid though, I&rsquo;m telling you. She didn&rsquo;t even come into the room the whole time I was there, and he had guests as well, didn&rsquo;t he ? But as for the demographic question, that really was no joke. You should have seen how it got his hackles up&hellip;<br />
But let me get back to my visit. He picks at the die a bit more and then he looks to the left, he looks to the right, and he fetches from the cupboard some wine and soda and a box of cigars, I thought it was a box of chocolates at first. But you could see from his face that he was scared in case Lena caught him with the booze and gave him a tongue&#8209;lashing. I can&rsquo;t complain though, it was a good wine ; the old codger had taste. &ldquo;Take a cigar,&rdquo; he urges me, &ldquo;Fidel Castro sent them to me for the 23 August workers&rsquo; holiday.&rdquo; If only my wife could have seen me, you&rsquo;d have thought I was Kojak, she really used to like that serial. &ldquo;Here, Moldavian, have you heard of a certain Goma ?&rdquo; asks The&#8209;One&#8209;They&#8209;Shot. Me, so as not to look really stupid, I says : &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the name, comrade Secretary&hellip;&rdquo; I was thinking that he must be some Party bigwig or something. &ldquo;Well then, tell me, tell me everything. Where did you hear about him ?&rdquo; What could I say ? I couldn&rsquo;t get the words out. I didn&rsquo;t have a clue who he was and I still don&rsquo;t know, but I remembered the name, because it wasn&rsquo;t a common one. &ldquo;There was this bloke at our lathe shop&hellip;&rdquo; I ventured. &ldquo;No, man, this one I&rsquo;m asking you about is a rotter.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, the one at our place isn&rsquo;t much better,&rdquo; says I, playing along with him. &ldquo;But have you heard of Iliescu ?&rdquo; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t heard of him, comrade secretary General&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Better for you ! That one, he&rsquo;s another rotter, but more dangerous than the other one.&rdquo; Look, I swear, that&rsquo;s what he really said. Because during the revolution, when I saw him on the telly, I remembered this discussion eggzactly. &ldquo;Look here, listen to me, if I die and you fall into the hands of that gypsy Iliescu, your happiness is at an end !&rdquo; &ldquo;How could you die, comrade Secretary General&hellip; How could it be possible ?&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible, Moldavian, because for me everything is possible !&rdquo; &ldquo;A&#8209;ha,&rdquo; says I, like an idiot. &ldquo;That one, he&rsquo;ll flay your hides, like the KGB. You&rsquo;ll live to mourn my name !&rdquo; I&rsquo;m telling you, mate, I can almost hear him now. He could smell something was up. &ldquo;If he takes after that Gorbachev and bungs you in period of transition, like he keeps pestering me, not even the Americans will get you out of it. He keeps going on at him about the tunnel of transition, with the light at the end of it, that he&rsquo;s waiting for us Romanians. Ballocks ! If we enter the tunnel, they&rsquo;ll pull us out in pieces, like spare parts. Mark my words !&rdquo; Look, everything the Unjustly&#8209;Bullet&#8209;Riddled one told me, it all came true ; it was as if he was reading it from somewhere. After the Revolution, I heard eggzactly his words from Iliescu and from the others, it was as if they&rsquo;d been eavesdropping as we were talking. After a while the Bullet&#8209;Riddled&shy;&#8209;One looks at his watch and says : &ldquo;I ought to get a move on. I&rsquo;m late for the card game.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sorry to have bothered you, comrade Secretary&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Hang on, where are you off to, all empty&#8209;handed ?&rdquo; He rummages under the desk and pulls out two parcels, all nicely wrapped up with ribbon. &ldquo;Look here, this one&rsquo;s for the girl, for Alina, she&rsquo;s got a pair of Guban sandals and two bananas, and this one&rsquo;s for Marius, he&rsquo;s got two tennis rackets and a Chinese chocolate bar.&rdquo; I froze to the spot. He knew everything, mate ! It was just what me bairns wanted. And here&rsquo;s me, telling him that I didn&rsquo;t have any bairns&hellip; Now there was a real Committee lad for you !</p>

7 The Baiut Alley Lads Baiuteii Novel "Ego Prose" series, Polirom, 2006, 264 pages Polirom Czarne (Poland), Acantilado (Spain), Panorama + (Bulgaria), University of Plymouth Press (United Kingdom) <p>This book by brothers Filip and Matei Florian is original first of all for its technique : each narrator recounts an event from his childhood through his own eyes, while the other rounds off the story, gives it new meanings, and offers revelations to his co&#8209;narrator and brother. Thus, &lsquo;delicate matters&rsquo; that had remained unelucidated in the past are cleared up in the present, confessions are made, and truths unuttered at the time are now spoken. The dialogue between the two narrators provides delights for the reader, as the pair&rsquo;s childhood grows from memory beneath our very eyes, with a candour and force that transports us to a miraculous world, interpreted and evaluated by the mature eyes of those who now reinvent it.<br />
However, beyond this aspect, there is a freedom from constraint, created by the child&rsquo;s viewpoint, whereby serious, personal subjects are dealt with, such as their parents&rsquo; divorce or the death of their grandparents, but above all general aspects of life in a totalitarian society. The aberrations of the ideology and way of life imposed by communism are refracted through the prism of childish naivety, which accentuates their absurdity and grotesqueness. What remains in spite of such aspects is a serene book, whose finale, to which every page builds up, is, in fact, brotherly love, a love &lsquo;narrated&rsquo; through the personal miracles of each brother, miracles that are now dissected, brought down from the magic of childhood into a realism which naturally still preserves a question mark, a fairytale thread.<br />
The authors familiarise us with the various characters that descend from the world of fairytale into Baiut Alley in Bucharest, where the two brothers live : for example, Sting and Stung, Matei&rsquo;s friends, who suddenly turn up in a jar of mustard, and whom Filip now regrets, at the time the story is told, because he never saw them. Or we delight in characters who cross over from the cinema, television and children&rsquo;s magazines, becoming &lsquo;Joe Lemonade&rsquo;, &lsquo;Giani Morandi&rsquo;, &lsquo;Rome Specs&rsquo; or &lsquo;Brooslee&rsquo;, names reinvented for the stars of the day, filtered through the childish imagination and brought back to life for the amusement of the reader in the pages of the book.<br />
Their shared love of football, moreover for the same team, Bucharest&rsquo;s Dynamo, creates other episodes, develops another world, one of sighs and incomprehensible passions, which draws the two brothers closer, creating for them a shared frontline. This love unfolds at a level that comes close to poetry : football and its related passions are narrated with candour, so that we discover a story beyond the stands, another tale of the miraculous which we all too often pass by without discovering.<br />
In the end, <em>The Baiut Alley Lads</em> is a novel about the miracles in our own back yard, regardless of whether they occur in an obscure lane in an obscure district of a land kept in obscurity by communist dictatorship. However, even if they are viewed only through the lens of naivety and now transformed into an exceptional tale, for miracles there are no impediments, no barriers. And those who attempt to raise barriers to the miraculous are, ultimately, doomed to disappear. What remains is a simple tale, but one that is astonishing in its power to absorb us even now.</p> <p><strong>The incredible adventures of Sting and Stung</strong><br />
<br />
Sting and Stung came into being in a jar of mustard, the very next morning after I dreamt of serpentine roads and devils. Had it been necessary to invent a realm from whence they might come forth &ndash; a couple of translucent, earnest&#8209;looking blobs, faceless and ageless, and generally possessing no other quality save their existence &ndash; then that jar, of the kind Mum used to wash thoroughly as soon as the mustard had finished, for subsequent use as glasses, and thick, ugly, heavy&#8209;duty glasses at that, then the jar upon which I was fixing eyes still dazed by sleep and dreams would have been by far the most appropriate.<br />
There is one thing I have learned (although no book was required for that end, just a tiny amount of attention), namely when miracles occur, even small&#8209;sized miracles like this one, it is never enough to focus on just one aspect. So as to prove to you that I&rsquo;m not being funny, or trying to pull your leg, or having you on, or anything like that, having been carried away with the thrill to which almost all grown&#8209;ups succumb the moment they put pen to paper, I assure you I am fully aware of how unlikely it is for two characters to come into being &ndash; hey, presto ! &ndash; in a jar of mustard. Granted, it would be far more convenient were things to happen that way, yet I would somehow feel uneasy about it because 1. It&rsquo;d mean throwing truth down the drain and 2. I&rsquo;d no longer be able to look you in the eye (to say nothing of Filip, who&rsquo;d never want to hear from me again, and that&rsquo;s a fact). For his sake then, if not for your own, and ultimately for my own sake, I&rsquo;ll do my best to clarify, as tactfully as narrated miracles demand, the genesis of Sting and Stung in a jar of mustard, one dull Sunday morning in October, most probably at eight o&rsquo;clock.<br />
To sum up, Sting and Stung came into being one dull morning, following the night I had that dream about serpentine roads and devils, a dream that has continued to pursue me (with almost wizard&#8209;like persistence) to the present day. (...)<br />
All I know is that I woke up in a dazed state (as I&rsquo;ve already told you), with flickering strip lights and coiled devils weighing heavily on my mind, grabbed a picture book without too much text &ndash; Snow White &ndash; and made my way into the kitchen. Mum was toasting bread on the gas stove, and the resulting fragrance together with the burning light bulb (it was a dark, overcast day) made the kitchen, how shall I put it, seem like the first and the last place on earth, the only place whose existence was beyond all doubt, as though in the beginning God had not created light, the waters and the dry land, but that kitchen of ours with Mum toasting bread in it, prior to summoning me out of sleep, story book in hand. I don&rsquo;t know what that book had to do with it all, I didn&rsquo;t so much as glance at it, I knew it by heart, yet, I feel bound to say it once more, when you&rsquo;re dealing with miracles even minor details are there for a purpose. Filip was not there, it may not even have been Sunday, but as far as the jar of mustard (into which my eyes bored with no hint of alarm), the morning and the fragrance of toast are concerned, you should not for a moment doubt them. I could of course claim that I was hearing, filtered to a high pitch through the window pane, the clip&#8209;clop of horses drawing a cart over the asphalt, and the garbled street cry of the gypsies asking for empty bottles to buy : emmee booo&rsquo;les, hooo ! Yet something tells me I&rsquo;d be superimposing images, and superimposed images are the last thing I need right now.<br />
I had no particular expectation that morning, the dream had slowed down to a distant throb, I was sitting on my chair at the table, staring into the void, until the void into which I was staring sucked me in with a thoroughness that enabled me to realise that what I was actually staring at was the mustard in a jar.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;ve ever had the curiosity to pay any attention to what goes on in a jar of that description, but I assure you that, at first, you won&rsquo;t notice anything much, except a mass of something which could only be described as yellow. If the mustard jar has already been opened, the view is much better, of course : the mustard spoon has carved into the mass a network of tunnels, paths, and highways. At this point it is quite easy to lose yourself in their maze, stained yellow and damp though they might seem to you. And since a miracle (unfortunately or fortunately) can almost always also be explained logically, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be a major challenge for anyone to come up with the following question : &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use of all those tunnels and crossroads and lanes if no one lives in there ?&rdquo; I do believe that is what I must have asked myself. And just like that, in a most natural sequence of events leading from the answer to a logical question to a miracle with the fragrance of toast, without Mum, whose back was turned on the whole thing, not even remotely suspecting what was going on in the kitchen of flat 40, Sting and Stung, the two inseparable friends who were to become the trustworthy companions of my childhood, came into existence. I did not whoop with excitement, nor did I whoop with terror, the light bulb did not flicker like the strip light in our bathroom, the window did not burst open from some unaccountable gust of wind, and the dogs in the street did not let out so much as a whimper when from down there, from deep inside the jar of mustard, the following conversation echoed for the first time in the Barracks Road district of Bucharest and, quite possibly, the whole of the universe (how am I to know ?) :<br />
&ldquo;How&rsquo;re you doin&rsquo;, Sting ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; fine, Stung.&ldquo;<br />
&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s Missus Sting doing ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; fine, too. And what about Missus Stung ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing fine. Bye, Sting.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Bye, Stung.&rdquo;<br />
I&rsquo;m telling you the truth, I listened to them talk without batting an eyelid. That was another thing I&rsquo;d just learned : miracles are easy to get used to. At that particular age, at least.<br />
It is elder brothers who are always the problem. It is not as if they had anything against our miracles, frowning upon them, or anything like that. Not at all. It is simply that they find miracles somewhat hard to comprehend. And if a brother happens to be eleven years your senior, now that is definitely a case when you have to take a break and fill him in nice an&rsquo; easy, so that on future occasions you will be sure to avoid any surprises. But be that as it may, I&rsquo;ve got to take some time off at all costs. Make a detour. Digress, divagate, stray from the subject. Open that thing we commonly call a parenthesis. Or whatever. Here are some points (seven in number) :<br />
&bull; Little brothers have their own distinct and not&#8209;to&#8209;be&#8209;tampered&shy;&#8209;with reality <br />
&bull; Notwithstanding the undeniable credit that goes to them for having watched Mum&rsquo;s belly getting bigger and bigger (with you inside), having pushed you around in a pram, having listened to your priest&#8209;like gurgles and the like (the list could go on for many pages), elder brothers have no right whatsoever so much as to hint that your memories (however vague they might be) are, in actual fact, erroneous<br />
&bull; When that kind of thing does occur, nonetheless, it ought to be properly acknowledged as such, so as to remove the slightest shade of suspicion. Consequently, such ambiguities as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t really remember&rdquo; should no longer occur on the same page with statements of such obvious certainty as &ldquo;he&rsquo;s been laying it on thick, way too thick&rdquo;<br />
&bull; Objections, reservations and misgivings would be much easier to accept if we, the little ones, were granted, even for just one moment, the right to decide what&rsquo;s true or false regarding certain episodes in the child&#8209;life of the big ones (for instance : Filip + Alexandra Stefanescu ; Filip + Comrade Ularescu).<br />
In conclusion :<br />
&bull; Little brothers are envious of elder brothers<br />
&bull; Little brothers and elder brothers can never be equal<br />
&bull; It all comes down to Sting and Stung.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of the miracles gracing the biography of elder brothers<br />
<br />
The trouble is I have never seen Sting and Stung for myself, be it because I wear glasses, or be it for different reasons altogether. Now I did used to hear Matei talking as he moved around the flat but, why should I lie to you, I thought he was talking to himself. (&hellip;) As for the theory Matei advances in the previous chapter (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s elder brothers that are always the problem&rdquo;), I happen to believe the exact opposite. And in order to prove that it is younger brothers who are always the problem, I&rsquo;m going to give you my own list of points (also seven in number) :<br />
&bull; For a while, younger brothers firmly believe there is only one reality, and it is only brothers that fall under two different headings &ndash; younger and older<br />
&bull; Younger brothers would not even for a moment suspect that, in the distant past, older brothers did all sorts of things in close communion with their own angels and elves<br />
&bull; Timepieces tick independently of both brothers&rsquo; will<br />
&bull; Each age has its own miracles, each miracle its own witness, each witness a brother (or was on the point of having one).<br />
Consequently :<br />
&bull; Brothers can write a book together, but can never come across the same angels and elves simultaneously<br />
&bull; Even when they grow up, younger brothers remain younger than older brothers ;<br />
&bull; Younger brothers never forget having their butts kicked by older brothers.<br />
What am I to do, then, I, Filip, concealed so far behind the mask of older&#8209;brother ? The only thing left for me to do me is reminisce nostalgically about how I used to kick the butts of younger brothers, immerse myself in my own miracles and serenely swim among them.<br />

Miracle A : Summers are so hot in Severin, so muggy, that you try to stay in the shade wherever you can find it. We found it behind some bushes in the graveyard, spread our mat on a very big stone (on which someone had carved some letters and numbers), laid out our things around the house, and started cooking a meal in a rusty tin (which someone had used for lighting some candles). I fetched four earthworms, snapped them into small segments and allowed them to simmer in our stew, the girls chopped rose petals, anemone buttons, iris leaves, mixed in some gravel and dirt, stirred well so that the stew wouldn&rsquo;t stick to the bottom of the pot, and when everything was ready, we put the food onto plates (torn out of newspaper pages so as to approximate round shapes). Next, since we were playing mums and dads anyway, we had to undress and lounge naked about the house, watch telly, hang our clothes on the peg, a wooden cross (on which someone had carved some letters and numbers), but still something was missing, as the mum and the baby had no willies, so we looked around for two twiggies, adjusted them properly, so that Cerasela and Lori would also have their willies like all human beings.<br />
<br />
Miracle B : The beige Soviet Pobeda car would drive off its patch of packed earth in a cloud of dust, would charge through puddles splashing right and left like a speedboat, would drive off through the snow leaving deep ruts in its wake, yet it would always grind its way back to the same spot, so that I could see it from our windows, parked sideways outside our block. And there was also Fane from the sixth grade who, as a rule, would hit me repeatedly across the back of the head saying my noggin looked like a watermelon, and who, after each football game, league or international, would chase me till he caught me, twist my arms behind my back and unleash a rain of finger&#8209;flicks at my lugs (and such jug lugs, too !) until it hurt so much that I started crying. And then one Wednesday, when the championship was off and no one in Severin remembered the cup because Rapid had beaten ªtiinþa in the end game and they say you shouldn&rsquo;t trouble the dead for forty days after their demise, Fane lent me his catapult. And he said I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hit the Pobeda. Now the Pobeda was no longer parked sideways, for I wasn&rsquo;t upstairs, in either the large or the small room, but down on the packed earth, where I could have a front view of the Pobeda. And you can bet your bottom dollar I hit the target, hit it spot on, I did, first shot I took, I shattered its windshield to smithereens, showering the bonnet with tiny bluish glass shards (like fish scales), and Fane chased me till he caught me, twisted my arms behind my back till the owner came followed by his wife (the nurse who&rsquo;d once given me shots when I had a bad cold), they were screaming their heads off, red in the face like boiled lobsters, he was wearing his pyjamas, she was wearing a housecoat, then everyone came and Fane told them I was a Dynamo supporter. Some time later Dad came (he was a Steagu supporter), then he left, not straight away, but in two days or so, went into Bucharest to buy a Pobeda windshield with the holiday money he had set aside for our trip to Sarmizegetusa.<br />
<br />
Miracle C : Harun&#8209;al&#8209;Rashid had been at war for some time. He loved his country and wanted to defend it. But he also loved his wife, and so, although he had the eunuchs guard her against evil men, Harun&#8209;al&#8209;Rashid, without letting her know, had also arranged for his faithful djinns to guard her, just in case. And guess what happened. The eunuchs he&rsquo;d hired were not really eunuchs, they were just pretending to be eunuchs, but in actual fact they could do all sorts of things, and as the woman was pining for what Harun&#8209;al&#8209;Rashid used to do to her in times of peace, she came to an agreement with the eunuchs that they should be doing those things to her, or, well, that they should just do them to each other. It was lucky the djinns were there. They got terribly angry about what was going on in the bedchambers, and squeezed under the palace (where the foundations were, I suppose) and started shaking it with all their might, hard, really hard, so as to punish Harun&#8209;al&#8209;Rashid&rsquo;s wife and the eunuchs who&rsquo;d lied about being eunuchs. And at that very moment, as I was reading how the palace was shaking and how cross the djinns were, everything started shaking for real, although the block in the Baiut Alley was not exactly a palace. The walls and the furniture were making cracking noises, the lamp was swinging as though I had climbed up onto a chair and given it a shove with my hand, toys, notebooks, books and pencils were galumphing on the shelves, on the brackets and on the table, my reading lamp was hopping up and down at my bedside, and even I, no matter how hard I was trying to keep to one place, was sliding towards the edge of my bed, but what I found worst was the noise, the windows rattling in their casements, the doors threshing on their hinges, a series of thuds culminating with an explosive one, a racket coming from somewhere else, the objects that, having had enough of galumphing, had now started falling onto the floor, the djinns were truly going berserk, no matter how faithful they were to Harun&#8209;al&#8209;Rashid, they were behaving too much like the evil spirits of Crihala and had now stampeded into Barracks Road, I could not for the life of me figure out what I&rsquo;d done wrong, I was a nine&#8209;year old child after all (and quite harmless compared to the eunuchs), and I threw my blanket to one side and jumped to my feet and in the hall I ran into Dad who was reeling towards me, shaken out of his sleep, in his underwear, not wearing his glasses, then Mum was there too, coming out of the bathroom, all wet, with nothing but a towel wrapped around her body. I was trying to tell them about the djinns (to make them understand), I was stammering, shaking, unable to get the right words out, the three of us were rolling as if on board a ship in a storm, Mum was hugging me in her arms, caressing my hair, she suddenly understood what I meant by those djinns and told me it was an earthquake. There was an earthquake going on, you know, a big, big earthquake, and on being given that particular piece of information, I no longer worried. Dad was fully awake now, he dragged us into the door frame (Dad was an expert on what to do in the event of an earthquake), he was steadying us with his arms, and we just stood there clinging to one another for a long, long time until the objects around calmed down, the cracking noises, the galumphing, the rattling, the threshing and the thuds came to an end, the lights went off, only the moonlight stayed on (a large reddish moon), and now people started galumphing, spilling out of their blocks like ants out of their anthills, screaming and running, I guess no one had told them it had been an earthquake and not the revenge of the djinns that had hit Barracks Road. Later on we discerned by candlelight what had caused the explosive thud following the series of lesser thuds, it was the telly, whose screen had shattered like a Pobeda wind&shy;shield hit by a catapult. Before I fell asleep, Mom told me a story about a white&#8209;dotted mushroom out of which a mass of dwarves were spilling out, running among the tiny flowers and grass blades in the meadow, and screaming happily, just like the people outside.<br />
<br />
Miracle D : the Spanish teacher was sitting with her legs crossed, the Spanish teacher&rsquo;s skirt had slid back, I was standing next to the teacher&rsquo;s desk, watching the Spanish teacher correcting my essay in red ink, the Spanish teacher&rsquo;s left thigh was bare, the day was sunny, the Spanish teacher&rsquo;s high&#8209;heeled shoe was quivering slightly, on my essay written in blue ink all sorts of red signs were throbbing, the Spanish teacher&rsquo;s left thigh coloured brown whenever a passing cloud obscured the sun, I wished I had written a long, long essay, with plenty of mistakes, because the Spanish teacher&rsquo;s left thigh had dozed off, it had dozed off for sure, one could tell by the way it was breathing, and it would have been such a pity to wake it up.</p>

8 A Hundred Years at the Gates of the Orient O suta de ani la portile Orientului Novel "Ego Prose" serie, Polirom, 2007, 201 pages Polirom All rights available <p>Written in searialised form, with short and lively scenes, Ioan Gro&#351;an&rsquo;s novel is an extraordinary &ldquo;historical&rdquo; tale, in which, however, modern inserts make an important contribution to the flavour of the narrative and to the extraordinary humour to be found throughout the book. The action proper extends over the 17th Century, and the characters and fictive events are described using archaic language. However, besides the contribution it makes to the book&rsquo;s atmosphere, this archaic idiom is &lsquo;exploded&rsquo; by a series of literary references, allusions to Romanian and international literature, and the presence of neologisms that cause the reader to laugh out loud.<br />
The story centres on a handful of characters : on the one hand, there is the Voievode Barzovius, accompanied by Eagle the Spatharius and the rhapsode Broante&#351;, who is on his way to Istanbul to try and regain the throne he has lost in Moldavia. On the other hand, we have the &ldquo;reverend&rdquo; monks Methodius and Jovanutz, whose secret mission is to reach Rome and beg the Pope for an alliance with Moldavia, with the aim of annihilating the Ottoman armies. On the way, a whole host of other characters appear, all of them with their own zany stories, who create episodes that heighten the atmosphere and enhance the novelty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Anachronistically, the Voievode Barzovius and his companions arrive at the sultan&rsquo;s court, where they are greeted by the &ldquo;odalisque on duty&rdquo;. Moreover, we find the sultan in his own fitness salon, doing push&#8209;ups in preparation for an erotic massage. Methodius and Jovanutz, on the other hand, finally get to see the Pope, and the scene in which Methodius recounts the meeting is, like many other episodes, a classic example of (self&#8209;)irony : &ldquo;The Pope asked us where Moldavia was. And ? And we told him. And what did he say ? When he heard where it was, he said that he wasn&rsquo;t going to get involved at this point in time, but that he&rsquo;d keep in touch&hellip;&rdquo; The humorous and ironic dialogue is one of the book&rsquo;s strong points. This is a seventeenth century where a character can, for example, get away with saying : &ldquo;Hada way wi&rsquo;ye, lad, I see ye like maieutics, divent ye ?&rdquo; The comical situations are similarly punctuated by witty ripostes. For example, on returning from Istanbul and disembarking on what he thinks is Romanian soil, the Voivode Barzovius throws himself into the mud and kisses the ground. The wise Eagle the Spatharius realises that the ship has landed &ldquo;a bit further up&rdquo; than it should have, which is to say on Russian soil, and acidly concludes : &ldquo;Your Highness, I think your kiss was somewhat misplaced&rdquo;. The story is sometimes interrupted by direct addresses to the reader, but also by letters the author has supposedly received from readers during the course of the serialisation. One example is a letter from Aurica Antofie, a &ldquo;pensioner by trade&rdquo;, who, after making a show of her historical knowledge, demands that the author should cease confusing honest people and fooling them into thinking the story presents historical facts : he should either disclose his &ldquo;sources&rdquo; or make a public admission that the whole thing is a fantasy.<br />
Happily, the novel <em>A Hundred Years at the Gates of the Orient </em>has found itself readers who have no need of such detailed explanations : readers who are content with a historical fiction in which narrative acrobatics, playfulness, humour and literary sleight of hand create a total entertainment that captures their attention from the very first to the very last word.</p> <p><strong><i>Episode 1. Of how two worthy monks did fit into one habit</i></strong><br />
<br />
Around 1600 and something, had someone ventured to gaze over the rolling hills beyond Vaslui, he would have descried at a glance two silhouettes walking bent under the untiring blast of the icy Crimean wind. The first figure was tall and pockmarked, with a hooked nose, and jug lugs hidden beneath freshly shorn locks of hair. The second figure seemed shorter, but on closer examination he was revealed to be an extraordinarily tall young man, with bandy legs, freckles, flaxen hair and a furtive eye, who would have made any woman of easy virtue quiver. From their garb, you would have reckoned they were Benedictine monks, except that they were wearing berets on their heads. They walked briskly, now and then anxiously turning back their heads. When they reached Bear&rsquo;s Dell, they stopped for a rest.<br />
&ldquo;Reverend Methodius,&rdquo; spoke the young man shyly, but not without a brief smile at the corner of his mouth, &ldquo;you must be weary after such a journey. Let us rest a while in the Lord.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away !&rdquo; sighed the old man sitting down cross&#8209;legged. &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he continued, getting out something to eat, &ldquo;let us render unto the body what is the body&rsquo;s, for without the body the soul is equal to nought. Tuck in !&rdquo;<br />
Their repast was humble : two sorrel leaves, three prunes, a chunk of cold maize porridge, an onion, and a hastily snared rabbit. But as they were feasting, raising thanks in their minds to the Creator of All, a clatter of hooves grew louder in the valley and as quick as you could clap your hands Bear&rsquo;s Dell was filled with yells. <br />
&ldquo;The Tartars !&rdquo; the old monk had time to cry, hiding the young monk underneath his habit.<br />
The Tartars surrounded them savagely lashing their horses with switches. One of higher rank shouted at the old man :<br />
&ldquo;Shtakryhm, hrykma !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Ma io no capisco !&rdquo; stammered Methodius.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><i>Episode 2. Of how the two monks became acquainted with Tartar customs</i><br />
</strong><br />
Hearing the old man&rsquo;s words, the Tartar screwed up his eyes sideways :<br />
&ldquo;Lei parla italiano ?&rdquo; he asked.<br />
&ldquo;Si, io parlo,&rdquo; replied the frightened Methodius.<br />
The swarthy but handsome face of the Tartar wrinkled in a smile :<br />
&ldquo;Bravo, signore,&rdquo; he said in fluent Italian, &ldquo;my dejected soul rejoices to encounter in these wastes a man of choice education of the spirit, and the sweet sound of words of noble stock, other than barbarous words, is pleasing to my ears.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;How can it be ?&rdquo; wondered Methodius. &ldquo;You know Italian, sir ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;As you can see,&rdquo; replied the Tartar. &ldquo;My father, Khantartar, on seeing me inclined to book learning, sent me to school. I completed my studies in the Classics at Padua last year. Perhaps you are going to ask me what I am doing here. The Italian duchies are going through a horrendous economic crisis, a plague, and in spite of the fact that I have a Degree magna cum laude, I was unable to find a post with any duke. So, I have come back home to the old ways : I plunder the wastelands and find succour in dreams. If your way does not run too aslant to mine and if your heart is not too affrighted by the appearance of my men, then I beg you to be my guest along with your companion, who, if you keep him under your habit much longer, will assuredly suffocate. My camp is nearby.&rdquo;<br />
Indeed, the young monk could scarcely breathe. Ashamed and frightened, he emerged into the light.<br />
&ldquo;Be not afraid, my son,&rdquo; Methodius spoke. &ldquo;The Tartar gentleman is an honest man.&rdquo; Then, turning toward the young khan :<br />
&ldquo;We shall come to you and we shall honour you, but no more, for thoughts other than hospitality impel us on our way. Pulvis et umbra sumus !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Amen !&rdquo; replied the Tartar, spurring his horse.<br />
After a good hour of unsaddled galloping, the horde and the two monks arrived at the Tartar camp. As they passed among the tents, the wonderment of the guests was not little when they saw what strange customs seemed to prevail there. In front of a purple tent, seven young Tartars were queuing, each with a book in his hand. An old Tartar took their books and gave them other new books. On the right, four Tartar women were weeding a bed of Dniester onions, and another two were weaving a carpet with beautiful traditional motifs. Next to a taller tent, the colour of a bustard egg, an almost naked Tartar was bending over a printing press. Finally, in the centre of the camp, posing for a bald icon painter with a thin beard, a superb young Tartar woman was reclining on one side. The light of the sun was mirrored in her deep green eyes as though in slowly moving water.<br />
The heart of the young monk leapt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><i>Episode 3. Of how two young people conversed at the beginning of the seventeenth century</i></strong><br />
<br />
Seeing the gaze of the young monk stealing toward the Tartar woman, the khan bared his teeth, made of gold from the fall of Constantinople (1453), in a narrow, wise smile. <br />
&ldquo;Does she please you ?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Let me introduce you. She is my sister.&rdquo;<br />
The Tartar woman slowly twisted round, like a snake, and two small, coy flames, like two pinheads, darted at the monk.<br />
&ldquo;My name is Huruzuma !&rdquo; she said, with a slight Asiatic accent. &ldquo;What is your name ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Jovanutz !&rdquo; replied the monk simply.<br />
For a moment, their eyes met. &ldquo;Do not tempt me so sorely, O Lord,&rdquo; thought Jovanutz in fright.<br />
&ldquo;Do you come from afar ?&rdquo; she asked him.<br />
&ldquo;From roundabout !&rdquo; he replied evasively.<br />
Somewhere a blackbird began to sing. A breeze was blowing and it smelled sweet enough to make you swoon.<br />
&ldquo;We shall now leave you for a moment,&rdquo; said the khan. Then, turning toward Methodius : &ldquo;Let us go, father. I want to show you my harem.&rdquo;<br />
They moved away. The youngsters were left alone.<br />
&ldquo;Sit down !&rdquo; said the Tartar woman. &ldquo;Relax. You must be tired. Have you been travelling long ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Enormously long !&rdquo; said Jovanutz timidly.<br />
&ldquo;But why do you travel around so much ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Men are like coin. The best coin travels in every land.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Where is it you are coming from now ?&rdquo;<br />
Jovanutz cautiously raised his head, gazed carefully around him, and slowly said :<br />
&ldquo;Will you tell anyone ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What ! Are you a child ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;From Rome !&rdquo; he whispered. The blackbird suddenly fell silent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><i>Episode 4. On the way to the harem</i></strong><br />
<br />
Leaving the two youngsters to feed on each other&rsquo;s gaze and to spin their yarn, the khan and Methodius sauntered leisurely towards the harem.<br />
&ldquo;Signore,&rdquo; said Methodius in a lowered voice, &ldquo;we are now sauntering leisurely towards the harem. I can understand you, for you are in your prime and you must have seven lives in that bronze breast of yours&hellip; But I&hellip; in a harem&hellip; if you will forgive me&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Amore, more, ore, re probantur amicitiae !&rdquo; answered the Tartar smiling. &ldquo;Or are you worried that you will lose your soul ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh, the soul ! It&rsquo;s not the soul I&rsquo;m worried about,&rdquo; said the monk dreamily. &ldquo;Animi Volant, corpora manent, as the prophets said. It&rsquo;s the body I&rsquo;m worried about. The body &ndash; that unknown quantity.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You Danube folk certainly are strange !&rdquo; the Tartar meditated.<br />
&ldquo;Thus was it written for us, that we should have the ease of the wind and the inconstancy of the waters. But we are not complaining. We endure. We exist. All of us. Here today, tomorrow in Focshani, what we have had and what we have lost.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve arrived,&rdquo; said the Tartar, indicating the door of the harem, on which a traditional Tartar coat of arms was traced : an ox head impaled on the tip of a spear.<br />
Under the coat of arms, there was an old Asiatic dictum, written in scrawled letters : &ldquo;Inter arma silent musae&rdquo;.<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going in,&rdquo; said the monk decisively.<br />
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go in, then I will,&rdquo; said the Tartar menacingly.<br />
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go in too,&rdquo; said Methodius.<br />
And so they went in. Inside there was darkness. A scent of pineapple struck them. Methodius was cautiously advancing when, in a corner, a door slowly opened, through which filtered a languorous ray of light. Methodius hesitated for a moment, bashfully approached the door, blinked his eyes and &hellip; what should he see ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><i>Episode 5. A Model Harem</i></strong><br />
<br />
Entering the door masked by the superb body of a young Tartar woman, masked by the massive body of a eunuch, Methodius stopped on the threshold, his eyes boggling : in a room plunged in pleasant semi&#8209;darkness, whence purled the sweet sounds of a lyre, seven young Tartar women, all alike, were stooping around a strange machine. In one corner, resting on some pillows and puffing on an ivory pipe gracefully held by a eunuch, an old Tartar, completely shaven and tattooed on his chest with both the cross of Saint George and the crescent moon, sat deep in thought.<br />
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that ?&rdquo; stammered Methodius, pointing at the machine.<br />
&ldquo;A printing press, mon cher !&rdquo; the young khan explained.<br />
&ldquo;And what is it you are printing ?&rdquo; said Methodius, pleasantly surprised.<br />
&ldquo;Psalters, homilies, lexicons, &lsquo;The History of the Ottoman Empire&rsquo;, the part about the rise of the empire.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, but what about the girls ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;They do the proofreading.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And what about&hellip; him ?&rdquo; he whispered, peeking from the corner of his eye at the tattooed Tartar.<br />
&ldquo;Him ? He won the &lsquo;From hundreds of Tartars&rsquo; competition. Let me introduce you. His name is Myrzak.&rdquo;<br />
They went closer.<br />
&ldquo;I observe that, in spite of the worldly things around you, the mind is not affrighted beneath the burden of enticements,&rdquo; Methodius gently spoke to Myrzak. <br />
&ldquo;A pleasant rumour cometh to mine ears,&rdquo; said Myrzak without raising his head. &ldquo;Wonder not, stranger, that the sweetness of temptation no longer tests me. For there is no pastime more useful than the reading of books.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You speak truly,&rdquo; answered Methodius. &ldquo;But methinks that you too were young once and you perhaps knew the flower of sin.&rdquo;<br />
At these words, Myrzak smiled bitterly and, by way of an answer, showed his left shoulder, on which were tattooed the words : YULISHKA, MOHACI, 1526.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><i>Episode 6. Of what else two young people discussed at the beginning of the seventeenth century</i></strong><br />
<br />
While the khan and Methodius were visiting the harem, Jovanutz, the young monk, and Huruzuma, the foster sister of the Tartar, had remained alone.<br />
&ldquo;So you mean to say you&rsquo;ve been to Rome !&rdquo; said the Tartar girl, rolling her r&rsquo;s, getting up sideways.<br />
Jovanutz did not dare to gaze upon her directly. The puritanical education he had received in the house of his parents, serfs of the Neamtz region, an education according to which a woman should know her place, and not recline on her side, made him tend to avoid such perilous advances.<br />
&ldquo;And as I was saying,&rdquo; continued Huruzuma, &ldquo;you mean to say that you are coming back from Rome, no ? Why don&rsquo;t you answer ?&rdquo;<br />
The young monk at last raised his eyes, preparing to answer politely but firmly, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m coming back from Rome&rdquo;, but the Tartar girl did not let him begin, but rather went on :<br />
&ldquo;How happy you must be, master Jovanutz ! To travel so widely and to see so much ! Whereas I&hellip; always on the steppe. I look to the right : steppe. I look to the left : steppe. I look up above&hellip; what else is there to say !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Y&#8209;yes !&rdquo; said Jovanutz in his mind, nonetheless espying the curving point of Huruzuma&rsquo;s boot as it playfully moved amid the lush grass that grew there by the Dniester illo tempore.<br />
&ldquo;I get terribly bored !&rdquo; sighed the Tartar girl, looking around her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pointless knowing how to read and write. I don&rsquo;t have anyone to exchange impressions with, to exchange views with, except my brother. Master Jovanutz, don&rsquo;t get the wrong impression of me, but I&rsquo;m only human. I would like to travel, to open my soul to someone&hellip; You know, master monk, I&rsquo;ve never been to the seaside&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
Jovanutz stood with his head bowed, toying with a tassel on his habit. Huruzuma&rsquo;s confessions perturbed him greatly.<br />
&ldquo;But apart from that,&rdquo; Huruzuma went on gaily, all of a sudden, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a not a bad life all in all. In the evening we make a campfire, throw on brushwood, joke, laugh, sing&hellip; Would you like me to sing you something ?&rdquo;<br />
And without waiting for permission, Huruzuma threw her head back and began to sing in a sonorous, high, pleasant voice :<br />
&ldquo;We exalt thee, glorious Baikal&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><i>Episode 7. Prattle not without significance</i></strong><br />
<br />
Having been enlightened as to the wholly noble purposes of the printing&#8209;press&#8209;harem, Methodius, whose autumnal body had seen many springs, felt the need to rest.<br />
&ldquo;I do not tire of praising the general zeal I see here,&rdquo; he said to the Tartar. &ldquo;My eyes are gladdened, my heart uplifted. But to tell you the truth, great khan, my unworthy legs are far removed from my mind and will not heed me. Would I err overly if, seeing that wonderful chair over there, I desired to sit and, behold, I did just that ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied the Tartar, bowing. &ldquo;We ourselves treasure sitting down. Sedentariness, when it comes from within, presages rising, just as rising precedes the fall. Sit, reverend, be well, for soon you will rise up.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Ibi bene, ubi sum, as the prophets say !&rdquo; Methodius sighed with pleasure.<br />
&ldquo;Tuzuma,&rdquo; the young khan turned to a nearby eunuch, &ldquo;please bring us a cup of kumas.&rdquo;<br />
Rustling lightly, the eunuch vanished and returned with two whitish chalices.<br />
&ldquo;You know, great khan,&rdquo; said Methodius after tasting from the cup, &ldquo;looking through your psalters, I observe that the poetic line is neither long nor short but just right. A marvellous thing : as many iambs, as many dactyls.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We are a young culture,&rdquo; replied the Tartar, also taking a seat. &ldquo;As you see, we have started from very little. What am I saying ? From nothing. Now judge for yourself : could I have allowed free verse ? Great poetry must have rhythm. Where there is no rhythm, there is no poetics, and can a poetry say anything without poetics ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Methodius. &ldquo;I understand and I am filled with wonder. May God grant you health !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo; said the Tartar, lowering his eyes embarrassed. &ldquo;To your health !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Heaven be praised !&rdquo; replied Methodius and drained his cup.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><i>Episode 8. In which honest thanks is bestowed upon the reader and noteworthy new faces appear</i></strong><br />
<br />
Allow us, Reader, as thou with trusting care dost pore over these lines, to make pause. And do thou too draw thy breath, rest thy eyes and let them glide swiftly over the words, for we have not anything to say of that which commonly might retain thy attention. Have faith in us : we shall not lead thee from thy ways into temptation. We no longer tell our tale, but rather indulge in a little rhetoric. Sit thee down beside us and stretch thy limbs for a moment. As writing doth weary us, so reading doth thee. Ut pictura, lectura. Seek thou not ruthlessly for meanings and motives where they elude the chronicler himself, but lolling in the shade of ripening tales, set aside thy red pencil in the grass and gaze with gentle, sleepy eyes upon the fine phrase I have fashioned. Thus !<br />
* * *<br />
Let us now leave Methodius, the khan, Jovanutz and Huruzuma for a while, to enjoy the sweetness of camp life, and let us cast our gaze across the steppe. What do we descry ? Arise, Reader !<br />
<br />
At a certain distance from the camp, three men on horseback were approaching slowly, at a walking pace. The horses could barely continue ; the riders could barely hold themselves in the saddle. The one in the middle, stouter, bearded, well dressed, with a marten&#8209;skin cap on his head, was sighing and kept looking behind him. He had two companions : one tall, broad&#8209;shouldered, with a grim countenance, the other quite young. <br />
&ldquo;Leave off these black thoughts, illustrious lord !&rdquo; spoke the broad&#8209;shouldered one. &ldquo;The times do not stand beneath men, but men beneath the times. Yesterday you were, today you are no longer. Yesterday you resided, today you wander.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Alas, Spatharius Eagle !&rdquo; lamented the fat one, tugging his beard, &ldquo;If only I had managed to take my books !&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><i>Episode 9. After the fall</i></strong><br />
<br />
&ldquo;Do not take it amiss, great Lord, if I speak freely, but you used to sit far too much with your nose in those books !&rdquo; spoke Eagle the Spatharius to the fat one with the marten&#8209;fur cap. &ldquo;You would be reading and we would be collecting the taxes. Was there any justice in that ? The Poles would come, and you would be reading. The Tartars would be laying waste, and you would be reading. The Cossacks would be ravaging, and you would be writing. It was lucky the Turks came and deposed you, because I for one had had enough.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I wanted to be enlightened,&rdquo; lamented the one with the marten&#8209;fur cap, barely managing to stay in the saddle. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to cut off heads, I wanted to enlighten them.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;The sword cuts off the enlightened head,&rdquo; said Eagle the Spatharius, gazing into the distance. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t cut it off, then others will. Let there be heads, for there are swords aplenty.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Alas, how you speak to me, Spatharius Eagle ! The day before yesterday, you would not have dared to raise your voice higher than where sits your head.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Different times, different voices, illustrious lord !&rdquo; said the spatharius. &ldquo;I would have raised my voice in vain if you did not lower your ear. The rabble were shouting outside but you heard them not. You would be muttering away in Latin.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Why were they shouting, spatharius ?&rdquo; lamented the fat one. &ldquo;I built them schools, I brought them a printing press, I gave them a theatre.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You gave them a theatre to look at from the outside, because not one of them would go in, they were afraid. Serfs in the theatre ! Whoever has seen the like ? Boyars, courtiers, you can get away with, but serfs ! You, illustrious lord, forgive me for saying it, dreamt you were on the Tiber, when it was the Bahlui that flowed but two steps away !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Alas, alas !&rdquo; moaned the fat one. &ldquo;Alas, alas ! Don&rsquo;t remind me ! How shameful ! How they tumbled me into it, like a boulder !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Turks for you,&rdquo; said the spatharius. &ldquo;Lucky the water was shallow and you have large loins. But even so, if poor Broante&#351; and myself hadn&rsquo;t been loyal to you, you would have departed into the world of the righteous. Am I or am I not right, Broante&#351; ?&rdquo; added the spatharius, turning in the saddle toward the other travelling companion, who was listening carefully, plunged in thought.<br />
&ldquo;Uhuhuhhuh !&rdquo; went Broante&#351;.<br />
&ldquo;You see, illustrious Lord ?&rdquo; said the spatharius to the fat one. &ldquo;What use is it having learnt poetic utterance if they&rsquo;ve cut your tongue out ? Wouldn&rsquo;t he have been better off if you&rsquo;d left him at home to plough ?&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><i>Episode 10. An emotional reunion</i></strong><br />
<br />
And as the three were making their escape over the steppe and talking (that is, only two of them were talking, since, as we have already mentioned, the third companion, due to one of those unfortunate events that have so often determined the fate of the Danubian rhapsodes, had had a goodly portion of his tongue cut off), they came to a grove. Suddenly, the mare of Eagle the Spatharius whinnied and reared up on her hind legs.<br />
&ldquo;Ho, Laika, ho ! There aren&rsquo;t any Tartars !&rdquo; Eagle quieted his mare, lightly patting her on the neck.<br />
&ldquo;Oh but there are !&rdquo; came a shout from the grove and dozens of Tartars camouflaged in bushes surrounded our heroes, raising their bows.<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot, comrades !&rdquo; Eagle swiftly cried. &ldquo;We are honest folk !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Shut it !&rdquo; one of the higher&#8209;up bushes shouted at him. &ldquo;Here, you speak when you&rsquo;re spoken to ! What are you doing on our lands ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; said Eagle the Spatharius. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go by the way we look, for our fate has been harsh. We are bigwigs, boyars. Take us to your leader.&rdquo;<br />
The bush rustled undecidedly :<br />
&ldquo;Listen, scarecrow, if you&rsquo;re lying and if you&rsquo;re not who you say you are, and if you bother the khan for nothing, your mare will weep for pity.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Be it as you say, honourable Tartar,&rdquo; replied the spatharius.<br />
When the Tartar cohort and their fresh prisoners entered the camp, the young khan, his sister Huruzuma and the two Moldavian monks were enjoying some kumas. The head bush came to a stop in front of the khan :<br />
&ldquo;Ham urai stahal kumas !&rdquo; he announced.<br />
&ldquo;He has captured three wayfarers and has the right to a cup of kumas,&rdquo; the khan interpreted for Methodius.<br />
The latter raised his head to see the prisoners and froze.<br />
&ldquo;What do my eyes see ?&rdquo; he cried, leaping from his chair. &ldquo;Can it be true ? Is it you, illustrious Lord ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Worthy Methodius ! You &ndash; here ?&rdquo; exclaimed the one with the marten&#8209;fur cap. &ldquo;Mother of God preserve me ! It is I, your holiness ! Even I !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;In such a plight !&rdquo; said Methodius, amazed. &ldquo;But for what deeds ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;How should I know ? Apparently in payment for the fact that I&hellip;&rdquo; but here the fat one was unable to continue, for he burst out weeping.<br />
&ldquo;Nullius tantum flumen est ingenii, nullius dicendi aut scribendi tanta vis, tanta copia, quae non dicam exornare, sed enarrare, res tuas gestas possit, illustrious Lord !&rdquo; said the Tartar, profoundly moved. <br />
&ldquo;Thank you very much !&rdquo; replied the one with the marten&#8209;fur cap, wiping his eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><i>Episode 11. The turbid waters become somewhat more limpid</i></strong><br />
<br />
On beholding such a strange reunion, every soul in the Tartar camp, young and old, with their dogs, with their piglets, gathered around the Moldavians, as curious as could be.<br />
&ldquo;As you say, reverend Methodius !&rdquo; said Eagle the Spatharius, dismounting embarrassed, for the little Tartars, like children anywhere in the world, were romping next to him and poking him with their toy swords. &ldquo;We thought you were in Rome, but here you are at the Gates of the Orient.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We have been to Rome, we were there,&rdquo; Methodius hastened to say, shaking the spatharius&rsquo; hand and kissing it. &ldquo;We were there, and we spoke with them.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And what did they say ?&rdquo; asked the fat one hopefully, having remained mounted on his horse.<br />
&ldquo;Well, what could they say ? As if you yourself don&rsquo;t know what they say,&rdquo; said Eagle in Methodius&rsquo; stead. &ldquo;That we&rsquo;ll see, that we&rsquo;ll do it, that it&rsquo;ll be tonsured, that it&rsquo;ll be shaved, shilly&#8209;shally, come back later, long live Latinity, whatever, pleasantries. What would they need a Romanian school there for ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You are not far from the truth, Eagle,&rdquo; said Methodius. &ldquo;Except that you see it from only one side. The truth, spatharius, is an old oak&#8209;tree : the more you look at it from different sides, the more you realise that it has many hollows.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;As you will, reverend !&rdquo; replied Eagle.<br />
Then, turning to the fat one :<br />
&ldquo;Your worship, if you unburdened that horse of your august weight, would it not be better not only for your rump but also for the soul of this worthy beast ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I shall dismount, for thus was it written for me,&rdquo; sighed the fat one, looking in fright at the little Tartars who were gesturing with their toy swords for him to come down.<br />
&ldquo;Illustrious khan,&rdquo; said Eagle raising his head. &ldquo;Allow me to introduce you to the Voievod Barzovius, formerly prince, banished the day before yesterday, for reasons which may escape you but not me. But let us leave that to one side. If you will, honour him, for as you see his body, such is his heart.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Welcome to the fair climes of Tartardom !&rdquo; said the young khan, all smiles, advancing to greet them.<br />
&ldquo;Which is the voievod ?&rdquo; whispered Huruzuma, who was standing some way off with Jovanutz, gripping him tightly by the hand.<br />
Under his habit, Jovanutz quivered from the top of his head to the tips of his toes. He had never felt the like before.<br />
&ldquo;Look, that&rsquo;s him !&rdquo; he whispered, thrilled.</p>

9 Our Circus Presents: Circul nostru va prezinta: Novel "Ego Prose" series, Polirom, 2007 (2nd revised edition), 216 pages Polirom Dalkey Archive Press (USA), Sphinx Publishing (Egypt), LHarmattan Kiado (Hungary), Aisara (Italy) <p>The main character of the book, a man of thirty, lives in a modest flat on the fifth floor of a housing block. Every Sunday, the protagonist performs a kind of ritual : he climbs onto the window ledge and waits for a suicidal urge, which, however, never comes.<br />
The events of the novel unfold over the course of three days. On the first day, the young man sets off to the town&rsquo;s railway station in search of prostitutes. On the way, he runs into another young man, known during the story as the &ldquo;bloke with the orange braces&rdquo;, who has hanged himself from an old steam engine in an unused siding. The protagonist saves him and takes him to the station hospital, from where the bloke with the orange braces discharges himself on his own two feet. The main character will later find the man he saved in a railway workers&rsquo; bar. He is unwillingly embroiled in a fight provoked by the bloke with the orange braces, who breaks a chair over the head of one of the prostitutes in the bar, leaving her in a pool of blood. For the second time in the space of the same day, the protagonist saves the bloke with the orange braces, this time from the fury of the drinkers in the bar, and takes him back to his own flat. This is where the entire atmosphere of the story takes shape : a disabused world of strange neighbours and a building superintendent who is an old woman yearning for a relationship with a young man of thirty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the other two days covered by the action of the novel, we discover that the young protagonist is a member of a kind of club for &ldquo;professional suicides&rdquo; &ndash; people in search of death, sometimes for the most stupid reasons and in the most bizarre ways : one wants to kill himself by sleeping with as many women of easy virtue as possible, in the hope of contracting a fatal disease ; another wants to commit suicide by drinking huge quantities of the finest quality whiskey, until he falls into an alcoholic coma ; etc. They are all &ldquo;suicide artists&rdquo;, and it is into this strange group that the young man of thirty would now like to introduce his new friend. Parallel to these events, the two attempt to find out whether the prostitute in the bar has managed to survive being hit over the head with a chair. The answer will not be revealed until the end of the novel.<br />
The finale closes the circle of the tale : during a further visit to the railway station, the protagonist discovers that the prostitute has died. He does not tell his new friend about this. At the same time, however, frightened at the turn that events have taken, he comes up with a plan : he convinces the bloke with the orange braces to go to the station, to the locomotive where he first found him. And he proposes that they both commit suicide. The young man tells his companion that in this way the railway workers will understand that they both regret the incident with the prostitute &ndash; and they will be forgiven. In fact, the protagonist&rsquo;s plan is to free himself from the noose and to chase away anyone who tries to save the other, allowing him to die and thereby escaping from any legal consequences of his association with the prostitute&rsquo;s murderer. The plan fails, however, for various reasons &ndash; the protagonist does not allow his new friend to die, but rather tells him the truth about the prostitute and about what he has been planning. It all ends with a roar of laughter, an agonised roar of laughter which consecrates the general principle and theme of the book, according to which whoever has failed at everything else in life can only be consistent and fail at his own death.</p> <p>There are days &ndash; what am I saying : months ! &ndash; when I desperately wait for events, praying for something the hell to happen, hoping for some phone call to wrench me out of the numbness, to inform me that, somewhere in this apparently so immobile world, something is happening worthy of my attention. But the phone call does not come, however much I pine away waiting for it.<br />
But when events are determined to assail you from every side, it is no longer any surprise at all when your phone rings. Moreover, it is absolutely no surprise when you hear that the first words from the other end of the line are :<br />
&ldquo;Today is the day !&rdquo;<br />
Indeed. What could be surprising in that, when in the last few hours you have saved someone from death twice, you have witnessed the possible murder of a prostitute, you have slept in the same room as the presumed murderer and, at the same time, subsequent suicide, you have visited an ex&#8209;girlfriend, more than fifteen years older than yourself, and, the cherry on the cake, you have dared to call that ex&#8209;girlfriend &ldquo;madam&rdquo; ?<br />
I myself had been thinking that today is the day : it is the day that comes after yesterday, the day on which I&rsquo;ll continue to have to put up with a series of questions whose answer I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m capable of finding, the day on which I&rsquo;ll be swinging between regrets and curiosity. But, recognising the voice at the other end of the line, I realise that this day brings something extra with it : the respectable madness of my pal the former theologian, who is thinking of killing himself by drinking whiskey until he enters an alcoholic coma.<br />
Lately, he has told me about this intention of his countless times. And I, naturally, admired him for the idea (just as I had admired him before that for the idea with the prostitutes). However, also taking into account the fact that he would never manage to save up enough money to buy ten litres of the finest whiskey, as he would have wished. The time when he worked for a private firm, with a more than satisfactory wage, had passed. Once, just once since he was laid off, he managed &ndash; from his dole money, which he was still receiving at the time, and from his work as an amateur dogcatcher &ndash; to put aside a sum sufficient for three litres. He phoned me up then too. And he set about drinking, happy. All the while he talked to me about suicide. Philosophically, pathetically, but at the same time enthusiastically, as though it were a question of the supreme creative act of which man might be capable. In the end, in order to justify his claim, he went on to biblical arguments :<br />
&ldquo;Maybe you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;but the Bible presents God as having four essential qualities : firstly, through the way in which he acts toward the Pharaoh at the moment the Jews are freed from bondage in Egypt, God proves to be a powerful, fear&#8209;inspiring force. Also through the liberation of the Jews and, above all, through the way in which he resolves that situation, He proves His wisdom. Through the punishment He inflicts upon those who have persecuted His people, God manifests his justice. Then, we discover a third quality in His respect for the promise He made as regards the descendants of Abraham and in His entire behaviour to His people. The fourth principal quality is therefore love. Get it ?&rdquo;<br />
I had understood the bit about the qualities. But I couldn&rsquo;t see what it was he was getting at. I nodded, as though I had been fully edified.<br />
&ldquo;Proceeding from this summary characterisation,&rdquo; he continued his idea, &ldquo;We could find an answer to the question &lsquo;Why the hell did God create the world ?&rsquo; What do you think, could we ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We could.&rdquo;<br />
What else could I say ?<br />
&ldquo;Well, no, my friend, look but we couldn&rsquo;t. How the devil could we ! Let&rsquo;s take the first quality of God : power. Why did God need to manifest his power over mortals ? Why did He have to create the Earth and mankind, when, as the Bible says, He had previously created the angels ? Therefore He already had someone He could show off His power to. Here&rsquo;s the problem, but pay attention : in distinction to angels, the Creator offered humans the possibility of multiplying, evolving, learning, choosing. He gave humans a part of Himself, making them creators in their turn. And also in distinction to the angels, man was also offered the right to be disobedient. So, God&rsquo;s power was manifested to us as to subjects, which is what angels are, but only as payment for the war man has started against the divinity. Think about the times when God has revealed His power. To Cain, who committed murder. To the Pharaoh. To the rulers of His people, when they defied Him. It can therefore be said that His power only manifests itself in self&#8209;defence. In conclusion, to the question &lsquo;Did God create the world in order to have someone to manifest His power to ?&rsquo; I can answer you without hesitation that He didn&rsquo;t. Because, in the beginning, He had no intention of showing His power to mankind. He was obliged to do so. Well then !&rdquo;<br />
My pal the former theologian paused for a few seconds, probably to gather his booze&#8209;addled thoughts.<br />
&ldquo;But let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; he went on finally, &ldquo;how things stand with the second quality, wisdom. Do you really think that the world was born out of vanity, out of the desire of an absolute awareness, such as God, to prove its wisdom before much inferior existences ? His wisdom helped Him to build the world, yes, but the display of that wisdom was is no case one of the purposes for the appearance of the world. How much could the appreciation of some ignorant wretches have pleased Him, the embodiment of wisdom to the maximum degree ? Not at all, don&rsquo;t you think ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, how could it ?&rdquo; I nodded, more and more bored by his explanation.<br />
&ldquo;Another quality of God is justice, as I&rsquo;ve already told you. As God&rsquo;s first creation, namely the angels, had been conceived in order to live in justice, it can be presupposed, forcing the argument it is true, that God created man in order to be able to manifest His spirit of justice. Though slightly fatuous, this claim might, nonetheless, be taken into account. However, in the very first chapter of Genesis, we discover that God declares Himself satisfied with His creation, regarding it as very good. As he was referring to His creation in Paradise, it seems quite clear that He was satisfied with what He saw at that moment. It might therefore be considered that the temptation of Adam and Eve had not been foreseen by the divinity. In other words, not even His redemptive wish had been part of the purpose for creating the world, as long as, when He declared Himself satisfied with what He had made, sin did not yet exist. It therefore remains to be seen how things stand with the fourth quality of God.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; I interrupted, from a desire to contribute something to the discussion.<br />
&ldquo;Yes, love. I see you remember. Did the One Above need love, and was that why He created us ? No, my friend, the angels loved Him too. So, it&rsquo;s clear that it wasn&rsquo;t a need for love that made Him invent man. Tell me, then : why the devil did God create the world ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;How should I know ?&rdquo;<br />
He was already drunk and terribly incensed, and it seemed to me that his entire philosophy had completely lost any coherence. Ultimately, after all that prattle about God and the world, he had arrived back at the same question as at the beginning.<br />
However, although he was already seriously reeling, and his eyes had begun to dart about rather strangely in their sockets, my pal proved capable of resuming his discourse :<br />
&ldquo;You see, if you weren&rsquo;t paying attention ? Well, didn&rsquo;t I mention at one point that, in the very first chapter of Genesis, God declares Himself satisfied with His work ? That&rsquo;s the secret, my friend. Imagine a painter or any other kind of artist, who, when he finishes his work, is enthused by the idea he had and looks on the result with satisfaction, murmuring to himself : &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a good piece of work&rsquo;. Although he knows that the difficult task of putting the finishing touches is still to come, he rejoices at the thought that what he has before him is his own work, born of his own idea and brought to fulfilment by him alone. You see ? Like the artist, God created something and put His name to His creation. And, above all, like the artist, God had no purpose, no reason for creating the world. But people have always posed the question : why were we created, after all ? And, since the simplest answer, which is to say &ldquo;just because&rdquo;, didn&rsquo;t suit anybody, philosophy came into being. And philosophy led to evolution. Now, at last, do you see why God created the world ? Just because !&rdquo;<br />
After that discussion, I often thought about my pal&rsquo;s explanation and I discovered a host of meanings, each one of them equivalent to a revelation. But I hadn&rsquo;t understood anything at the time. And nonetheless, I said :<br />
&ldquo;Yes, I see. Except that I don&rsquo;t see what connection it has with your suicide.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wasting my breath on you, in that case. Well, how the devil could it not have a connection ! ? My suicide is an artistic act, my friend. And, like any artistic act, it has no motivation. Or, if it has, it&rsquo;s not one that just anyone can discover.&rdquo;<br />
And then, suddenly distracted, he added :<br />
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, you see, you&rsquo;ll never succeed in killing yourself.&rdquo;<br />
My indignation, aroused by the sneering smile with which he accompanied that assertion, could, I think, be heard far from his abode.<br />
&ldquo;Who the fuck made you think you&rsquo;re cleverer than me ! ? How&rsquo;s that : you succeed in killing yourself, but you don&rsquo;t credit me with any chance at all ! ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Exactly. Look, let me demonstrate it to you. What reasons have you got to kill yourself ?&rdquo;<br />
What reasons did I have ? That was a stupid question, to which I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have given him any answer. Nonetheless, I said :<br />
&ldquo;Do you know what I would like from life ? A beautiful woman to take care of me and to have sex with me until I feel I can take no more. In fact no, a lot of beautiful women to take care of me and have sex with me until I feel I can take no more. I wouldn&rsquo;t say no to a hefty inheritance from some uncle in the West &ndash; not that I have one. I&rsquo;d also like to be a footballer. Those footballers are the richest people in uniform. I&rsquo;d probably quite like to loll around in bed all my life watching television, eating, having sex and reading. Or &ndash; aha, yes, most of all ! &ndash; to invent a device, a kind of magnet, to attract all the money lost by all the people in the world. Not all the money lost throughout time, I&rsquo;m not that pretentious, but, let&rsquo;s say, over a fixed period : over the course of a month. Well, you see, not one of these things, not one of my wishes is ever going to come true. That&rsquo;s why I want to kill myself !&rdquo;<br />
My whiskey&#8209;drinking pal complemented his smile with a roar of laughter.<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given yourself away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now do you see why I told you that you&rsquo;d never kill yourself ? Because you have too many motives. That&rsquo;s the main, in fact the sole motive a normal person should have for killing himself : not to have any motive. Because behind each of those motives lies hidden a wish. And any wish, believe me, brings with it some hope of fulfilment. If God had had such easily detectible motives for creating the world, I tell you that the Earth would not exist today. Because God is too clever not to have realised the idea I&rsquo;ve just laid out to you.&rdquo;<br />
I agreed with him. And I agreed with him so much that the discussion was followed by a greatly enhanced consequence of the morning&rsquo;s outbursts on the ledge. So, in expectation of the urge, I strove to find out whether I have wishes or not. The window ledge thus became a kind of barometer of desires.<br />
As for him ? He drank a bottle of whiskey after that. Consequently, he got drunk enough for his sexual appetite to make him abandon the other two bottles and leave the house in search of a woman.<br />
And, as he didn&rsquo;t have any money for prostitutes, that evening he stopped in front of every person of the female sex that came his way, and said to them, seriously reeling :<br />
&ldquo;Would you like to make love with me ? After that, if you don&rsquo;t like it, I can commit suicide.&rdquo;<br />
Of that event I remember that the next day, when he awoke from his drunken stupor, he told me over the telephone :<br />
&ldquo;Look, my friend, didn&rsquo;t I tell you last night ? Desires stifle any appetite to kill yourself ! It just so happened that I slept with a woman&hellip; Farewell suicide !&rdquo;<br />
* * *<br />
&ldquo;Today is the day !&rdquo; the voice at the other end of the line now solemnly resounds.<br />
And, for all that I know what he is referring to, since the entire relationship between us is based on a single point in common, the only way I can react is to ask mechanically :<br />
&ldquo;What day ?&rdquo;<br />
I hear a mutter of annoyance.<br />
&ldquo;What do you mean, what day ? Haven&rsquo;t I told you about it umpteen times ? It&rsquo;s the day on which I&rsquo;ve managed to buy enough whiskey to kill an elephant. Are you interested ?&rdquo;<br />
This time, although I haven&rsquo;t the slightest doubt about namely what should interest me, I don&rsquo;t answer mechanically, but only out of a pointless desire to banter with him :<br />
&ldquo;The whiskey ?&rdquo;<br />
More muttering, more annoyance &ndash; an infantile satisfaction for me.<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only for me, my friend, as you know full well. Are you interested in coming to see me kill myself ?&rdquo;<br />
This isn&rsquo;t a case of a wedding that you don&rsquo;t have enough money to go to and so you excuse yourself by claiming to have a heavy cold. Nor is it a case of a birthday party, which you have reasons not to go to because you don&rsquo;t like music at full volume or people dancing when you don&rsquo;t know any kind of dance. This is a case of witnessing a suicide. And such an invitation, as everyone must agree, is hard to refuse. Even if accepting it would lead to having to listen to another interminable lecture about God and His four essential qualities and about unprecedented artistic acts. You can easily tolerate something of the sort, when you think that the opportunity of witnessing a suicide in the fullest sense doesn&rsquo;t crop up very often in your life. What else can we say : you would have to be completely mad not to take advantage of it ! Except that for me there is a hitch :<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not available.&rdquo;<br />
I&rsquo;m talking nonsense. If she could hear me, my former neighbour would be right in imagining that between myself and him with the orange braces there is much more than a mere friendship. <br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not alone,&rdquo; I hastily correct myself.<br />
&ldquo;Well, this is something I never expected you to say. You&rsquo;re thinking of missing such an opportunity for the sake of a woman ?&rdquo; marvelled the voice at the other end of the line.<br />
Not for a woman, no. In fact, not for anyone. All I want at the present time is to convince my whiskey&#8209;drinking pal to invite the person I&rsquo;ve spent the last twenty hours with as well. Although I haven&rsquo;t asked my friend with the orange braces whether he wants to come, I&rsquo;m convinced that, like myself, he wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss such a moment.<br />
&ldquo;I have a guest. A friend. Couldn&rsquo;t he come with me ?&rdquo;<br />
He mutters again, expressing for the third time his annoyance in this way.<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really want to. It&rsquo;s a personal act : you know how I see it. You&rsquo;re welcome, bearing in mind&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s one of us !&rdquo; I interrupt, hoping thereby to convince him.<br />
In the next instant I cannot but wonder what the hell I meant by that. What did that &ldquo;one of us&rdquo; mean, which I uttered so nonchalantly ? Had some kind of caste of suicides been created in my mind, of which I too was an honourable member ? Stranger still is that the mind of the one at the other end of the line seems to be on the same wavelength as mine. Because to my friend, who today has decided to put an end to his life, this &ldquo;one of us&rdquo; seems as natural as can be, given that he concludes, with relief :<br />
&ldquo;Ah, alright ! In that case, I can&rsquo;t see any reason not to bring him along.&rdquo; (&hellip;)<br />
* * *<br />
Even if the atmosphere ought to be relaxed, bearing in mind the fact that it overlaps with a number of unexpected achievements in the life of my friend the former theologian, I feel something weighing on my chest. I don&rsquo;t know what. Anyhow, this feeling becomes sharper the moment I see our host pouring coffee into the cup of my friend with the orange braces, whose presence I have quite forgotten in the last few minutes.<br />
&ldquo;Sugar ?&rdquo; the one who has invited us asks, as affable as ever.<br />
&ldquo;Instead of coffee,&rdquo; I hear my companion say, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t you give us both a cup of whiskey ?&rdquo;<br />
And here is the explanation for the pressing sensation in my chest ! For the third time in the last few hours, the voice of the assistant at the dispensary suddenly resounds in my ears : &ldquo;If you give him a brandy, he&rsquo;ll tell you everything.&rdquo; How could I have forgotten ? I realise &ndash; a little too late, it is true &ndash; that I have made a mistake in bringing my guest here. The other also thinks the same thing, goggling his eyes, utterly stupefied. Then, ignoring the one I have come with, he snaps at me :<br />
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell him what I want to do ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;<br />
I am genuinely scared at what might come of the gaffe made by the one with orange braces. What if we get chucked out ? How the hell could I have forgotten ? There&rsquo;s no doubt about it : I&rsquo;m to blame. I should have pointed out to my friend that he should restrain himself, however much that bucket of alcohol might tempt him.<br />
&ldquo;He was joking,&rdquo; I say, trying to mend the situation and at the same time pinching my companion&rsquo;s thigh with all my might.<br />
&ldquo;What the hell&rsquo;s got into you ?&rdquo; says the latter, jumping up from his chair and rubbing the spot where I nipped him.<br />
And as I&rsquo;m endeavouring to give him a conspiring wink, he unexpectedly clouts me across the face, a slap strong enough to topple me onto the carpet, chair and all. In the seconds in which I try to come back to my senses, reason, crammed into one corner of my mind, demands that I should not react, that I should behave normally, especially given the fact that I&rsquo;m not in my own house. Unfortunately, however, reason has very few other courses of action to dictate to me, and so, once I&rsquo;m on my feet, I reply with all my force, punching my aggressor. In the sudden welter, I nevertheless manage to see my frightened whiskey&#8209;drinking friend grab the bucket, cradling it in his arms to protect it. This move comes too late, however. In the next moment, the one with the orange braces, roaring, rushes at me, shoving the former theologian, who, with the bucket in his arms, had just thrust himself between us. So it happens that, as we are rolling on the carpet, chaotically slugging each other, fighting without any well&#8209;founded reason, a drawn&#8209;out moan fills the room&hellip;<br />
At that moment, as though on cue, we cease the fight that had erupted out of the blue. This affords us the opportunity to see our host on his knees, noisily lamenting in front of the spilled bucket, in front of the puddle of expensive liquor which, with each passing moment, is spreading over the carpet.<br />
* * *<br />
We sit gloomily around the table, upon which the bucket is enthroned. In spite of the wholly tragic situation, my friend who had planned to kill himself today can no longer find the strength to reproach us with anything. He merely weeps, with his head in his hands. And we try to console him. Patting him on the back (the one with the orange braces). Or on the head (me).<br />
Using a piece of gauze, we have managed to collect a small part of the liquor spilled on the carpet. Which, added to that remaining in the bucket, makes, at present, one or perhaps two litres of whiskey standing on the table. We each have a cup of whiskey in front of us ; we are each trying to dissolve our bitterness by drinking from our cups. Undoubtedly, however, someone is less upset by the situation, and that someone, in spite of his guilt&#8209;ridden sighs, is my friend with the orange braces. In the end, he has got what he wanted. Now, without encountering any resistance on the part of our host, he can drink as much as he likes from the bucket of liquor.<br />
Nor is the atmosphere at all improved in the moment when the most afflicted among us, my pal, who has missed another opportunity to commit suicide, bursts into hysterical laughter. In fact, he even manages to scare us, when he thrusts away his chair with a shriek and climbs onto the table, and then starts to dance around the bucket. Such a reaction is anything but normal and so, seemingly of the same mind, we grab him by the legs and pull him back down.<br />
There is no way we can stop his laughter, however. Amid guffaws, he manages to say :<br />
&ldquo;And so there it is, brothers, ha, ha, starting tomorrow, instead of seeing to my own affairs in the other world, I&rsquo;ll be back to my staple trades : unemployment and bounty hunting ! Because there is no chance of me winning the lottery a second time !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Bounty hunting&rdquo; is merely the pompous term he uses to describe his work as an amateur dogcatcher or, to put it more accurately, as a man who scours the streets for days on end in search of pedigree dogs. Once he finds such a dog, my pal scans the newspapers for small ads that begin &ldquo;Pedigree dog lost in the &hellip; area.&rdquo; If a small ad includes information that fits the description of the dog he has found and, above all, if it concludes with &ldquo;Reward for the finder&rdquo;, he presents himself at the owner&rsquo;s door with the quadruped. If not, then the dog regains its freedom. More often than not, however, taking into account that not many dogs go missing from their owners at random, my pal helps them to go astray, without too many scruples.<br />
&ldquo;You said that you&rsquo;ve put some money aside for your funeral. You could spend it on another ten litres&hellip; So, there&rsquo;s still a chance of killing yourself,&rdquo; I encourage him.<br />
He looks at me as though I&rsquo;m from another planet, and stops laughing.<br />
&ldquo;And not be buried in the proper way ? Are you mad ? !&rdquo; he shouts at me. &ldquo;What do you want, for them to cremate me ?&rdquo;<br />
From the way he is looking at me, I probably ought to realise that the idea is utterly idiotic. But, I don&rsquo;t know why, it seems to me that there is not much difference between being buried and being cremated, given that, in any case, the act in question occurs after you die. And so I naively express this opinion.<br />
&ldquo;Look here, it&rsquo;s obvious that you don&rsquo;t know anything,&rdquo; he attempts to enlighten me, lowering his voice. &ldquo;But I, in contrast to you, still read a few things. I&rsquo;ve read that, if you burn, in the instant that your body reaches the temperature of a living person, you come back to life for a second. Get it ?&rdquo;<br />
This time it&rsquo;s my turn to look at him as though he were from another planet. But he doesn&rsquo;t give me very long to philosophise in the margins of this idea because, raising his voice, he says :<br />
&ldquo;What use to me is another second of life ? ! Go on, tell me, what use is it to me ? !&rdquo;<br />
Naturally, he doesn&rsquo;t have any use for that one second. So, without commenting further, I pick up my teacup of whiskey and knock it back. In complete silence, the other two follow my example.</p>

It is the immediate experience of a citizen at home in the Soviet milieu, on the one hand, combined with a literary, culturallyâacquired experience, on the other. They jointly define me as a product made in the USSR. It is virtually impossible for me to distinguish between the two. My narrative perspective, however, is that of Homo sovieticus, an undeniable product of that land and its culture. I therefore propose to avoid making any direct use of the intellectual paraphernalia I have since acquired.<br />
I am going to attempt a sort of archaeological approach to daily life in the former Soviet Union, with the object of arriving at a metaphor for Soviet culture and civilisation. The ensuing text, bearing the unavoidable marks of a &ldquo;heretical genre&rdquo;, aims at a puzzleâlike synthesis of topics, heroes, situations, memories, objects and key words. Although each piece of the resulting textâpuzzle can be read separately, the whole can only be perceived by methodically assembling the jigsaw. The resulting construct makes no claim to being an exact replica of Soviet culture as we knew it, in terms of objectivity and accuracy. Rather it is an exercise in subjective, personal archaeology, primarily concerned with tracing the contours of a culture, with capturing its overall &ldquo;mood&rdquo;, so to speak, its recurrent thoughtâ and speechâpatterns, in short, with sketching the Soviet cultural mentality. This archaeological exercise neither offers a key intended to foster understanding, nor does it pass moral or value judgments. It is simply intended to induce a familiarisation of sorts, with a view to helping each and every one of us to comprehend what the Soviet Union actually was, and &ndash; more to the point &ndash; what its absence actually means.<br />
Recounting the daily life of past times automatically poses all the risks associated with nostalgia &ndash; there is no doubt about that. Yet nostalgia as a concept clashes with the very idea of Homo sovieticus for the simple reason that nostalgia is a form of pastâoriented utopia, whereas he operates with futureâoriented utopias. Moreover, nostalgia as a form of homecoming is well nigh impossible since for us there is no such thing as home anymore. Thus, if there is any nostalgia to speak of, it is not of the kind that embarks upon a reconstruction of the past, but rather of the kind that resolves itself in the attempt to record memories from the past. As nostalgia, at least in theory, is not so unrelated to irony &ndash; both operate with the joint contemplation of the object and the subject &ndash; I take the liberty of combining the two, and thus look back with a mixture of nostalgia and irony.<br />
From time to time I feel the urge to book a ticket back to the USSR, and each time I have to remind myself such things are not on sale anymore. There is no train, no plane and no road that can take one back to the USSR, for the simple reason that the Soviet Union no longer exists. The only way for me to visit my country is by resorting to memory. The following text is the narrative reminiscence of that incredible adventure.</p> <p><i>What would the Soviet citizen drink ? (I)</i></p>
<p>There is a standard answer to this question: the Soviet citizen would drink anything, and lots of it too. For starters. The Soviet citizen would designate as drink any liquid possessing the capacity to contribute a shade of colour to daily life, or, more often than not, to reveal and enhance the hidden dispositions of the soul.<br />
To begin with, we perhaps ought to define the authentic drinker as such. Anyone can achieve a fair command of drinking, to a certain extent and for certain reasons, or simply in order to be admitted to a certain <i>tusovka/circle</i>. I can tell you in all honesty that the genuine drinker &ndash; and the Soviet drinker in particular &ndash; transcends such causes. We might say that, by and large, he is not even remotely affected by any of them. Any Soviet drinker worthy of the name drinks all by himself from early in the morning and needs no reason whatsoever to do so.<br />
The most familiar drinks in the USSR were vodka, wine, and beer, not to mention Troynoy Odekolon and the Chipok concoction. It is, of course, beyond the scope of our present study to furnish information on the actual drinking procedure. Nor are we here concerned with the amounts of the aforesaid substances ingested. Back home, traditional drinks were partaken of in lavish quantities and on a regular basis, just like out there, for that matter. The only difference had to do with the packaging and the wide selection on offer. It was the unofficial industry turning out a wide range of improvised drinks that truly boomed in &ldquo;the boundless land of my birth&rdquo;. The Soviet citizen took his fate in his own hands. Sensing that the state denied him a satisfactory range of alcoholic beverages, he decided to carve out a drinking destiny for himself. An initial alcoholic samizdat thus came into being. It was orally circulated and observed scrupulously to the letter. Building communism without alcohol is like practising capitalism without advertising. While advertising is the engine of the market economy in capitalism, the driving force of communism was drinking. It is noteworthy that the Soviet state used to provide its citizens with the raw materials required for the quick and inexpensive production of the most ingenious concoctions. Since the resulting variety was simply staggering, one is at a loss as to where to begin.<br />
Well then&hellip; Let&rsquo;s start with beer. Drinking beer just for the sake of drinking beer is a complete waste of time. With the rare exceptions of having it with friends over some tarakana (i.e. smoked salt fish ; on entering any beer place in the Soviet Union one could recognise the familiar odour of fish). Drinking beer in a variety of combinations is, on the other hand, a pursuit more instructive by far &ndash; the future appears much brighter, and one experiences a sensation akin to growing wings.<br />
Have you ever heard of Yorsh, one of the most popular drinks in the USSR ? Well, in the USSR mixing vodka into your beer is like adding salt to your soup. In the classic Yorsh, the ratio of 50g of vodka to 500g of beer is commonly observed. However, the proportions are known to fluctuate, depending on a variety of factors (climatic, psychosomatic, ideological etc.). Consequently, a combination based on a ratio of 250g to 250g is quite a frequent occurrence.<br />
For those interested in some of the finer points governing such admixtures, we have a number of more nuanced recipes. One of them is the Rembrandt (also known as Here Come the Thrushes) : the vodka is poured into the beer, taking precautions to avoid mixing the two. If the vodka settles neatly on the bottom and all mixing has been successfully avoided, we are in the presence of a genuine Rembrandt. If this isn&rsquo;t the case, then we&rsquo;re stuck with a forged Rembrandt. A proportion of 50g of vodka to 200g of beer characterises an early Rembrandt, while a proportion of 200g of vodka to 100g of beer is the hallmark of a late Rembrandt.<br />
Of further interest is the technique of Chasing the Bear into his Den. It is a simple enough technique : you take a pint of beer and drink it down in small gulps. The space vacated by each gulp is immediately replenished with vodka. The procedure is repeated until the initial amount of beer has been completely replaced with pure vodka. Chasing the Bear out of his Den is basically the same thing, the only difference being that beer has to replace the vodka. Another technique worth knowing about is Vodolaz. It involves the following steps : you drop a small glass of vodka into a pint of beer. The glass has to remain in an upright position. The pint is downed in one gulp, making sure the vodka is swallowed at the very end. In other words, as the Soviet saying goes, beer without vodka is like a wedding party without music. We should by all means mention here the Chipok. It is basically a Yorsh, that is, a mixture of vodka and beer, in which the pint is tightly covered with the palm of the hand prior to being vigorously knocked against the knee, with the aim of &ldquo;fizzing up&rdquo; the mixture. You don&rsquo;t want to know the effect&hellip;<br />

<i><b>In praise of the Soviet tualet</b></i><br />
<br />
<i>Dedicated to Ilya Kabakov</i><br />
<br />
There is hardly any space more conducive to intimacy in the life of the Soviet citizen than the tualet. (Allow me, as a token of my boundless respect for the convenience as such, as well as for the word designating it, to persist in employing the original Soviet term whenever referring to it in the present chapter : tualet.) It is, perhaps, the word that connotes the highest degree of intimacy in the vocabulary of any Soviet citizen. The tualet is where you alone and no one else but you go to solve those particular problems which no other person or agency can tackle in your stead. And I mean nobody &ndash; neither your father nor mother, neither your wife nor friend, not even the First Secretary himself can take your place in paying the mandatory visit you owe to the tualet. Your experience of the place is bound to mark you for life. The intimate relationship with the location and your perception thereof will be perpetuated in every nook and cranny of your inner self. Our individual awareness of the space in question went into the making of our national being. The Soviet tualet is part of an acquired commonwealth of experience, defining an essential trait of our spirit.<br />
I cannot approximate with any degree of accuracy the experience a citizen of a Western capitalist state may have in repairing to the convenience under discussion, yet on my very first visit to a country of that description, the first thing to cause me a nagging feeling of discomfort were the toilets. What made me uneasy was not their squalor, since compared to their opposite numbers in the Soviet Union they were a genuine paradise of cleanliness, nor was it any encroachment on privacy, since most of them were scrupulously partitioned to fend off the inquisitive looks of fellow patrons. I nonetheless resented their absolute inability to conjure up the state of intimacy I expected of such a place. For the Soviet citizen that is an unacceptable failure. The tualet ought to be the epitome of collective intimacy in its purest form. The Soviet citizen is afflicted with instant constipation when confronted with the capitalist boudoir that passes for a toilet, for the simple reason that such a space fails to elicit any intimate response from him. Consequently, there are no memories of western toilets one could dwell on. And the absence of memories signals the absence of intimacy.<br />
So what is so special about that particular place of perdition ? Well, I&rsquo;ll try to let you in on a few things, the sort of things not commonly shared with others, as each of us tends to keep them to ourselves. Intimate memories are hard to put into words. Such things are the stuff one holds onto in order to remember and enjoy privately. Few attempt to narrate them, and of those few, only a very small fraction are reasonably successful in the attempt. Nonetheless, let me give it a try.<br />
I ought to start by telling you that there are basically two types of Soviet tualet, which every Soviet citizen either loves or hates. All the same, regardless of the particular sentiment you entertain, you do relate intimately to both of them. The former type of tualet is the one in the komunal&rsquo;ka. This is where you first encounter it and also where you come to experience your first moments of intimacy with that kind of space. The komunal&rsquo;ka tualet is a space to be shared. It belongs equally to every one living in the house. That is to say, it is an area of shared intimacy, by no means limited to the intimate use of one&rsquo;s own family. It&rsquo;s where tyotya Klava also comes, as well as dyadya Volodya, just like the beautiful Marusya, and that pain in the neck Lyonya, as well as all the other twenty people living in the house. That place indiscriminately respects, services and puts up with each and every one of them. The tualet is essentially unbiased. One may occasionally hurt its feelings, yet it will never retaliate in kind.<br />
Going to any tualet is an art in itself, yet going to the one in the komunal&rsquo;ka should be counted among our most authentic rites of passage. This is where you become a sort of stalker/guide taking charge of your entire being. When going there you ought to know that, although you are alone, the neighbours are watching you. At any given time, there is bound to be at least one of them watching and passing judgement. &ldquo;There he goes again. Bound to spend another half an hour in there&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Reading novels, he is, or doing who knows what&rdquo;. Indeed, when you go to the tualet, if you the treat the place with the respect it deserves, there are two items that you should take along. Your book and your roll of toilet paper. Toilet paper is never to be found in the tualet proper. It belongs in your room, where it is given pride of place. And it is to be used sparingly. Yet you should not assume that, having forgotten to take your roll of toilet paper, you are bound to end up in an embarrassing situation. Not at all. You&rsquo;ll find in there, tucked in a nook, either a copy of last year&rsquo;s Pravda, which will automatically double as reading matter should you feel thus inclined, or a sheaf of convenientlyâsized sheets, neatly cut out of the Konsomol&rsquo;skaya Pravda by means of a pair of scissors. Tyotya Klava will see to it.<br />
As for the book, there are no restrictions whatsoever governing your choice of reading matter. It&rsquo;s entirely up to you. You have the freedom to read any book that might take your fancy. The tualet is the perfect reading room, as well as the place that ought to be credited with turning out the largest number of Soviet intellectuals, the most remarkable of them too. You should not succumb to the common misconception that our education is by and large the merit of the Soviet school, or of libraries such as &ldquo;Nadezhda Krupskaya&rdquo; or &ldquo;V.I. Lenin&rdquo;, or of some Lomonosov University or other. Granted, they did play a worthy part in our education. The tualet, however, beats by a long chalk any such educational and cultural establishments as far as our intellectual development is concerned. Therefore, whenever we express our gratitude towards the people and institutions that shape and educate us, we should not forget to give due thanks to this veritable sanctuary of Soviet culture &ndash; the tualet.<br />
The second important tualet in our lives, as well as in the great Soviet civilisation, is the public tualet. This is an altogether different space, a different world we might say, where existence acquires a dramatically new meaning. At this level, experience is more intense, more carnal, more biologically focused. This is where the tualet penetrates your being through every pore. While in the first case collective experience was only assumed, remote, cognitively implied, yet not palpably manifest, in this second case collective experience is overwhelmingly immediate.<br />
All over the country, from Kamchatka to Vilnius, from institutions such as schools to factories and plants, you will see whitewashed structures bearing on opposite corners, in large characters, the letters M and &AElig; (Men and Women, respectively). The classical design does away with doors, in favour of an Lâshaped wall sheltering the entrance and screening off the interior. Not that anyone would be even remotely curious to attempt viewing the interior in question. In the Soviet public tualet voyeurism is as good as nonâexistent. This is not a place where people watch each other. Watching is sooner avoided, even resisted. Everyone&rsquo;s eyes are on the lookout for the comfort provided by blind spots. In spite of all that, something strange happens. You start watching yourself through the eyes of others. You see yourself as seen by the others, you see yourself through their eyes, as it were. This is far more disturbing and gives way to a weird feeling you can&rsquo;t exactly put your finger on. <br />
On entering the premises, you had to act with great determination, walk briskly and watch your step. On occasions a certain degree of astuteness was required in order to accomplish the task you&rsquo;d taken upon yourself. Sometimes you&rsquo;d have to put it off, or even give it up altogether. You and the public tualet were pitted against each other in fierce combat, yet you had to respect it, for it was the place you couldn&rsquo;t imagine life without. And gradually, the combat, the odour, the tualet&rsquo;s very mode of existence came to be part of you.<br />
In there, running along a wall, there was a length of gutter, sloping down at an imperceptible gradient (in the Men&rsquo;s section, that is), into which water would be allowed to drip at very irregular intervals. If at all. That was the pissing area. On the opposite side there was a row of holes in the floor. I mean holes as in &ldquo;black hole&rdquo;. Each hole was flanked by soleâshaped footrests in high relief. Everything in plain view. The protruding soleâpatterned footrests were designed as an encouragement for you to take the &ldquo;eagle&rdquo; position over the pit and thus aim with optimum accuracy. Now I can&rsquo;t explain why, but the crux of the matter is that the Soviet citizen, although trained to aim accurately by the target practice routine to which he was subjected from his first years in school, would systematically fail to hit the pit at this particular location. The Soviet citizen&rsquo;s crap simply refused to enter the hole and vanish into the Void, into that great Nothingness. It demanded greater respect than that, it yearned to abide among us and tell us that it, too, existed, just as we existed. And, mysteriously, it was invariably successful in its endeavours. It stayed above, among us. Of course, there&rsquo;s no need for me to tell you that such decadent gimmicks as toilet paper were unheard of, and taps with running water were few and far between. One had to fight tooth and nail in order to survive the public tualet, and the theatre of combat was the tualet itself. You wanted to purge yourself of your excrement and cast the dregs of your being into the Void, but the excrement in question would put up a fight of incredible fierceness. The battle as such and the battlefield itself gradually came to be taken for granted. And if by reductio ad absurdum you found yourself in a tualet fitted with a pedestal (seat), then planting your feet on the pedestal was in the nature of things. The established matrix governing positions and hierarchies was not to be tampered with. <br />
This most intimate space of the Soviet being doubled as the archive of the most authentic messages transmitted by the Soviet citizen to the great Soviet people at large. They were the kind of messages whereby the unsophisticated citizen communicated with the whole world. The messages were inscribed upon the inner walls of the tualet, which had long since ceased to be white. They would be written using whatever happened to be available, from chalk to ballâpoint pen to faeces. As a rule, the messages dealt with fundamental topics, from love, e.g. &Igrave;&Agrave;&Oslash;&Agrave; + &Acirc;&Icirc;&Acirc;&Agrave; = &Euml;È&Aacute;&Icirc;&Acirc;&Uuml; (Masha + Vova = love), to the most exquisite forms of profanity. It is at the level of profanity that the Soviet people&rsquo;s innermost dispositions and highest aspirations find their truest expression. I would venture to say that in the Soviet Russian language there are a maximum of ten words and phrases synthetically expressing the Soviet personality and civilization in their entirety. Those words and phrases are not to be found in Lenin&rsquo;s Complete Works, neither in Marx&rsquo;s Capital, and still less in the syrupy writings of American Kremlinologists. They&rsquo;re to be found exclusively upon the walls of the tualet.<br />
I should like to add something else. You are, of course, familiar with Proust. What I want to tell you is that for the Soviet citizen nothing can play the part of Proust&rsquo;s madeleines more appropriately than the tualet. That is how the tualet functions for us. The familiar odour of faeces, urine and vast amounts of chlorine, sometimes bringing spontaneous tears to your eyes, the familiar sight of white walls streaked with piss, footprints and vulgar inscriptions, the familiar rush of chilly air piercing you in winter are liable, even today, to stir in the Soviet citizen the most sordid, yet most cherished, memories. It is the tualet that conjures up the most secret memories, thereby enabling you to revisit your own life.<br />

<i><b>From the</b></i><b> kukhnya <i>to the</i> ocheredi </b><br />
<br />
Coming from western countries, my friends, who are a highly educated and academically inclined lot, are quick to point out to me, by way of reproach, that we in the USSR were unable to construct a civil society. I stand rebuked. Indeed, we did fail to construct a civil society even remotely akin to western civil society, yet I very much doubt that we needed it in the first place, since Soviet society marched to a different beat, with altogether different mechanisms coming into play in the process. We had an altogether different set of social gatherings to serve as &ldquo;civil society&rdquo;, and I do assure you that in our daily life they were ideally suited for the part.<br />
The area primarily serving the purpose of bringing people together in clubâlike structures to foster social dialogue, political debate, analysis, attitude and &ndash; it goes without saying &ndash; heavy drinking, was the kukhnya/kitchen. (The relationship between communism and the kitchen is a reality which all communist countries seem to share.) In the beginning we would assemble in komunal&rsquo;ka kitchens. Subsequently the state provided us with apartments, each boasting its own separate kitchen. Why we needed kitchens in the first place was not for cooking, but for organising the aforesaid gatherings of Soviet &ldquo;civil society&rdquo;. The Party simply had to make such facilities available. We would get together, discuss, and immediately start drinking. The gathering as such was prompted by the rhetorical question commonly bandied about among friends : &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think drinking something might be the expedient thing to do under the circumstances ?&rdquo; And we would all agree that, indeed, it was the expedient thing to do, and we would file into the kitchen, and the discussion would flow just as &ldquo;immediately&rdquo;.<br />
Such gatherings were usually frequented by close friends, yet it was not uncommon for less familiar guests to join them. We took the liberty of discussing almost everything. We would discuss the position of our leaders with respect to foreign or domestic politics, and would even go so far as to question our intervention in Afghanistan. We would exchange information on who had managed to get hold of what books, what music they&rsquo;d been listening to or acquired, what was the evolution of Sakharov&rsquo;s condition, and what Radio Free Europe was saying. We would consider new methods for improving the system, and rather than raise ideological issues, we would object primarily to the State&rsquo;s inability to provide us with consumer goods. The State, in its way, would tolerate us, would listen, and would provide us with an amount of goods sufficient to keep ideologyârelated doubts within reasonable limits. In our hearts we all knew that we were ideologically superior to the classâenemy, and our standard bearers, Marx and Lenin, couldn&rsquo;t possibly be wrong. Granted, the Party did commit the odd faux pas, some of our leaders would make occasional mistakes, yet all this meant was that we could go back to the direction traced by the first revolutionaries. This point was also duly subjected to debate in the kitchen, the place where Soviet &ldquo;civil society&rdquo; was wont to gather. <br />
Things did not stop there, however. The State would provide us with a further opportunity for assembly, which the citizens of a capitalist country could never have imagined, namely the ocheredi/queue. Queuing was a mode of existence, a hypostasis of any communist entity, the ultimate communist awareness of being, we might say. Those lacking such awareness have no idea what life is all about. The Soviet people were not altogether devoid of Russian inclinations, and thus they would often come to discuss such metaphysical matters as &ldquo;Does God exist ?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is the meaning of life ?&rdquo; Various answers to those questions would be attempted in the kitchen. The vodka would flow, answers were quick to follow suit, and we would reach our conclusions. God, it was obvious, did not exist, since Soviet science had convincingly demonstrated His nonâexistence. As for life itself, it was even more obvious that man only lived once, for the purpose of queuing. Consequently we would go on queuing.<br />
What did people queue for ? Now, this is the wrong way of asking the question. You pose such questions in terms of Americans, since in principle they queue up during sales in order to consume things they do not actually need, but only believe they do. As far as the Soviet citizen is concerned, the question simply doesn&rsquo;t make sense. The queue was a datum, a privilege obtained in the process of class struggle, and therefore we queued. Far from being just a means to an end, the queue was, first and foremost, a raison d&rsquo;etre. In due time, quite naturally, you did come to find out what you&rsquo;d been queuing for &ndash; as it was not uncommon for people to join a queue in the hope of making some worthwhile purchase only to find out in the end that they had been queuing outside the city information bureau.<br />
There is such a thing as a genuine queue culture, including its own specialised vocabulary. For all their liberty and all their civil society they were unable to create the kind of affluence brought about by this our social institution. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the person after you ?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you the last one in the queue ?&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you be so kind as to keep my place for me in the queue ?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a moment&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey, young man, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are they selling here ?&rdquo; And so on and so forth. At this point, I do not propose to explain the wealth of meaning implied by such utterances. Those who know are not ignorant of the matter, and those who do not will never find out. I could list countless phrases and situations which are truly remarkable. This is where new acquaintances were made, ideas and opinions took shape, group solidarity either came into existence or came to nothing. This is where I witnessed the power of the proletariat as well as its anger. This is where I learned what &ldquo;being of one accord&rdquo; and &ldquo;together for better and worse&rdquo; really meant. However, this is also where I witnessed the rage and triumph of the individualist spirit in action. This is where I learned the meaning of class conscience &ndash; the class conscience of the queue. It is a force capable of changing the world from its very foundations. The more is the pity that those capitalists managed to manufacture goods in such quantities as to exceed our capacity to queue. Mass production dealt a fatal blow to queue production, and in the process, we were transformed from superiorâconscience proletarians into pathetic consumers. The dictatorship of massâproduced goods was stronger than the dictatorship of the queue. And thus, Soviet civil society relinquished their positions in order to watch the commercial break on television.</p>

There is no train, no plane and no road that can take one back to the USSR, for the simple reason that the Soviet Union no longer exists. The only way for me to visit my country is by resorting to memory. The following text is the narrative reminiscence of that incredible adventure.</p> 2007 Born in USSR Nascut in URSS
11 Theodosius the Small Theodosie cel Mic Novel "Ego Prose" series, Polirom, 2006, 440 pages Polirom All rights available <p>Razvan Radulescu&rsquo;s novel <i>Theodosius the Small,</i> a fantasy that garbs social concerns in fairytale attire, concocts characters that would by no means be out of place sitting at the same table as today&rsquo;s politicians, strategists or media personalities. The author &ldquo;profits&rdquo; from subjects and characters whose equivalent can be found in reality, filters them through his own sense of the absurd, creates exuberant identities for them and, on no few occasions, allows them, with ludic sadism, to kill each other, to lay traps for each other, and to reveal their grotesque face.<br />
In the world of Razvan Radulescu, the geography of Romania is transformed : borders are jumbled in such a way that conflicts with historic roots are sparked in the resulting new territories. Within a fantastic Wallachia, we find miniature kingdoms, containing both familiar contemporary localities, such as Bucharest, Filia&#351;i and Petrila, and places established by narrative convention, such as the Mushroom Fields, Strawberry Fields, and Mushberry Valley. Of course, since conflicts in such important and interesting fictional regions require characters to match, the &ldquo;potentates of the day&rdquo; find their way in to the story : the masters who fight for a share of zones of influence and power. Thus we have Theodosius the Small, Gavriil the Catdog, Kalliope the Owl, Samoil the Minotaur, Otilia the Ghost, and Oliviu the Sheatfish Protector, allied with Duke Otto and the Purple Ants. These are characters who are specific to the fantasy and at the same time somehow affable, but who conceal towering ambitions and Machiavellian minds. In the kingdom inherited by Theodosius, too young to hold the reins of power, plots are hatched, intrigues develop, and spectacular battles are waged.<br />
The backdrop appears to be historical &ndash; there are conflicts between palaces, kings sit on thrones, wars are waged by the sword, we witness banquets typical of times long passed, and communication is by means of courier &ndash; but nevertheless the story also has many elements from the contemporary world. And the interventions of the author, who assumes the task of explaining certain controversial aspects of the book, situate it within a fully postmodern context. These interventions on the part of the narrator, sometimes even taking the form of letters addressed to the imagined editor of his &ldquo;chronicle&rdquo;, although written in a harsh and sententious tone, are more often than not riotously funny, counterbalancing the bloody events of the story and providing welcome respite for the reader.<br />
In the end, the novel is a story about childhood, seen through adult eyes. However, it is not about childhood in itself, but rather about its fantasies, about the way in which the events of today&rsquo;s world are transformed by the vision of a child into fantastic madness, with comic horrors and sad comedies. A novel about childhood, but one whose message is aimed above all at adults.</p> <p>In spite of the sumptuous preparations the Catdog and Theodosius had made for the Sheatfish Protector&rsquo;s reception (the entire residence had been inundated in water, the pillows from the couch and the napkins in the kitchen were slowly spinning in the blue eddies, and the rugs had risen ten or even twenty centimetres aloft and were fluttering in slow motion), the latter, whether from excessive caution or because he wanted to be entertained in a less customary fashion, had arrived in his own travel aquarium and requested that the banquet be held in the shade of the walnut tree.<br />
The Catdog had punctiliously complied, and assisted by Theodosius he had brought out a long table.<br />
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for any chairs,&rdquo; the Sheatfish Protector gestured behind the glass of his spacious aquarium in token of refusal. Indeed, through the none too limpid water of the aquarium &ndash; lake water, as Theodosius imagined &ndash; it was possible to see a little table with curved legs, on which stood three dishes all in a row (one deeper, for the soup, another shallow, for the main course, and the last smaller, for dessert) ; an ice bucket on a stand, and a separate compartment for ice cubes ; and an armchair, in which the Sheatfish Protector was lolling. The armchair was quite similar to the one Theodosius had seen at the bottom of Cold Lake, but was probably lighter. In addition, the aquarium of the Sheatfish contained a plain serving table, lake sand and silt &ndash; which eddied up from the bottom whenever the Sheatfish shifted position on his throne &ndash; two pots with filiform freshwater plants, and a complicated device, consisting mainly of an articulated tube, a funnel, and numerous rubber grommets, which allowed the fish to make himself heard when he deigned to speak. Around the panes of the aquarium, fastened by cords, it was possible to draw rich drapes, whose folds were now crammed into the corners. The entire glass construction and all its contents rested on a metal stand, from which two sturdy and skilfully decorated handles protruded to either side. The aquarium could be lifted and carried from place to place by means of these handles. For this none too pleasant task (since the aquarium, with the Shearfish in it, must have been rather heavy), the fat fish was accompanied, besides another six fishes of lesser rank, by four bearer fishes, themselves encased in their own aquaria. Of course, the aquaria that ensured a natural medium for those who transported the Sheatfish Protector were less sumptuous and had no facilities whatsoever : there were neither tables nor chairs nor ice buckets (in any case, during the entire course of the subsequent banquet, nothing was to pass the lips of the bearer fish). Their aquaria sooner resembled glass suits of armour, through which their arms and legs protruded into the air, strangulated by joints with rubber garnitures and riveted rings. The construction of the aquaria in effect prevented the fish from sitting, and when the Catdog made a gesture for them to be seated, the four bearers angrily jerked their legs, emitting from their mouths remarks that materialised in streams of bubbles and gathered on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you have to drink ?&rdquo; the Catdog asked the Sheatfish Protector.<br />
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we have to drink ?&rdquo; The Sheatfish turned toward his six counsellors, who, installed upon their sub&#8209;aquatic chairs, were each unfolding a serviette and leisurely spreading them over their knees. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we having anything to drink ? Very well. I&rsquo;ll have wine.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have wine too,&rdquo; said Theodosius, sitting on the other side of the table, opposite the Sheatfish Protector.<br />
The Catdog poured about two fingers of wine into his glass, filled his own cup to the brim, and poured the contents of a third over the upper lip of the aquarium, into the water containing the Sheatfish. The wine separated into thick strands and sank undulating like an octopus over the fish. The latter opened his mouth and engulfed a part of the liquid.<br />
&ldquo;Cheers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;re in the mood for toasts, make them yourselves.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I should like to make a toast,&rdquo; could be heard from the voice funnel of one of the counsellors. &ldquo;Though I have no wine,&rdquo; he said, affably rising from his chair, &ldquo;I would like to wish the Illustrious Theodosius a long reign and to assure him that, although in the past perhaps we fishes have machinated against him, the whole of Cold Lake is now loyal to him unto the death &ndash; or at least so I believe.&rdquo;<br />
The Sheatfish&rsquo;s face darkened and he drummed his fingers on the tabletop.<br />
&ldquo;Have you finished ?&rdquo; he asked the counsellor.<br />
&ldquo;Straight away, illustrious Sheatfish Protector. I should merely like to add that yesterday, following the departure of the illustrious Catdog, we signed a treaty with the Purple Ants as regards exploitation of the Petrila salt mines. And with the Green Ants, in Filia&#351;i, we had a fruitful meeting&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; the Catdog interrupted him, let us go back a little to Petrila. When&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Why should we go back to Petrila ?&rdquo; mewed the Sheatfish Protector in the Catdog&rsquo;s direction, and then twisted around toward the counsellor and glared at him. &ldquo;We are here to carouse, not to talk politics. All the more so given that I have ascertained that politics poisons our lives.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Agreed, let&rsquo;s not talk politics,&rdquo; said the Catdog. &ldquo;I merely want to find out what is with the salt mines.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I shall explain,&rdquo; said the Sheatfish benevolently. &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he addressed the counsellor. &ldquo;And jettison the acoustic tube. Now. Jettison the tube. And you, all of you, jettison your tubes. Please don&rsquo;t think badly of me,&rdquo; he went on, turning toward Theodosius and the Catdog, &ldquo;but I can no longer abide these counsellors when they open their mouths. They are very duplicitous. I ask them something and they start to quibble, about how you are our master, illustrious Sheatfish Protector, and so on. I can never get a sincere opinion from my subjects. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m leaving them without their funnels, because then they have to give a straight answer : to nod either yes or no.&rdquo;<br />
Indeed, the fish&#8209;counsellors had jettisoned their funnel&shy;&#8209;equipped tubes &ndash; they had fallen with a thud onto the grass &ndash; and were now looking at their master with ineffable sadness.<br />
&ldquo;What have you got to say, you gang of scoundrels,&rdquo; the Sheatfish bellowed at them, causing the water at the surface of his aquarium to ripple. &ldquo;Do any of you still want to make a toast ?&rdquo;<br />
The fish shook their heads.<br />
&ldquo;I repeat the question : do any of you still want to make a toast ?&rdquo;<br />
Anxious, the counsellors consulted among themselves by means of glances and then, doubtfully, nodded their heads.<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fool with me,&rdquo; roared the Sheatfish, and the six began to quiver like reeds, moving their heads in every direction. The Sheatfish looked at them piercingly, then slumped in his armchair and began to laugh. &ldquo;Good, we&rsquo;ve cleared that one up. I&rsquo;ll have a piece of ham, if you&rsquo;ll be so kind, Gavriil. I&rsquo;d like you to remove the parsley from on top &ndash; it gets stuck in my throat. I&rsquo;d like you to serve me, Theodosius.&rdquo;<br />
Theodosius gave a start. The wine had somewhat gone to his head and he had been overwhelmed by sweet boredom. He rose from his seat, took a slice of ham, brushing off the parsley, and cast it into the Sheatfish Protector&rsquo;s aquarium. The latter watched it gently sinking, alternately casting glances at Theodosius, visibly dissatisfied at the way he had tossed him the morsel, and then, as the ham reached the level of his nose, he gulped it down, closing his eyes. <br />
&ldquo;Tell me what is with Petrila,&rdquo; the Catdog resumed.<br />
&ldquo;With Petrila,&rdquo; answered the Sheatfish Protector with his mouth full, &ldquo;things stand thus : immediately after our discussion yesterday, I decided to put to some kind of use the privileges you are prepared to grant the ants in future, and to implement a costly investment. That of giving my subjects a salt water resort in the Whale Gulf, with facilities, the whole works.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You move fast,&rdquo; said the Catdog, biting his lower lip.<br />
&ldquo;Why not ? The costs of the investment are high. If we&rsquo;d come to an understanding after you signed the treaty, the ants would have increased their pretensions. You can&rsquo;t condemn me for my business acumen. The main thing is to be on the ball.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Why is it called the Whale Gulf ?&rdquo; Theodosius demanded to know, while in his mind there took shape a gleaming cetacean, which frolicked in the gulf spurting jets of water from the top of its head.<br />
&ldquo;Ah, because the lake is so salty in that area that only a whale could live there.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh, really ?&rdquo; wondered the Catdog. &ldquo;I had always thought it was because it has the shape of a whale when you look at it on the map.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Pah, not at all,&rdquo; laughed the Sheatfish. &ldquo;You spend too much time looking at maps. Where&rsquo;s the shape of a whale ? What&rsquo;s the shape of a whale ? I&rsquo;d like some more ham and, if possible, some cheese. I too would have the shape of a whale if you drew me on a map. No, the water is salty because of the Saltwater River. Which river, pay attention here, Theodosius, you&rsquo;ll laugh, is only salty in fact after it passes through the salt mines. That is what makes the ants believe they have rights over the water in Whale Gulf. They claim that the salt is theirs. Some more wine, please.&rdquo;<br />
The Catdog rose and poured wine into the fish&rsquo;s aquarium. In doing so, he noticed that the six counsellors were squirming in their chairs and pointing at their mouths.<br />
&ldquo;Are you hungry ?&rdquo; asked Gavriil the Catdog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fishes nodded repeatedly. Theodosius took some trays of appetisers from the table and, with the aid of a fork, emptied the food into the aquaria, taking care to share it out as fairly as possible. The counsellors fell to eating at once, with tears of gratitude streaming from their eyes.<br />
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued the Sheatfish. &ldquo;The question of desalinisation of the river came up a few years ago. I was against it. A part of the authorities at Petrila is in favour of closing the salt mines. That, you will realise, would automatically transform the Saltwater River into a freshwater river.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And how will they make a living if they close the mines ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s their business. As it seems to me, that is not the issue. It&rsquo;s a question of principles : the Gulf stream carries the salt across the lake almost to the other shore. Not much salt, it&rsquo;s true, but a certain amount. Tell me, in strictly legal terms, whose is the salt carried by the Gulf stream ? The ants&rsquo; ? So don&rsquo;t be surprised if they lay claim to that as well, tomorrow or the day after.&rdquo;<br />
The Catdog had relaxed and began to laugh.<br />
&ldquo;You do what you do and in the end the treaty with the ants still does not suit you. It is plain from every word you say.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it ?&rdquo; said the fish with his mouth full.<br />
&ldquo;Aha.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Aha, you say, but it doesn&rsquo;t suit me at all. That is, if they close the mines, it&rsquo;s one thing : I couldn&rsquo;t care less, that&rsquo;ll be the end of my resort, but that&rsquo;s how it goes. I&rsquo;m not going to do myself in because of it. But there will probably start to be an exodus of the unemployed to Filia&#351;i. The implications of commuting are dreadful. Think of the traffic of ants over the lake from dawn to dusk. It&rsquo;s clear to you that they&rsquo;ll be commuting over the lake day in day out.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And then ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And then my delegation negotiated with that part of the leadership which doesn&rsquo;t want to close the mines. Simple. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe it, but you find a lot of Purple Ants who despise the Green Ants from the west and who want to split the province. Personally, I don&rsquo;t understand them, for me all ants are the same, blonde or brunette, it&rsquo;s all the same to me, I find them all repulsive alike and I detest them all alike, with those muscles of their like balls and those antennae waving all the time. Ugh, they make you want to puke.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; the Catdog gestured, &ldquo;we are eating.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the Sheatfish, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. I only wanted to give you an idea so that you can understand what I feel at the thought of boatloads of such creatures sailing up and down my lake. However, to resume. I sent a team of negotiators. And they negotiated and I signed a treaty stipulating that the mines will remain open, and I think that in a year or two the Whale Gulf will become a paradise of underwater resorts.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said the Catdog. &ldquo;That is, I understand partly. You say you negotiated. I am convinced that the ants who backed your cause received certain bonuses on your part.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; the Sheatfish Protector agreed, leaning back and extracting a toothpick from the pocket of his caftan.<br />
&ldquo;I would be curious to know what.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Ah, a mere bagatelle. I promised them I would organise wee adventures for their political opponents whenever they try to cross the lake.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And will you organise them ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask, I haven&rsquo;t got a clue about technical details of that kind. I signed an agreement of principle. It&rsquo;s possible that you will hear or read in the papers that such and such a vessel bound for Filia&#351;i suddenly sprang a leak and that the crew were forced to abandon ship and so on and so forth, but I repeat, I won&rsquo;t have any concrete cases on my conscience.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And did you promise them anything else ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I promised them effective support so that the government favourable to me will remain in power and rule the Green Ants henceforth for long and happy years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Catdog could not have been more amused. The Sheatfish Protector too began to smile.<br />
&ldquo;Do you know what amazes me ?&rdquo; asked the Catdog. &ldquo;It amazes me that you never pose the problem that an unfortunate accident might also befall you, and then all the strings you have been pulling, all your arrangements and all your calculations will blow up. I have been wondering for a long time whether you are a politician or an intriguer and now I think it is starting to become clear to me.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Gavriil, you can think what you like about me. However, I assure you that, behind every move I make there stands the good of the kingdom.&rdquo; The Sheatfish had solemnly placed his right hand on his chest. &ldquo;What I am doing may seem a nasty trick, but I, in my own inner forum, know that I am inspired by the best intentions and one day you too will convince yourselves of this truth. It may be that when you convince yourselves, I shall no longer be,&rdquo; added the Sheatfish Protector, after a tear&#8209;jerking pause.<br />
&ldquo;What can I say,&rdquo; the Catdog admitted defeat. &ldquo;Faced with such statements I can do no more than to raise my glass and drink your health. Theodosius, let us drink to the health of the Sheatfish Protector and the Cold Lake, which, even if he does not rule it wisely, he rules driven by the best intentions.<br />
Having said that, Gavriil emptied his cup and put it on the table. Theodosius drank too and felt that he was becoming sleepy. The Catdog leaned toward his ear and said to him in a hushed voice :<br />
&ldquo;I know you are bored, but I promise you that as soon as the party is over I shall take you to the &lsquo;Little Lemon&rsquo; caf&eacute; and buy you two chocolate cakes, an &eacute;clair and a baklava.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What, does the &lsquo;Little Lemon&rsquo; still exist ?&rdquo; asked the Sheatfish, to keep the conversation going.<br />
&ldquo;Of course it does,&rdquo; affirmed the Catdog.<br />
&ldquo;Hmm, I thought they had closed it down. Do you recall, we used to go to that restaurant opposite, also on the boulevard, what was it called&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;The &lsquo;Little Cherry&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;The &lsquo;Little Cherry&rsquo;, we used to eat steaks, drink until we were blotto and then go off to the &lsquo;Little Lemon&rsquo;, where there was a brothel.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Theodosius, you go off to bed now, sleep for a couple of hours, and after that we&rsquo;ll go to the caf&eacute;.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Leave him be, Gavriil, don&rsquo;t send him off. He ought to know too, that that was what they used to say, that it was a brothel.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way you could have known. It was only a rumour and, whenever you wanted to check, it would turn out that you were blotto, as you yourself say,&rdquo; the Catdog put him in his place.<br />
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely the charm of it,&rdquo; said the Sheatfish, whose speech had become slurred. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the charm of it. To hear a rumour and not to verify it and to behave as though it were true. That&rsquo;s the only way you can maintain order. I&rsquo;m telling it only so that, just like that, so that you know.&rdquo; The Sheatfish&rsquo;s tone became confidential. &ldquo;If I allowed myself to ignore or to throw into doubt a single rumour from all those that pass my ears, I would long ago have been a gleaming skeleton at the bottom of the lake. Is that or is that not so, conclave of plotters ?&rdquo; roared the Sheatfish unexpectedly, turning on his counsellors. The latter dropped the forks from their hands and began to tremble once more ; while two of them nodded affirmatively, the other four shook their heads in negation.<br />
&ldquo;Leave them in peace,&rdquo; said the Catdog in disgust. &ldquo;Let us drink instead.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink, by all means, but let&rsquo;s make merry too and pleasurably recall our youth,&rdquo; said the Sheatfish with misty eyes, and then went on to address Theodosius alone. &ldquo;You should know, my beloved child, that at the &lsquo;Little Lemon&rsquo; caf&eacute; there was a brothel on the first floor, and you used to go in through the caf&eacute;. But they didn&rsquo;t let you go in just like that, any old how. Because it was only for customers of the house, those with an open palm, who used to go in innocently, walk up and down in front of the counters with cream puffs, &eacute;clairs, nougat, iced buns, fudge cake, tarts, &eacute;clairs &ndash; I&rsquo;ve already said &ndash; and with an air that they were itching to buy, they would ask the fat woman vendor (what was she called, Gavriil ? Geta ?) with the moustache and headscarf, they would ask her if by any chance, besides all the goodies on display in the refrigerated display cabinet, she had any home&#8209;made chocolate cake with cherries. Or with morellos, I forget which, because I&rsquo;m old and as drunk as a hog (pour some more wine Gavriil). And then the vendor would make a hidden sign with her hand and the customer would vanish through the curtain towards the kitchen. And there, at the stainless steel tables, splattered with pastry dough, whipped cream and icing sugar, young lasses, in the fifth or sixth form at the most, summarily dressed, would be twirling rolling pins, touching the table with their tummies.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a libidinous hog,&rdquo; Gavriil the Catdog upbraided him, without much conviction, even smiling at the shadows of the past that were flitting through his mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sheatfish grinned and he too closed his eyes.<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m old, but I&rsquo;m still in form,&rdquo; he articulated with difficulty and asked for another glass of wine. &ldquo;I could have looked after Theodosius. You have no idea, my boy, what you are missing, and that&rsquo;s without taking into account that, living with me, you would have grown a lovely pair of gills on the nape of your neck and you would have been able to breathe underwater just as easily as us.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Or we could have lived here, in this house, and you would have grown a pair of lungs,&rdquo; retorted Theodosius unexpectedly.<br />
The Sheatfish gave a start, unpleasantly surprised.<br />
&ldquo;Look at him, Gavriil, what a cheeky little whippersnapper. And you&rsquo;re laughing too. Laugh and you&rsquo;ll only encourage him to speak to me in that tone. If I&rsquo;d brought up him in the way I know best, he would have been a respectful young lad by now, without any nasty habits, he would have been obedient, Gavriil. And he would have ruled the kingdom wisely. First of all as regent &ndash; and I, his trusty tutor, would have guided him with my advice &ndash; then as king when he came of age &ndash; and again I, his humble counsellor, would have whispered in his ear my opinions founded on experience. He would have learned to treasure me, Gavriil, and see here, at this age he would have been ruling the kingdom without a care. But as it is, what a tangled situation ! His throne &ndash; Otto wants it ; his authority is the same as when you break a dish but not completely : cracked. The ants dream of an autonomous state and I swear to you, Gavriil, they will have it. By force of circumstances they will have it, and I am going to do all in my power, before you manage to sign any expanded treaty, I&rsquo;m no ox to force things, but I, I,&rdquo; screamed the Sheatfish without warning, banging the table and knocking the plates out of alignment, &ldquo;instead of having a carefree old age, I have to wrack my brains, to sign secret agreements, and to obtain by subterfuge and tactical conjuring tricks what I deserve by rights. Two teardrops quivered in the scaly eyelids of the Sheatfish, as though in a Japanese cartoon. &ldquo;I have betrayed you, Gavriil, I have betrayed my sovereign, but for his own good. I don&rsquo;t care about you. Do you know how much I care ? This much. In the end I&rsquo;m glad that you have dealt with bringing him up, so that everyone can see what a predicament the kingdom has fallen into : disorder, disintegration, tabloid scandals. You&rsquo;ve lost your grip on the reins, you don&rsquo;t even care about them, what have you been up to all these years ? You&rsquo;ve gone fishing, you&rsquo;ve cleared the forests from the royal estates &ndash; any servant could have done that, but you don&rsquo;t have servants. You&rsquo;ve taught Theodosius how to live on a modest income, like a servant. You&rsquo;ve wasted your time trying to reconcile Kalliope and Samoil, two senile oldsters I would have done away with quicker than you can say fish. When I come to power &ndash; oh, how I&rsquo;ll laugh then, because perhaps you imagine that moment is a very long way off, but I&rsquo;m telling you it&rsquo;s very close &ndash; when I come to power, those old bastards will hang as quick as can be, from two nice little gibbets. And as for you &ndash; you time&#8209;waster &ndash; I&rsquo;ll throw you in the dungeon at Filia&#351;i. You know, I go there at least once a week and, whenever I have time, and twice a week I go to the eastern shore of the lake to see the thick mossy walls of the gaol reflected in the water. And as for Theodosius, I&rsquo;ll leave it up to him to choose whether he wants to be handed over to Otto, who keeps insistently demanding him (oh, how insistently he demands him !) or to remain king and obey me. In the end, how much do I ask ? Am I asking much ? How many years do I have left to live ? Understand me, Gavriil, in the years still left to me, I want to rule the kingdom, from the shadow. I don&rsquo;t want Bucharest to be full of statues to the Sheatfish Protector. I don&rsquo;t want my name in all the school history textbooks &ndash; that&rsquo;s just a consolation for the vainglorious. All I want is to rule. To expand the waters of the lake. And for Bucharest to be submerged, so that I can, thank you very much, stroll over the bottom of a big lake as far as Mushberry Valley, which will be called the Duckweed Shore, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking of calling it, and north as far as the foothills of Ottoberg Castle, and east as far as Our Sea, for that is our wish, by the will of the Great Sheatfish Protector over the Cold and Salt Lake, stretching over the capital and over the Apple Orchards, which apple trees, under water, will bring to light rotten fruit.&rdquo;<br />
The Sheatfish swallowed the saliva at the corners of his mouth and rolled his gaze over those present : three of the six counsellors were casting uneasy glances, another two were stock&#8209;still and seemed no longer to be breathing ; the last kept opening his mouth spasmodically and releasing, at regular intervals, a bubble of air. Gavriil had sat with his fists propping up his chin during the Sheatfish&rsquo;s peroration and now he was slowly recovering from his astonishment. Theodosius had grown frightened and was avoiding the fish&rsquo;s eyes. He was clinging to the Catdog&rsquo;s waistcoat with all his might. The Catdog bent down and whispered in his ear :<br />
&ldquo;Let him be, he&rsquo;s talking nonsense.&rdquo; Then he added, &ldquo;He not such a bad lad as he seems. But when he drinks too much, he says stupid things. You know,&rdquo; he addressed the Sheatfish Protector, who, with his eyes transfixed in space, had remained prey to his own enthusiasm, &ldquo;for those words I could throw you into gaol, not tomorrow, when perhaps you will be in power, but now, when I am. Or I could, legally, pull the plug out of your tank and let you suffocate slowly. Do you know that ?&rdquo;<br />
The Sheatfish smacked his lips with the indifference of a drunkard and, manoeuvring a lever under his table, caused the curtains that adorned the inside of the aquarium to unfurl along their cords and completely cover the windowpanes. In a short while a loud snoring could be heard from behind the drapes.</p>

12 The Encounter Intalnirea novel "Fiction Ltd" series, Polirom, 2007 (2nd revised edition),  320 pages, 130x200 mm Polirom Palamart (Hungary), Panorama (Bulgaria), Edizioni Nottetempo (Italy) <p>Harassed by train conductors who demand his ticket in several languages, a middle&#8209;aged man endures a nightmare of hiding and flight, before managing to cross a frontier guarded by soldiers and dogs. He has returned to his native village. There he finds his whole family gathered around a big table, as though for a wedding, baptism or wake, but no one recognises him, not even his mother. The relatives take him for a lunatic on the run from an asylum, or for a Securitate informer, and chase him away. <br />
Traian Manu, a renowned scientist in Italy, wakes up from this typical dream of exile in a car driven by his wife on the highway between Naples and Rome. In spite of his wife Christa&rsquo;s opposition, Manu has agreed to visit his native country of Romania, at the insistence of a former colleague, Alexandru Stan, in spite of not having had any ties with the country since it became a Communist state. It is August 1986. Romania is still a Communist country, ruled by Nicolae Ceau&#351;escu.<br />
Of German origin, Christa understands Manu&rsquo;s nostalgia but warns him of the dangers lurking in any totalitarian regime. To persuade him, she tells him stories from her own childhood and adolescence during the Nazi dictatorship, about growing up with the feeling of being permanently watched, about the humiliation of being part of a collective that glorifies a dictator, and about how she lost her family members one by one.<br />
Manu&rsquo;s trip to Romania is in fact the brainchild of collaboration between Alexandru Stan, a Romanian official, and the Securitate. The aim is for the communist regime to take advantage of Manu&rsquo;s relations in the West. Manu is followed everywhere, his every move is recorded on tape and in reports by the spy team, which finally (and paradoxically) succeeds in making Manu trust only those people who are actually Securitate agents&mdash;to the exclusion of all the innocent people who had been waiting for him in good faith. All this evolves into a perverse plan to enlist the innocents as informers via a blackmail scheme. Among the innocents is Manu&rsquo;s nephew, Daniel, who vainly hopes to be recognised as his uncle&rsquo;s younger alter ego&mdash;a character important to the story on account of his incisive point of view.<br />
The Securitate&rsquo;s plan falls apart at the very moment when there is nothing left to oppose them. Safely back in his adopted country, exhausted by the trip and wracked by conflicting emotions, Manu suffers a heart attack in the car as his wife drives him home.</p> <p>Don&rsquo;t you hear &ndash; how the door of the next compartment has just opened? It must be a ticket collector. Who else raps the words out like that? Everything so clear and distinct :<br />
&ldquo;Gutten Tag, geben Sie mir bitte!&rdquo;<br />
Feverish, tense, you try to calm your rapid breathing. Your glance fastens sideways on the dark, shining window. Except that you can&rsquo;t see the landscapes coursing into the night. You&rsquo;re in an express, an intercity.<br />
&ldquo;Den Fahrschein Bitte!&rdquo;<br />
You pat your pockets as though you wanted to go out into the corridor to smoke. The people in the compartment keep their eyes trained &ndash; on you. Are they looking? Aren&rsquo;t they? <br />
&ldquo;Bonjour, mesdames, messieurs! Vos billets, s&rsquo;il vous plait!&rdquo;<br />
Rising slowly from the bench, you glimpse your petrified face; it flashes in the emptiness of a mirror. Is it your face? It seems not.<br />
&ldquo;Your ticket please!&rdquo;<br />
You squeeze past overcoats, suit jackets, hats; past shoes &ndash; look! as shiny as the moon &ndash; that you try not to tread on; you try hard; you ooze along the corridor; your shadow slides past motionless faces behind compartment windows &ndash; rhythmically slides &ndash; and you hope those motionless&hellip; are convinced you&rsquo;re going to the restaurant, the buffet, the toilet, quickly, quicker, even quicker, quicker still, yet&hellip;<br />
&ldquo;Den Fahrschein Bitte!&rdquo;<br />
The speed of the train buffets you against the walls; you&rsquo;re in an express, a train de grande vitesse. Tgv. You are in the Dr&#259;g&#259;&#351;ani train, third class &ndash; puffy black curls : they clog your throat, and a bee buzzes around for a long time. But look, two steps away, the railway clerk&rsquo;s uniform, the conductor&rsquo;s cap, his hand held out to punch you ticket.<br />
&ldquo;Good morning, sir! Your ticket, please!&rdquo;<br />
Now a trapdoor will open beneath your feet and still explaining, shame&#8209;faced, sweaty, jumbled among pronunciations, declensions, conjugations, you&rsquo;ll summersault between the rapidly turning wheels until you hit wet darkness.<br />
How lucky : the conductor didn&rsquo;t notice you when he was two steps away! Luckier still, no one sees you struggling under the mound of clothes, heavy overcoats, uniforms, smoking jackets, rustling trench coats, white sheets, the shroud from which rises a cloud of moths. No, it&rsquo;s always the same bee&hellip;<br />
&ldquo;Den Fahrscheine bitte!&rdquo;<br />
Only now it seems&hellip; You&rsquo;ve sprung out of the closet and taken off pell&#8209;mell&hellip; you hear the soldiers&rsquo; boots behind you, your pajamas have come undone and your cheeks are full of lather, only half&#8209;shaved, running, at a gallop you knock against the walls, the compartment windows : shining, smoky, dark. You&rsquo;re in a tgv, in a freight train, in an intercity and foreign faces watch you in a strained way ; you run, run, run ! Look an empty compartment&hellip; someone opens the door with a decisive hand, utters flatly :<br />
&ldquo;Gli biglietti, prego!&rdquo;<br />
So that the suspicious faces in the corridor should believe that the one you watch has entered the empty compartment&hellip; his face flashes in the emptiness of the mirror &ndash; it&rsquo;s his cap, it&rsquo;s your face; hide quickly &ndash; where?<br />
Calm down. It&rsquo;s the same dream; this happened before at&hellip; you have experienced this before &ndash; where? You don&rsquo;t remember when, you don&rsquo;t remember where, ah, how tedious&hellip; You rummage in your pockets for blood pressure pills. You come up with cigarettes, drops, crumpled pages. Only you don&rsquo;t recognise the language in which the text for conference is written &ndash; you don&rsquo;t recall the alphabet. What will you read to the audience then? You don&rsquo;t know. But now you&rsquo;ve got up from your place at the window of the tgv, of the intercity. You&rsquo;re well hidden in this freight train. You clean your pipe ostentatiously as though getting ready to go out in the corridor, but why this disapproving silence? Ah, yes! It&rsquo;s a non&#8209;smoking compartment &ndash; it&rsquo;s forbidden to smoke in the train &ndash; you&rsquo;ve crawled under the bench, you crouch, you make yourself small, smaller, even smaller among the turning wheels. You squat on all fours and you hold your breath, from there, from the luggage rack where you&rsquo;ve clambered, you see the shadow that darkens the glass. <br />
&ldquo;Good morning, bitte! Vos billets mesdames, messieurs s&rsquo;il vous plait !&rdquo;<br />
Now the door of the compartment is going to open and crouching, scared, you&rsquo;ll somersault into the darkness cut by blinding wreaths of light.<br />
Above, on the overpass, look there&rsquo;s a soldier with rifle at the ready, motionless, a statue.<br />
&ldquo;Who are you ? Where have you come from ? Where are you going ? Show me your papers ! Answer !&rdquo;<br />
You&rsquo;ve sprung out from under the bench, your horrified face flashes in the emptiness of a mirror.<br />
&ldquo;Your papers!&rdquo; shout the customs officers, the border guards, and they beat the door of the empty compartment with their rifle butts. <br />
&ldquo;Your papers ! Who are you ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Where are you going ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What are you doing here ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Answer, or I&rsquo;ll shoot !&rdquo;<br />
* * *<br />
Don&rsquo;t be afraid, relax, it&rsquo;s the same tormenting dream. In order to wake up, you&rsquo;ve dug your soft nails into the soft flesh. You try to make a fist of your flaccid hand, but you&rsquo;re still here. Whatever you do, forget it, you can&rsquo;t escape&hellip; you run madly &ndash; look, there&rsquo;s the conductor&rsquo;s uniform at the end of the corridor &ndash; you race toward him like a lunatic, it&rsquo;s too late to turn back now, it&rsquo;s too late&hellip;you can&rsquo;t pretend not to see him any more, he&rsquo;s in front of you, two steps away.<br />
&ldquo;Your papers !&rdquo; the words come from behind. <br />
* * *<br />
How many times have you not sat like that, in the deserted station&hellip; getting ready to leave&hellip; coming from school ; with a trembling hand, you wipe your brows, your damp cheeks&hellip; good : you&rsquo;ve managed to escape from that train full of conductors and armed soldiers&hellip; if only the red spots &ndash; like blood &ndash; would disappear for once from the wet cement and the ringing that pierces your temples, the back of your neck&hellip; you look randomly at the young, reddish fur that is sliding across the sleepers under the train&hellip; how much this dog looks like your Federigo at home, that way of arching his bushy tail, his tensed legs.<br />
&ldquo;Fede ! Fede !&rdquo; you cry out, but the dog growls under the train and starts sniffing. What trail is he following ? Could it be yours ? Only now you&rsquo;ve turned your back so as not to be recognised by the two sullen soldiers &ndash; rifles clenched in their fists.<br />
&ldquo;Your papers !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Where are you going ? Answer !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Where have you come from ? Show us your papers !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Halt ! Halt or I&rsquo;ll shoot !&rdquo;<br />
* * *<br />
You move hurriedly, you run, quickly, quicker, even quicker &ndash; you sense the station behind you growing smaller, ever smaller, and the red stains, like fresh blood, throb on the fogbound footpath where you advance on weakening legs, your shoes wet with dew. There&rsquo;s a sudden change of sounds, of colours, of light. The intense green of the fir trees climbs up toward the mist&#8209;swathed slope beneath : the tender green of the meadows, the viscid footpath where you crush fibrous tufts of bride grass with boots that pinch you, be careful not to slip ! Careful not to&hellip;<br />
How many times have you been this way, this way, like this&hellip; at the same time, with you, at every step, countless legs climb the cement steps of the bridge below &ndash; the water : three tiny strands, sucked by sandy tongues&hellip; great, rounded boulders with run&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;mill, seasonal tourists on top. Soft, whitish corpses waiting in vain for the sun to come again over the shadow&#8209;studded land. Thus came we to the bourn of deep&#8209;flowing Ocean. / There the city of the Cimmerian tribe doth lie, / By fog and darkness enveloped. Never upon them / Doth the radiant Sun cast down his rays.<br />
* * *<br />
Here is the DRY CLEANER&rsquo;S, the signboard attached to the dirty, white wall, stuck in the sandy earth, here is the sheeting case for the eiderdown &ndash; rough whitish&#8209;yellow shrouds, hung up to dry &ndash; above them puffy black curls flow over the heads of the ones who ceaselessly debark. They take down suitcases, satchels, sacks, valises, candles adorned with paper flowers, big wooden boxes, coffins. You pant. You wipe your damp cheeks with your tremulous hand, you clench your hand on the balustrade, you don&rsquo;t dare to look into the astounding emptiness for fear of slipping off the cement steps into the cold gloom. Who had you make such a trip, stranger, through fog and darkness ?<br />
* * *<br />
Precisely because you know the verse very well, you realise that you&rsquo;ve made a mistake, who had you make such a trip, stranger, through fog and darkness, but what follows ? Your bench is right near the open window, a flowering apple bough touches the sill, bunches of puffy bees and pink flowers heap up among the little green leaves. <br />
&ldquo;&hellip;hey, come in,&rdquo; you whisper to your bee, &ldquo;come in and sting Mr. &hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;&hellip;than talking to yourself in your corner, come up and recite in front of the class,&rdquo; says the teacher, arming himself with the ruler from his desk. <br />
You&rsquo;re not afraid of the teacher&rsquo;s ruler. For 20 lei you make cheat sheets for ancient Greek and Latin, for the lads in the upper classes, but your memory lapses right now; that&rsquo;s why you repeat the poetry to yourself in a whisper on the way to the head of the class, but is there anything harder in life than the road that you have chosen alone through fog and darkness ? <br />
On the floorboards blackened by diesel oil, between the two rows of benches pink stains throb under your boots; there are pink flowers from the flowering apple tree outside, a light breath of wind cast them through window ; febrile, you walk tensely over the shiny floor, the mirror, be careful not to slip, be careful not to slip ! You clear your throat ; you arrange your face that flashes in the emptiness of the open window. Is it your face ? It seems it&rsquo;s not. You recite: hapless man, better abandon the road to rocky Ithaca rather than wander for years through darkness and fog toward the place where no one awaits you any more. <br />
* * *<br />
You&rsquo;ve made a mistake. The word is on the tip of your tongue, but you don&rsquo;t remember it any more, you have a lapse and your tongue cleaves to the roof of your mouth&hellip; you search hurriedly in your inside pocket, where you keep your wallet ; it&rsquo;s empty, only a bit of change, small and black. A little hole in the middle &ndash; a Mycenaean coin, Assyrian, Egyptian &ndash; you hold it in your clenched fist&hellip; they&rsquo;ll ask you for it in the car park, then when you cross the bridge. You don&rsquo;t find the crumpled sheets with the text of the conference to see where you made your mistake, but what luck ! The teacher is deaf : he doesn&rsquo;t hear; he too has grown old in the meantime.<br />
&ldquo;Good morning, mesdames, messieurs, vos billets, s&rsquo;il vous plait,&rdquo; intones the teacher in a melodious low baritone.<br />
Rapping the door with the ruler, he&rsquo;s put his cap on his head and gone out. You stay alone in the empty classroom ; you can&rsquo;t leave, if you don&rsquo;t remember the verse, even if they&rsquo;re waiting for you at home with the table laid. Will they still recognise you&hellip; won&rsquo;t they recognise you any more, after so many years of wandering over the seas, through storm and fog ?<br />
* * *<br />
There&rsquo;s the spire of the church in the valley. Once you have arrived next to them, nothing will remain except to cross the street, and then you&rsquo;re home. What astonished faces they&rsquo;ll have, what shouts of joy they&rsquo;ll give when they see you ! Will they recognise you ? Won&rsquo;t they recognise you, after so many years of wandering alone in darkness and fog ? So many years have passed since you left&hellip; it was only yesterday that they drove you to the station. <br />
You try to make out something through the old fence laths: you stand on tiptoes trying to look in the courtyard, but the fence is too high and the green paint sticks to the tips of your fingers. The fence has just been painted ; you painted it yourself yesterday before leaving for the station. The house is red, made of brick ; they didn&rsquo;t get to finish it because the bank went bust. The banks were nationalised, all of them. The bank won&rsquo;t give them credit any more because you&rsquo;ve left home.<br />
Now you&rsquo;re under the cypress at the gate, and you ask yourself : should I draw the bolt ? Shouldn&rsquo;t I ? Look what a table they&rsquo;ve laid in the courtyard, a wedding repast, a baptismal or funeral repast. I told them that after his many adventures and after he lost his comrades, after twenty years, he&rsquo;d get back home, unknown to all, and all that is fulfilling itself now.<br />
* * *<br />
How tedious, how excruciating! How many times you have not stood here under the plum tree with you hand on the barely opened gate, ready to give it a shove !<br />
A child with a dirty face and a bare bottom rises near the fence and pulls up his trousers. Whose child might this be, with snot shining silvery on his cheeks like the sun&#8209;dried slime of a snail? You&rsquo;ve lost sight of him in the courtyard full of the buzz of bees, of sunlight&hellip; it&rsquo;s summer, it&rsquo;s spring&hellip; And this child, left to sprout up on his own like a weed, you know him&hellip; you&rsquo;ve seen him somewhere before, where ? Ah, yes ! Your mother always carried a picture of him in her purse, a sepia photograph, with coffee or oil stains and dog&#8209;eared corners.<br />
* * *<br />
Heavy, deliberate steps on the gravel with your stiff, shrivelled footwear, you would like to have all eyes raised toward you, to see you, to hear you. They sit at the table, and the shadow of the pine covers their faces, but is there a pine ? Was there a cypress in your yard ? A pine in the yard brings bad luck, it&rsquo;s well known, whereas you saw the cypress in Rome.<br />
You tramp over the pebbles in your dusty, worn&#8209;out footwear, heavy, deliberate steps &ndash; only you see them, their eyes turned toward you&hellip; so that you can tell them, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have found you ! Enjoy your meal !&rdquo; Except that they keep eating their meal, they don&rsquo;t even look at you. <br />
And yet they must have known that you were coming, otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t all be here, all of them, all. So they&rsquo;re all living&hellip; no one has died. So the letters, telegrams, announcements of death were all untrue ! What happiness, what relief, Oh Lord ! Mother and father, look at them sitting as usual at the end of the table. And Mama, who keeps getting up as she always does for a glass of wine or a breadbasket ! So they are living, so they&rsquo;re alive ! Lord God, what a miracle, what joy, how good ! The rest was all a lie, dream, illusion&hellip; All you believed, all you suffered all these years, for nothing&hellip;<br />
* * *<br />
You go closer &ndash; smiling broadly, happily &ndash; even if they go on talking among themselves in low voices, as if they didn&rsquo;t see you, as if they didn&rsquo;t hear your steps&hellip; No one raises his eyes to you&hellip; all they do is pour wine, water into each other&rsquo;s glasses. <br />
And you, who made such a long journey to get here&hellip; for so many tortured nights, you ran through trains full of ticket collectors and soldiers&hellip; you&rsquo;re too tired to savour the joke. And if they don&rsquo;t understand, then at least she, at least she should be able to understand.<br />
&ldquo;Mama !&rdquo; you cry in a low voice.<br />
But it&rsquo;s clear she hasn&rsquo;t heard you, she&rsquo;s old, poor thing, her senses have dimmed.<br />
&ldquo;Mama !&rdquo;<br />
You try to cry louder, but you strain your voice in vain, your straining vocal chords emit only an indistinct throaty sound.<br />
&ldquo;Mama !&rdquo;<br />
You strive, you strain desperately, but you can&rsquo;t hear your own voice, and you cast no shadow on the grass. How can it be ? Not even she turns her face toward you. And you, who spent all night jumping from one train to the other, hiding under the banquettes, in trains guarded by armed soldiers, you came all the way here in pajamas, barefoot, with your cheeks full of lather, only half&#8209;shaved! As though from another life, as though from a dream, you remember all that you suffered on this endless journey, and she doesn&rsquo;t even ask you, &ldquo;is that you, my dear ?&rdquo; Or else shout: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him, Him, it is, Lord God, how can I thank you for having lived to see this day, to see him here, with us, among our own? Come to me, you, my dearest. So many people have been waiting for you for so long, after all ! Come on, say something ! Are you thirsty ? Are you hungry ? Are you tired ? Say something !&rdquo; Only there is nothing more difficult than to come hither, through fog and darkness&hellip;<br />
But she remains silent. She sits stock&#8209;still, with her head turned, the shadow of the cypress tree covers her face, and what else can you do then but call out one more time:<br />
&ldquo;Mama !&rdquo;<br />
* * *<br />
She looks at you in astonishment.<br />
&ldquo;What do you want, stranger ?&rdquo;<br />
Have you really changed so much that even she doesn&rsquo;t recognise you anymore ?<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Mama! It&rsquo;s me, your son! Why do you call me stranger ?&rdquo;<br />
How ill you must look if her gaze fills with pity and her voice softens all of a sudden :<br />
Hapless man! Who knows where you come from ? How much you have suffered, if you don&rsquo;t even remember your mother. Come on, sit down, have a glass of wine, a piece of bread ! No one will die if before leaving you pause awhile to catch your breath.<br />
&ldquo;Leave to go where ?&rdquo; you whisper exhausted.<br />
&ldquo;What do you mean, where ? To your own country, back to where you came from. After all, it&rsquo;s obvious you&rsquo;re not one of us&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What makes it look like that ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What do you mean, what makes it look like that ? Your walk, your coat.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Come on, stop joking, Mama ! You can see that I&rsquo;m too tired, and I don&rsquo;t feel like joking !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Hapless man ! Maybe you were in prison and you lost your mind there because of all you suffered if you keep thinking that I&rsquo;m your mother for good and all.&rdquo;<br />
No, she&rsquo;s not joking! She really didn&rsquo;t recognise you, poor woman! To what state has old age reduced her if she doesn&rsquo;t realise that this is your voice that trembles now, impatient and irritated ?<br />
&ldquo;What else do you want me to call you ? I&rsquo;ve never called you anything but Mama !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You must be ill, very ill, hapless man, if you have no idea of when you&rsquo;re awake, of when you&rsquo;re dreaming, things so simple that even a child knows them! It&rsquo;s a terrible illness not to know who you are any more.&rdquo;<br />
* * *<br />
&ldquo;Who else could I be ? I&rsquo;m me !&rdquo;<br />
They&rsquo;ve all raised their heads ; they look at you. <br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, for God&rsquo;s sake ! Can&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s me, me, me, me !&rdquo;<br />
They remain silent.<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, your son, brother nephew, uncle, brother&#8209;in&#8209;law !&rdquo;<br />
The tense faces around the table look at you as though through glass. She smiles sadly ; she waves her hand in disgust :<br />
&ldquo;How good it would be if you were you, but you can&rsquo;t be ! If you were you, you wouldn&rsquo;t be here with us, you&rsquo;d be far away ! If you were you, you&rsquo;d have gone to the realm beyond ; you&rsquo;d be with the dead.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Take a good look at me,&rdquo; you cry out to them. &ldquo;I am still me, except that seven years have passed, fourteen, twenty, since I left ! I couldn&rsquo;t stay the way I was in the photographs ! I&rsquo;m weaker, older, it was a long journey to get here, I&rsquo;m unwashed, in rags, unshaven. I couldn&rsquo;t look at myself, not even by candlelight! And I can&rsquo;t even tell how much I&rsquo;ve changed because here, at your place, the mirrors are covered, all of them&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
How tedious, how excruciating! How many times has he not lived this scene in the same way ? Those around the table set for a baptism, for a funeral repast, for a marriage &ndash; smiling in embarrassed silence &ndash; and you crying out nervously :<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, except that I&rsquo;ve put on weight since I switched from cigarettes to pipe&#8209;smoking. But I haven&rsquo;t got that fat either, not so fat that you wouldn&rsquo;t recognise me !&rdquo;<br />
They&rsquo;ve got up from their chairs: they make as though to come closer, they whisper among themselves, they all cry out, their voices all overlap at the same time.<br />
&ldquo;Who is it you say you belong to ? What family do you come from?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;He claims to be one of the family !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But where are you suitcases ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;If you were he, you wouldn&rsquo;t have turned up unshaven and barefoot at the wedding !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Whose relative did he say he was ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;If you were he, you&rsquo;d be wearing a Rolex and you&rsquo;d have a huge Mercedes at the gate !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not him. Don&rsquo;t you see his shiny shoes ? Don&rsquo;t you see the expensive coat ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;An impostor, mind your own business !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Who do you belong to ? What are you doing here ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Who do you belong to ? Answer.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Sssst! Let him go. Don&rsquo;t you see ? He&rsquo;s from Securitate !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;A hapless madman ! Look at the state he&rsquo;s in! A hapless madman, escaped from a madhouse !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;A dangerous madman !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Be careful, I&rsquo;ve told you who he&rsquo;s with !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;They sent him here to test us ! He wants to hear what we say, what we talk about, so that he can inform on us !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Ssshhhh ! We don&rsquo;t have any foreign relatives over there !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We only have one, who&rsquo;s been dead for a long while !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We celebrated his seventh anniversary !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;His fourteenth !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;His twenty&#8209;first !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;An impostor !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;An informer !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see how he&rsquo;s looking all around ? How&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;None of our people went abroad. Understand that, stranger !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We have no relatives over there !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to leave the country !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been further than our garden gate !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Be careful ! He&rsquo;s only playing the madman so he can hear what we say and report it afterwards !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;If you were he, they wouldn&rsquo;t have let you cross the frontier !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;If you were he, you wouldn&rsquo;t be carrying suitcases with a broken zip all tied up with rope !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;If you were he, you&rsquo;d be dead in Donbass !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;At Stalingrad&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What the devil, after all, we all agreed to say he&rsquo;d died on the western front at Tatra !&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Did anyone see you, stranger, when you came through our gate ?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;He should leave and mind his own business ! Don&rsquo;t you see the people gathering on the street by our fence, as if to see a bear !<br />
Come on, give him something for the road, and stop dawdling ! Here&rsquo;s a plastic bag, apples, bread&hellip; take what you want from here and go !<br />
* * *<br />
They&rsquo;ve turned their backs on you. They eat quietly with eyes fixed on their dishes. Well&#8209;disposed, they pour wine, water into each other&rsquo;s glasses.<br />
It&rsquo;s me, I&rsquo;m one of you ! Take a good look at me, you cry out to them ; I am your son, your brother, your nephew, your cousin ! We were all together three months ago, thirteen years ago&hellip; We&rsquo;ve known each other since the cradle after all, since we were little, we slept in the same bed, we ate from the same pot, we were in love with the same girl&hellip; I&rsquo;ve come such a long way to tell you that if I had known what I would endure I would never have left our yard. I&rsquo;ve come such a long way only because I promised you I would return ; otherwise, I would never have set foot here in the yard !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
You move only your lips. A rattle comes out of your throat, a bee flies above you and the shadow of the cypress tree covers your face. Your voice can&rsquo;t be heard, and your body doesn&rsquo;t cast a shadow on the grass. Relax, let it go, it&rsquo;s only a dream, the same bothersome, tedious dream&hellip;<br />
&ndash; Wake up, come on, make a little effort and get up ! Do you want to make me fall asleep too ? Wake up ! We&rsquo;ve had a slight delay. We took the wrong exit, but now we&rsquo;ll turn right, and in two hours, at the most, we&rsquo;ll be in front of the town hall where the hotel is ! Wake up, and take the way back through fog and darkness&hellip;</p>

14 A Vanished World O lume disparuta Memories "Ego-grafii" series,  2004, 464 pages Polirom All rights available <p>The endeavour of the four authors - Paul Cernat, Ion Manolescu, Angelo Mitchievici, Ioan Stanomir - of this book is spectacular. In turn, each of them descends into his own history, seeking details, the &ldquo;madeleines&rdquo; of a past epoch, of a vanished world : that of Romanian communism. However, the result is by no means an attempt to salvage in any way the ideology that scarred Romania for almost half a century. On the contrary, by assembling minor personal histories, which construct a kind of glossary, an insectarium of childhood and juvenile life in communist Romania, the authors thereby unveil, in the background, a grotesque, painful and absurd tableau. Written with nostalgia for one&rsquo;s personal past, but at the same time in a tone that acquires the necessary gravity when personal history intersects with the wider, terrible and dramatic narrative of Romanian society, the histories contained in this book touch upon a multitude of topics, from episodes connected to the pioneer&rsquo;s red cravat to the films that attempted to indoctrinate at an early age, from food queues to &ldquo;contraband&rdquo; cigarettes, from innocent childhood games to obligatory participation in the mass rallies organised on the occasions of official Communist Party holidays. Gradually, an Orwellian atmosphere is created, blurred, nonetheless, by the eyes through which it is filtered : the eyes of innocence, capable of seeing in the most dramatic of episodes something pleasing and innocent, in which children, as yet incapable of understanding the realities of the surrounding world in all their harshness, prefer to take refuge.</p> <p>When citrus fruits disappeared from the shops, it was rumoured that they were &ldquo;irradiated.&rdquo; When soft drinks were not to be found, they were &ldquo;infested.&rdquo; The poverty of foodstuffs was aberrantly explained by &ldquo;rumour&#8209;mongers&rdquo; as due to profiteers named &ldquo;hamsters&rdquo; who were stashing goods in vaults. Black marketeers were, in theory, hunted down. However, they used to get on with business very nicely indeed, in collusion with the authorities, who would sacrifice a scapegoat every now and then in order to quell the fury of the famished. Such was the case of the notorious wine&#8209;trafficker &#350;tef&#259;nescu, who was sentenced to death and about whom two police comedy films had been made, The Secret of Bacchus and the Secret of Nemesis. It is no less true that life for the &ldquo;lads&rdquo; was by no means easy. Each spied on the other, in a circle. Many Securitate agents were alcoholics ; they would periodically admit themselves to detox clinics. The stress continually wore them down. Once you had entered the apparatus, you would only leave feet first.<br />
During breaks, there continued the ritual I had already encountered in nursery school, in secondary school, in my block, during visits, in queues, on the bus : provocation. Sometimes it was the teachers who were the provocateurs. You could &ldquo;read&rdquo; them straight away. I was already well versed in how to keep my guard up, I knew that people have a weakness for demonstrating their authority and domination over others. Therefore, you had to flatter their pride by saying what they wanted to hear or else stutter and avoid answering. During breaks, it was always the same ones who would tell the political jokes, inopportunely setting the tone with a crack about Ceau&#351;escu. The others, courageous but dupes, would enter into the spirit &ndash; there were very few that kept aloof &ndash; and, as in my case, tell dirty jokes or else apolitical ones about John and Sir. Spying on their methods, I learnt how to &ldquo;interpret&rdquo; at first hand the way in which the system thought. I had empirically familiarised myself with all the elements of counterespionage, diversionary tactics, misinformation and camouflage, the &ldquo;art of prudence.&rdquo; I was fascinated by their secret sect mentality. They were snoopers who wanted to control Everything, to find out what you were thinking &ndash; they were not able to penetrate inside my mind, however. Dialogues were often subliminal : each person sensed what the other was trying to avoid saying and sought to guess why. We spoke &ldquo;in code,&rdquo; looking for the other&rsquo;s &ldquo;passwords,&rdquo; we tried to tried to pick up on and thwart the strategy as we went. Neighbours from the block, acquaintances, colleagues, friends &ndash; I studied them all with a perverse voluptuousness, concealed behind shyness. In our class, the number of those whose families collaborated at varying levels with the Securitate was, on the basis of my &ldquo;empirical&rdquo; observations, enormous &ndash; not to mention the presumable percentage of neighbours in my block. I think the number of occasional or permanent informers was much larger than the number of members in the Romanian Communist Party. The number of child and adolescent &ldquo;collaborators&rdquo; seemed proportional to that of the parents, the assimilation had, in part, been accomplished. But nevertheless, in many families of Securitate agents, there were conflicts between the generations : some parents of the &ldquo;heavies,&rdquo; simple folk from the countryside, were transformed into servants and subjected to &ldquo;familial&rdquo; humiliations&hellip; <br />
(Paul Cernat, chapter &ldquo;In the midst of the Securitate&rdquo;)<br />
*<br />
With these fascicles of reality and residues of memory, I nourished and clothed communism, I set its combination of flesh, bones and microphones in motion, dragging it behind me like a filthy and delirious illness. I was the proprietor of a neuronal archive of data, images and sensations that I was to preserve piously, safe from the prying eyes of the Securitate. Without their knowledge, I was to transport through time my collection of lost objects and useless memories, in an insane dual against death.<br />
As for dying, one had all the time and all the occasions in the world for that. In one queue (assembled by the well known false alarm of &ldquo;the meat lorry is coming,&rdquo; which used to bring people out from all over the place, causing them scurry about like ants), my seventy&#8209;five year&#8209;old grandfather stood for twelve hours : on the street corner from six in the morning until six in the evening. When he got home, with an empty bag (that day, the lorry had not turned up), he started to feel unwell, leaned on the bed and collapsed. This former interbellic country gentleman &ndash; vineyard owner and horse breeder in the foothills of the Leaota Mountain, denounced by a friend, arrested and beaten by the Securitate in the time of Dej because he had hidden some &ldquo;cockerels&rdquo; &ndash; had now exhausted all his energy for the sake of a bit of meat on the bone. Later, struck down with sclerosis and bedridden with semi&#8209;paralysis, he was to come round once every few days, to ask the family he had once provided for : &ldquo;Bread ? Is there bread ?&rdquo;<br />
You could just as easily endure the same at Christmas, setting off into town in search of a tree. After about 1985, the firs started to be replaced with pine and spruce (which didn&rsquo;t have a smell and would shed their needles in the house after about three days). You would take all the markets in turn (Obor, Matache, Amzei, 1 May, Domenii) and find nothing. Then, as if by miracle, two or three vendors in rat&#8209;grey overalls would turn up and pile some shrubs into a pen cordoned off with wood and string, but because of the pushing of the crowd you wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to get a glimpse. That&rsquo;s how the fight for Christmas trees would start, a fight in the literal sense : punched mouths, trodden toes, swearing and ripped off branches. Arriving home ruffled and empty&shy;&#8209;handed after one such adventure, my father decided to give up &ldquo;buying&rdquo; Christmas trees from socialist trade. However, since for both him and the entire family Christmas was a joyous celebration (from the day I was born, the house had never lacked a tree), he found another solution. He learned from a colleague at work that, at the main train station, some firs were secretly going to be brought in from Moldavia on the locomotive of the train from Suceava or Vatra Dornei. So, on the night of the 22nd or 23rd, he waited for the carriages to pull up to the platform, got talking with the engine driver and, after the last passenger had left, paid him a hundred lei for one of the three or four majestic firs stashed in the locomotive.<br />
(Ion Manolescu, chapter &ldquo;What became of us ?&rdquo;)<br />

Coffee. How many people can imagine morning without a cup of coffee ? Without a cigarette ? Coffee had been replaced by a product ironically dubbed nechezol. The term seems to come from the verb a necheza (&ldquo;to whinny&rdquo;), but I don&rsquo;t know its etymology for certain. It was made from chickpeas combined with who knows what and drunk as a substitute for coffee. Advantage : no caffeine. Disadvantage : it wasn&rsquo;t coffee. With a lot of imagination, you might think you were drinking bad coffee. The worst. The cigarettes were bad too : Carpathians, M&#259;r&#259;&#351;e&#351;ti, Snagov, the latter of which were the only ones with filters. Other cigarettes became harder and harder to find, these others mainly being a single brand : Kent. The cigarette of head managers, doctors and university professors. The first cigarettes I ever smoked, with artlessness and stoicism, were Carpathians, all extremely evil&shy;&#8209;smelling, suffocating &ndash; you would end up with half the tobacco in your mouth if you didn&rsquo;t have the knack. Bad cigarettes spoiled what for me could have been a promising career as a smoker. Even when I came across better ones, like Vikend, or BT, their Bulgarian counterparts, my fervour had already been quenched ; the stoicism I mention had already vanished. My mother used packets of cigarettes against moths, in the absence of mothballs. It seems they produce results. When she found mothballs, she would still alternate them with the cigarettes. Not even the moths could stand the cheap tobacco. In the celebrated &ldquo;Eugenia&rdquo; sandwich biscuit, which I used to eat in the absence of anything else &ndash; a kind of poor man&rsquo;s dessert, to be found at almost every kiosk &ndash; the layer of cream kept getting thinner, until it all but disappeared. Latterly, you used to find only a meagre sliver sticking the two biscuits together. The gypsy women used to sell us sunflower seeds, but I never learned how to spit out the husk in an artistic way, so I would swallow them whole. We used to get nougat from them too, as well as reddish&#8209;coloured apples on sticks, also drizzled with nougat. They were very good, in spite of all the warnings about how they were made in the chamber pots of the vendors in question. Batons, a kind of elongated and extremely insipid loaf of bread, had also disappeared. We used to get foreign chewing gum from the black marketeers : Malabar, Tin Tin, or packets with the faces of three footballers. &ldquo;Gumela,&rdquo; a Romanian chewing gum, which built up the muscles, used to come in the form of a white or pink cigarette, not that they were any different. It was brittle, you would chew it vigorously and the flavour vanished instantaneously. You were left with gutta&#8209;percha, a rubber that would break your jaw, and after a while it was as if you were munching a flexor. You couldn&rsquo;t blow bubbles with it and it soon became too hard for it to be worth continuing the effort. Consequently, you would champ on it a couple of times and then throw it away, or you could stick it to the plush seats in the cinema, or the chairs in cafes, or the benches in classrooms, where it would rapidly harden, like rock. Decades from now, the sensitive and nostalgic anthropologists of a new world will find traces of these laborious activities. In storerooms stacked with old furniture, in dusty warehouses, in basements lined with mould and cobwebs, on the benches of God&#8209;forsaken schools in the Carpathian Mountains. In Craiova, Bucharest and Constan&thorn;a. In Romania. Everywhere. In my soul.<br />
(Angelo Mitchievici, chapter &ldquo;Total Recall&rdquo;)<br />
*<br />
Recyclable materials were part of everyday life for a secondary school pupil such as myself, to the same degree as homework or sports lessons. At the edge of the school, sited between mountains of paper and guarded by a dog, there was a caravan which had been converted into the headquarters for collection of the paper and bottles gathered by the youth of socialist Romania. Like adults, children were given obligatory quotas, and speed in meeting them would bring an increase in pioneer respectability.<br />
A natural bond developed between socialist humanism and the collection of recyclable materials : the collection of paper provided the perfect opportunity to play truant for a few hours. When the teachers were called upon to enlighten the Eighth Form in the mysteries of subjects that were unknown even to them, waste paper appeared as a natural refuge and egress from difficulty : mutual satisfaction was guaranteed. I warmly recall how the only Latin lesson of the week became, at the initiative of comrade teacher, an hour dedicated to the gleaning of detritus. Since our school had no Latin teacher, given that the number of hours was not sufficient to provide a full&#8209;time job, the subject was allocated, by rotation, to the History, Romanian and English teachers, who were clearly far from charmed at the prospect. The paper pact solved an equation with many unknowns.<br />
Waste paper seemed a fascinating object in itself. Rummaging with my classmates in the school basement, where the collection quotas were stored, with a view to centralisation, I encountered almost everything the homeland&rsquo;s press system had to offer : from Historical Magazine to Woman Magazine, next to the books grandparents used charitably to donate to their grandchildren, so that they could fulfil their debt of fealty to the school. In the short interval that separated storage and transfer to the collection centre, an illicit operation of sifting through the garbage used to take place. Each of us would choose a magazine or book, according to our tastes, either intellectual or sporting. With us, these books&rsquo; adventure would begin anew, only to end just as abruptly, when the folks at home used to realise their far too humble origins. The circulation of bartered books and magazines related to the regulations of education through labour and for labour.<br />

15 Exuviae Exuvii Novel "Fiction LTD" series, Polirom, 2007, 328 pages Polirom Pont Kiado (Hungary), Czarne (Poland) <p>This is a novel of childhood, of the childhood of a narrator here identified with the author. With exceptional delicacy, Simona Popescu reconstructs a childhood of defeats. Memories are bathed in aromas, in childhood sensations ; minor happenings acquire major significance. The author seems to have a treasure chest of memories, which she extracts one by one, in order to charm the reader with their textures, with details that extend into narrative miniatures. Thus, for the delight of the reader, there appear a wealth of stylistic and narrative jewels : from the world as seen from the closet where the quilt is kept to other hollows, as the author calls those places invested with fairytale properties by children ; from the young girl&rsquo;s fascination with cookery books &ndash; not the recipes in them, but rather the drawings that embellish them &ndash; to her innocent but smile&shy;&#8209;provoking thoughts about God, Whom she ardently wants to see in a photograph, for which she is even prepared to offer her hair bobbles in exchange... A book redolent with nostalgia, with a music of memories perfectly tuned and conducted by the author, subtly gliding across the keys of time and introducing us, be it only partially, into a world that has been lost by us all. It is the story of a little girl, and then of an adolescent who refuses to grow up, precisely for fear of losing contact with those things which might seem minor, but which, in fact, constitute the charm of existence&hellip; of an existence that owes much to childhood, with all its strange and not so strange stories.</p> <p>What did they understand by &ldquo;talking about love&rdquo; ? All they used to do was to gossip about the guys who were head over heels for them, to boast about their tactics for keeping a tight leash on them or making mincemeat of their rivals. Sometimes, they would get jealous of some girl or other who was itching at the thought of hooking (or nicking) those boyfriends of theirs. The latter, it seems, had varied qualities : either they would look like some actor or singer, or they would have death&rsquo;s head key&#8209;rings, tee&#8209;shirts &ldquo;from abroad,&rdquo; thousand&#8209;lei Pumas on their feet, and bicycles, or else they would come first at running in sport. They would even go so far as to show me the love letters (somewhat ungrammatical and closing with a scrawled LOVE) which the poor lads committed the imprudence of sending them, unaware, poor things, that they were thereby entering straight into the wolf&rsquo;s mouth. But that&rsquo;s how they used to make a spectacle of themselves in front of each other, because otherwise each of them had come to me to babble her little secret about love. I knew what was in their minds. I knew all too well.<br />
Then, another day, on the bus, I overheard a conversation between two schoolgirls. One of them, a rather ugly girl, with her hair tied in a pony tail with umpteen elastic bows and a miniature panda at the end, wearing a plastic wristwatch, kept telling the other one about how Gabi wants to pinch Dorobantzu from her. She kept going on about this Dorobantzu, who, it was plain to see, was a bit of a skirt&shy;&#8209;chaser. The wee girl was very upset. I eavesdropped for as long as I could, but I think that they must have caught on because they shut up and started giving me a dirty look, while I pretended to be engrossed by the brooch of some old woman, a sinister brooch in the form of a fat and ugly spider perched on her similarly fat and ugly bosom. Another time, I was to hear a similar conversation as I was queuing for some bread. My grown&#8209;up mind knows, knows all too well, what is in their minds, what they mean to say with their simple, straightforward language.<br />
Half&#8209;knapsack (I&rsquo;ve no idea where the name came from) could be played with flowers, films, animals, cars, or &ldquo;lads and lasses&rdquo;.<br />
You stood in a line, one next to the other, lads and lasses, younger or older. Two would go to one side, whisper whatever they had to whisper, decide on a number, stop in front of each one and challenge you : &ldquo;Half !&rdquo; And you had to guess the number, and if you guessed right you were free to choose between the pair who had given themselves the names of flowers, if the game was with flowers, or of films, if it was with films, but most of all the names of girls or boys. They always knew what names to give themselves when it came to &ldquo;lads and lasses&rdquo;, so that you would be put in a corner and have to answer in front of everybody that between Lulu and Harry you chose Harry. And then Harry would blush, and that&rsquo;s how the game would become a kind of indirect declaration of love. The only thing was that I wouldn&rsquo;t choose Harry, whom I loved very much, but rather Lulu, because I was embarrassed to say what I felt in front of Harry. But I knew that he knew more than anybody else that it wasn&rsquo;t possible for you to like Lulu, who was too old for you, four or five years older, and who, apart from anything else, was insufferable, because he called you &ldquo;bowl&#8209;head&rdquo; (your parents had given you a &ldquo;bowl&#8209;cut&rdquo;, quite a fashionable hairstyle at the time, copied from that chanteuse, Mireille Mathieu). But did he know ?<br />
Then there was that game with numbers, whose rules I&rsquo;ve more or less forgotten. A wee girl would ask you some questions, and do some calculations until she came up with a number in the tens or hundreds. Then she would look it up in a little table, where, next to each figure, there was written a simple and comical announcement of the type : he&rsquo;s cheating on you or he likes blondes ; he loves you but he&rsquo;s shy ; he loves another ; he&rsquo;s thinking of you ; he&rsquo;s deceiving you ; you are going to meet ; you are going to split up ; you&rsquo;re going to have an argument ; he&rsquo;s got a surprise for you ; you&rsquo;re going to get a present from him. And we would religiously believe in these verdicts &ndash; not to mention that, don&rsquo;t ask me how, they sometimes came true, especially the one with you&rsquo;re going to have an argument. There was also another answer there, which I used to covet the most when I was thinking about Harry : you are going to marry him. Lord, how much I wanted to get married to Harry, to be with him day after day, all my life (all my life !), to bring him milky coffee in bed, all day long to watch cartoons or shoot&#8209;&rsquo;em&#8209;up films (he liked them, but I&rsquo;d get quite bored). To watch Vanadana and cry on each other&rsquo;s shoulders, to go to the market together, to have five children, a dog and, without fail, a cat. To wake up next to him in the morning. To talk about UFOs, about ghosts and monsters, to get frightened and, trembling with fear, to hug until it passed, then to sleep on his shoulder, to hold each other from evening until morning. To drink lemonade or even beer, to eat peanuts and stuff ourselves with ice&#8209;cream, to dance to lilting music in each other&rsquo;s arms, to sit around the fire in winter and so on. We would play this game a number of times a day, and sometimes it would come out he&rsquo;s cheating on you, sometimes he loves you, sometimes you are gong to split up, so that I would never be able to understand anything and would start all over again the next day, seeking out that girl with her table. And she would make you picture somebody in your mind all over again, and she would ask you who knows how many questions all over again, and then tot everything up. She didn&rsquo;t get annoyed with you for pestering her all the time, because she used to receive scented pencil&#8209;erasers from you, coloured glass beads, sweets, and chocolate wafers.<br />
However, the most frequented game was called squares. Inside a square were inscribed a few horizontal lines and two vertical ones. So, there would be a number of rows of three squares each. For one line of squares, you had to say the initials of three boys you really liked. The next row included three favourite colours, the next three favourite cars, then three towns, three countries, three favourite foods, three items of clothing, three drinks, three favourite animals, and the list could go on, depending on how much time and patience the girl playing had (this one was only for the girls). Above the square was placed the number of your future house. According to this magic figure, the numbering would begin and, by exclusion, you were left in the end with you will marry G, you will dress in purple, you will have a Mercedes, you will live in Tokyo, in the country of Holland (well, there could arise mix&#8209;ups because of the numbering), you will have ten children (or none at all), you will eat whipped cream all your life (or mandarins or bananas or chips or aubergine salad), you will dress in furs (or spangled trousers or velvet or hats), you will drink lemonade (or Pepsi or &ldquo;wheeskey&rdquo;) you will have a dog (or a parrot or a fish or a monkey). These games were especially played during breaks, on the blackboard, and anyone could watch. When it was my turn at squares, Harry would be there, but I couldn&rsquo;t include his initial among the three, so I used to put down E. But he knew that, in the whole neighbourhood and in the entire school, there wasn&rsquo;t any Eugene or Emile whom I was thinking about ; he knew that the E had to be the initial of his real name, Erhard. It would always work out the wrong way for me at squares. I never ended up marrying Harry, I would get married to Cãlin, let&rsquo;s say, and I didn&rsquo;t care if I had a Mercedes, that I would eat peanuts, that I would drink Chico or that I would dress in blue lace. I wouldn&rsquo;t care and so I used to break off the game, turn around towards him with a look laden with reproach and go back to my desk, crushed. I used to try to imagine for a moment what my future would be like without him and it would be impossible. Impossible. There was a mad agitation in these games. They would stir up envy. They were grist to the mill of teasing. And the atmosphere was laden with a kind of strange eroticism. It was as if we were all possessed. We were dying of curiosity to see who would end up marrying X or Y. It was all con&shy;tinual spectatorship, insinuation and desperation. These excruciating games, the numbers and the randomness, the sophisticated totting up, the secret and wearisome figures, the mystery of the deciphering, of the interpretations &ndash; they were a tangle which we by no means wanted to name. Grown&#8209;ups called it &ldquo;love&rdquo;, but that wasn&rsquo;t appropriate to us. We ought to have had our own word for all that unreason, for that knot of mixed&#8209;up things, for our senseless, pointless fretting. Then there were the suppositions, the unfounded jealousies, and the absurd competitiveness (we were some twenty girls and only a handful of boys). There were no certainties, but there was a whole heap of hopes, especially when you received trinkets on the first day of spring, when you heard that X had spoken about you to the other boys, when you saw one of them making daring pirouettes in front of you at the skating rink, when you were playing hide and seek and some handsome boy came and crouched in the same place as you, when you received notes during a lesson with questions of the kind, &ldquo;What have we got to write up for grammar tomorrow ?&rdquo;, or when he asked you for some chewing gum, a ruler or whatever, just like that... just so that you would look round towards his desk.<br />
Now, I would be old enough to be the mother of the boy I was in love with twenty years ago. I perfectly remember his mouse&#8209;like face and big ears, his silky, swarthy skin, his tobacco&#8209;coloured hands, with his nails pared down to the skin (which I used to detest in others, but not in him or in Dana), his spotless shirts, with little blue and grey checks, the collars and cuffs fastened with buttons. He even started a fashion at school, and after a week of pestering I too had my mother make a collar and cuffs. Now, it is enough for me to focus and, while all the other thousands of things from the past (and the present) blur and fade away, his face reappears, the face I learned off by heart, the same as you learn a poem by heart, summoning him up before my eyes dozens of times a day, during one period, so as not to forget him &ndash; just as once, when I was little, I had had the cruel revelation of the fact that everything around me would one day disappear and so, on arriving back home, I had &ldquo;learnt&rdquo; mother for ever.<br />
His only fault was that he had a bit of a stupid habit. Whenever it had been raining, when the unpaved street that led to the school filled up with puddles, he would wade with his yellow wellies to where the water looked deepest, wait for me to catch up with him and kick the muddy water to splash me. I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I wasn&rsquo;t flattered by this, although my socks would be all covered in mud. Essentially and in the end, I was privileged, because it was only ever me he felt like splashing. I pretended to get angry and this would give him the opportunity to walk me home apologising, trying to make me laugh so that I would get over it. And then, when it rained again, I would be happy, I would see him from the school gate waiting with his feet in a puddle and, instead of avoiding it, I would pass right by him. I think I would have suffered terribly if he had splashed some one else or if he hadn&rsquo;t splashed me at all. For as long as we sat at the same desk, we never copied from each other, out of pride. I preferred to get a bad mark than to ask him to help me, and he did likewise. Another thing I liked was that he used to score a blue line for a margin in his exercise books, not a red one like all the rest of us. Perhaps this was why I decided that blue was my favourite colour. I also liked the fact that he didn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;musical ear&rdquo; and couldn&rsquo;t sing. I would listen to him hitting the wrong notes in music lessons and I loved his husky voice, always either too high or too low. At school, we were in fierce competition. We were the only ones in our class who both managed to win first prize with a garland. The garland was always of roses, bought from the market, and cost a lot of money. Mine was of daisies ; my dad would make me one every year from flowers he himself picked. Lord, how much I loved my dad, not only because he made me the most beautiful garlands, but also because he was a dab hand at all kinds of other things I could show off at school. He would plait rugs for me out of scrunched&#8209;up paper. He could paint amazingly well, and I would stand next to him and watch how he picked the colours, how he pursed his lips as he concentrated. He would stitch houses and flowers onto cardboard with coloured thread, and for my sake he would always contribute to the class &ldquo;didactic fund.&rdquo;<br />
A garland of daisies keeps for a month. A garland of roses keeps for years, while a rose that fell out of his garland sat in my jewel box for about five years, blackened and papery, and perhaps it might still have been there if someone had not thrown it away.</p>

101 FEM FEM Novel Cartea romaneasca, 2012, 208 pages Cartea romaneasca All rights available <p>&nbsp;Magda Carneci&rsquo;s novel <em>FEM</em> is a volume of visionary prose, a non-conformist foray into the physiological, psychical and metaphysical twists and turns of a generic female character, from tender infancy to early adultness. A contemporary Sheherazade recounts to the lover who has abandoned her the strangest and most intimate experiences of her growth into femininity. A mixture of short story, prose poem, Jungian psychoanalysis, and spiritual confession, FEM aims to be <em>an initiatory text</em>, outside current literary genres, a text about what it means for a human being to open herself up to as yet little-explored and unfamiliar levels of sensibility and understanding. <br />
<em>FEM</em> is a manifestation of the female archetype in the first period of life, an archetype that might give access to surprising possibilities of feeling and understanding. Once known and achieved, these possibilities of being might also manifest themselves on other levels and in subsequent periods of life. FEM is the first stage and will be followed by a further two or three volumes that will go deeper and further explore the trails opened up to now.</p> <p>&nbsp;For quite some time I have been haunted by the image of a huge, an enormous woman. When I am awake, she is visible as a billowy, whitish ghost somewhere behind my eyes, like a vague background for other images from the swarm that continuously flits across my mind&rsquo;s computer monitor. I catch myself noticing fat burly women in parks, shops, or on the street. I gaze at them with sickly, uninhibited insistence. I don&rsquo;t know what it is about them that both attracts and irritates me. A literary sketch came into my mind, about a public transport ticket vendor named Mulberry, who starts to put on weight because her husband has left her, who gets fatter and fatter until she is no longer able to squeeze out of the green metal booth from which she dispenses tram and bus tickets. <br />
In fact, things are not going well for me, because things are not going well with you. Detestable, beloved, hated, loathsome, adorable you. You beast in blue jeans and trainers. You godling in a t-shirt and leather jacket, brimming with lust and fury, with pride and impotence. One evening, grieved by this constant battle with somebody who seems to be from a taxonomic kingdom other than mine, on my way home something happened to me, I had a terrible experience:<br />
I was riding in a bus, which was quite empty for that hour of the evening. There were only a few men and two or three women on the brown plastic seats. I was sitting by myself, with an empty seat next to me. The seats were scuffed and scratched and one of them had even split down the middle, revealing the metal structure beneath. I was going to my mother&rsquo;s, who lives in a housing block in another district. At one stop, a corpulent, or rather obese, woman struggled on board the bus, laden with plastic shopping bags. Her face looked vaguely familiar although it was grossly ordinary and expressionless. All the same, it seemed to me that I had seen here somewhere before. The woman came and sat down next to me. This annoyed me. There were plenty of other empty seats. She could have sat down somewhere else. A sharp surge of irritation suddenly tensed my midriff.</p>
<p><br />
These large, strapping women. These enormous, overbearing women. Not like me. I&rsquo;m scrawny. My mother, for example, comes to mind: a woman wilful and harsh, a kind of female man, an army commander, with arms as vigorous and brawny as two men&rsquo;s put together, who tormented me from an early age with her unbending will to turn me into what she wanted me to be, into what she herself had been unable or not brave enough to be. Then there was our maid, Victoritza, another unstoppable force of nature, with her illegitimate child, fathered by who knows whom and raised in an orphanage, with her drunken tearful outbursts of hysteria, with her heavy palms whenever I made some mistake during the daily rituals of washing, eating, studying, and sleeping and Mother wasn&rsquo;t at home to see her clouting me. <br />
These large, overbearing, dreadful women. Eleonora, for example, my possessive spinster aunt, burly but well-dressed and coiffed, with her overly bleached blonde hair, who insisted on teaching me French and turning me into a &ldquo;lady&rdquo;. Mara, my grandmother&rsquo;s sister, a Catholic nun, who came to live with us when her convent was closed down: as wide as a cupboard and always dressed in her greasy black habit, she used to force me to go to bed in the afternoon and suffocate me with her motherly hugs as she mechanically recited her little prayers. Or the head of my office, that fraying, sour mountain of flesh, with her bombast and bad temper. Anyway, the thought came back to me with a fury there in the bus, next to that woman; a breaker of exasperated, impotent heat crashed over me and I slid sideways into some other place. <br />
It was then that I saw once more the terrible woman who had appeared to me in a dream. A huge, an enormous woman. She was sitting upright in the middle of the world, on a kind of ancient stone stool, and the heavens with their glittering constellations rotated around her. She was naked, she was monstrous, a mound of muscles and wrinkles and folds of fat and flesh, with countless breasts layered like elongated chubby fish scales, like countless bunches of grapes with long, purple nipples, cascading from her broad chest down to her belly. And from beneath that large, rippling belly, from its hidden, shadowy triangle, as if from the majestic portal of a temple, a warm marble portal, there were pouring streams of people, there were entering streams of people, like myriads and myriads of darkly coloured ants. In her lap the woman was holding the world and suckling it from her countless mammary glands, wherefrom flowed streams of milk, but at the same time she almost engulfed and smothered it in her folds of massy fat. She was huge and dark, like a reddish mountain outlined against a purple, distant sky. She was panting and a gurgling sound came from her thick layers of flesh, her folds of fat, and her skin, which was covered with soft colourless down and brown freckles. From time to time she scooped up a handful of people and crammed them into her wide mouth, with its flabby lips, like a blood-red, prone figure of eight. She devoured them insatiably. But down below, countless more people kept emerging from inside her. She was like an infernal meat grinder, like a furnace for melting down rocks and metals, inside which was visible an expanse of blood-red, searing, liquid flesh.</p>
<p><br />
There was something ferocious and unbearable about that image, which fascinated me. Something incomprehensible drew me to that soft, hot body in a dreadful way, that body whose crown seemed to touch the heavens and which filled the world with its sweaty, dark, copious flesh, as the woman sat on her ancient stone stool, her back turned to the glittering constellations traced against the sky around her outline, like a pale aureole. I felt a dreadful attraction. I would have liked to go to her, to press myself against her body. I would have liked to go inside her, to make love with that archaic monster, to die of so much pleasure, like a flea trampled by an elephant, like a mouse flattened by an erupting volcano. And a strong wind ripped me away from the distant place whence I avidly watched the enormous woman, an invincible magnetism thrust me towards her, pressed me against that copious, throbbing flesh and crushed me.  <br />
I am back in the bus. Disgust and fear engendered by the vision of the huge woman linger in my body. I am sweating. My dress is glued to my skin. I cast a sidelong glance at the woman on the seat next to me. A monster, I say to myself yet again, so obese, with her sagging folds of fat, her broad, jowly face, which reminds me of somebody. But who? The woman next to me starts pressing up against me. As if she wanted to get closer, so as not to fall off the seat or to feel protected by me. Or as if she were snuggling up to me or making advances, like a man, vulgar and very definite advances. She presses up against me. She winks at me and her hideous face smiles winsomely, it laughs softly, gurglingly. I huddle up against the wall of the bus until I can withdraw no farther. I feel crushed. I feel revolted, repulsed. An atrocious fear gnaws the lining of my stomach. I want to say something, to shout out, to rebel. I want to attract the attention of the other people in the bus, but a sudden fear and the embarrassment of making a fool of myself obstruct me, strike me dumb. Then I want to stand up, to change seats, to flee. Maybe even to jump from the moving bus, which seems to be going faster and faster and is no longer making the stops. But the fat woman holds me prisoner with her copious body glued dreadfully to mine. Then, with a horrified start, I sense she is sitting on top of me. Like a large, heavy eiderdown. Like an avalanche of dense and strangely hot snow. A black wave washes over me; a stifling warmth descends on me. I sense I am dying and profound terror overwhelms me, strangely mixed with intense pleasure. An enormous, dissolving pleasure.</p>
<p><br />
But in the very instant when I think I am dying, I suddenly realise that the huge woman resembles an enormous Buddha, seated in the lotus position. She is a female Buddha, a huge, pyramidal, golden statue. The head has long woman&rsquo;s hair. The body consists of multiple superposed women, like a tower block with multiple storeys, and these storeys, these levels, each undulate their heads, breasts, bellies. And each head has the same face, repeatedly identically over and over again. And the face, the face is my own face! The idol/monster/goddess, the monstrous Buddha, is I!<br />
And then I rebel, I want to shout, to scream, but all of a sudden I wake up. I am bathed in reeking sweat, a sweat that is simultaneously salty, bitter, sour, and sweet. This smell reminds me of Mother.</p>

102 The Street Strada Novel Ego. Prose series, Polirom, 2012, 248 pages Polirom All rights available <p>Narrated in the first person by the main character, Traian, a boy of eleven, the story centres on the disappearance of his uncle, a mystery around which one of the boy&rsquo;s friends constructs a story involving the uncle being killed by his wife with the help of Traian&rsquo;s mother. He convinces his friends he is right and elaborates on this scenario to a fantastical degree, concocting a convoluted story in which detective fiction interweaves with inventions nurtured by fear, superstition and a belief in ghosts, which reflects the way in which children&rsquo;s minds perceive the incomprehensible world of adults and all its dramas and complications. All this is projected onto a backdrop of touching minor events that recreates a nostalgic picture of childhood in 1980s Romania: going to school, innocent and not so innocent pranks around the housing blocks, conflicts between rival gangs of children, waking up in the morning, standing in queues to buy rationed food, stamp-collecting, watching &ldquo;beat-&rsquo;em-up&rdquo; films on VHS cassettes, feelings of first love, and wakening sexuality. <br />
A novel reminiscent of South Park, a tale brimming with humour, subtle sensibility, and sadness at life&rsquo;s candour and cruelties.</p> <p>and before our Romanian lesson Suzana gave the oracle to a boy from class seven and I felt a lump in my throat because I wanted it too and when she was about to pass me I stood in her way and she asked me what&rsquo;s your name? and I said my name&rsquo;s Traian Rusu but I&rsquo;m not Russian and I wanted to ask her to give me the oracle so I could write in it too and I don&rsquo;t know why but I couldn&rsquo;t because my mouth went all dry each time I tried to ask her for it and she said my name&rsquo;s Suzana and I said I know you&rsquo;re in class seven and you live in the block by the bread shop the same as the Boar and she said yes that&rsquo;s right and I said I was in class five and I was moving up to class six and she said class six is nice and I didn&rsquo;t say anything about the oracle and Suzana went away because Mihut from class eight came up to us and Mihut wants to be with Suzana and Suzana likes him and I went back inside the classroom and I sat down on a chair and I told George I introduced myself to Suzana because he likes her too and after we finished our lessons we waited for Suzana so we could walk her home but Mihut came with us and we went to her block and Mihut said I&rsquo;m going to be a reporter because my dad&rsquo;s a reporter and George said you won&rsquo;t have anything to report on until you grow up and Mihut said yes I will just you wait and see and George said you will only if you interview a bunch of coconuts and I laughed because he&rsquo;d made Mihut look stupid and Mihut asked him have you ever seen a real coconut? and George said no and Mihut said I&rsquo;ve seen one and Suzana laughed and George shut up and I asked Mihut and did you interview it? and George laughed because Mihut looked stupid again and Mihut asked me have you ever seen a real coconut? and I said no because I&rsquo;ve never wanted to and Mihut asked me why have you never wanted to? and I told him to ask someone who&rsquo;s thick and George and I laughed like a hundred devils because Mihut was looking stupid again and Suzana said I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be a great reporter and when we reached the entrance to her block Mihut kissed her on the cheek and George and I said goodbye Suzana and she said goodbye and after that Mihut went away and the two of us walked as far as the Soviet cemetery which is where we parted because George was going to see a friend of his and I crossed the tramline and walked between the blocks until I got to my street and I saw Romeo at the gate of his house and I said hello Romeo and I asked him is there anything wrong? and he said no but it was obvious there was something wrong and I asked him have you caught syphilis? because that&rsquo;s what Cip told us that you can catch it by kissing somebody and you can only get rid of it if you have injections and Romeo said let&rsquo;s go round the back of the house for a bit and I told him hang on I&rsquo;ll just drop off my satchel and then I&rsquo;ll come back and he said bring it with you and I said no wait a bit I&rsquo;ll be right back and I ran home but neither my mother nor sister were there and I left my satchel in the hall I took a piece of cheese from the fridge I stuffed it in my mouth I went outside and I went with Romeo behind the house and Romeo lit a cigarette leaned against a tree and looked at me frowning and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do and I put my hands in my pockets and I waited for him to say something and he asked me what are you playing at? and we both heard my auntie calling him Romeo Romeo and he said we&rsquo;ll talk later and he threw away the cigarette and he was going inside but I followed him and asked what do you mean? and he didn&rsquo;t answer and my auntie&rsquo;s top lip was swollen and when she saw me she covered her mouth with her hand and I looked away and she asked me how is it going at school? and she lowered her hand and smiled at me and I said all right and she asked me would you like some syrup? and I said yes thanks and I followed her into the kitchen and I jumped up on to a stool and she opened the fridge and took out the bottle of syrup and Romeo asked her from the doorway what do you want? and my auntie told him not to use that tone and Romeo asked her again in the same tone and she said I don&rsquo;t want anything and if you&rsquo;ve got something to say and she poured the syrup into my glass and Romeo said I haven&rsquo;t got anything to say and my auntie told him I would have explained it to you myself and Romeo said I don&rsquo;t need you to explain anything to me and she asked him what&rsquo;s wrong with you then? and she turned the tap on and filled the glass and Romeo didn&rsquo;t say anything and so I told my auntie that Romeo had French-kissed a girl and got syphilis and Romeo gave me such a dirty look that I had to turn away and my auntie stirred the syrup in my glass with a teaspoon and handed me it and Romeo said I&rsquo;m off to do my history homework and I said if you don&rsquo;t learn your history you have to repeat the year and Romeo didn&rsquo;t say anything and I said that&rsquo;s what our history teacher told us and Romeo glared at me and went out and I remembered the history teacher I had before who looked like a goat and we used to call him Goatie and I remembered how he used to point at his wristwatch and say it was from Switzerland and one day he didn&rsquo;t come to our history lesson and the headmistress came instead and told us that our history teacher had been beaten up and robbed and when he came back a month or so later he didn&rsquo;t have the wristwatch any more and it was like he wasn&rsquo;t all there and he wasn&rsquo;t the same as he was before and he didn&rsquo;t stay long and he left our school and my auntie didn&rsquo;t say anything and I asked her how is uncle? and she said he&rsquo;s out of town and I asked when is he coming back? and she told me at the end of the week darling and I thanked her for the syrup and I went to Mircea&rsquo;s house and I gave a wolf howl and Mircea came outside and I said I&rsquo;ve got something to tell you and he asked what? and I told him about everything I had found out and he said your auntie killed your uncle and buried him your mother helped her that&rsquo;s why your mother sent you to your auntie&rsquo;s and I was gobsmacked and he said I bet he&rsquo;s buried in your garden and he asked are we detectives? and I said yes we are but my knees were trembling and he said we&rsquo;re going to expose your auntie and we&rsquo;ll get a reward and when my knees stopped trembling he said I know the exact spot where your uncle is buried and I asked where? and he said under the pear tree in your yard that&rsquo;s where and we both ran to see whether it was like he said and Mircea told me to bring a spade and I brought the spade and he started digging and when he got tired he gave me the spade and when I got tired I gave him the spade and we dug until we couldn&rsquo;t dig any more and we sat down on the ground with our feet in the hole and my sister poked her head out of the window and asked what are you doing down there? and I said it&rsquo;s none of your business and she shouted I&rsquo;m going to tell mum what you&rsquo;ve done and I said if you tell her I&rsquo;ll hit you and Mircea said hi Roxana and my sister answered with a phony smile hi Mircea and she slammed the window shut and drew the curtains and Mircea said it&rsquo;s just like I thought all along he&rsquo;s buried in the house and we looked in the house and didn&rsquo;t find anything and Mircea said I don&rsquo;t get it and I said my auntie said that uncle is coming back at the end of the week and Mircea said the dead don&rsquo;t come back and we searched the house once more and in my mother&rsquo;s bedroom he said this floorboard is crooked and so we pulled it up and then we pulled another one up to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t there and before he left he said I&rsquo;m going to think about it and I&rsquo;ll tell you tomorrow and when my mother came and saw what I&rsquo;d done she had a fit and my sister butted in and said to my mother I told him not to do it and I said she&rsquo;s lying mum she didn&rsquo;t tell me and my sister lost her temper and said you&rsquo;re a liar because I did tell you and I said you&rsquo;re the liar because you didn&rsquo;t tell me and my mother asked why did you pull up the floorboards? and I said I was looking for uncle because you and auntie murdered him and buried him in the house or in the yard we don&rsquo;t know where and Mircea and I are going to find him and claim a reward and Roxana laughed so hard she made me hopping mad and I said just you wait and see you liar and she asked see what sucker? and my mother said that&rsquo;s enough stop it Traian fill in that hole and repair the floorboards and as a punishment you&rsquo;re going to dig the soil around all six fruit trees and I filled in the hole and I dug the soil around all six fruit trees in the yard and I repaired the floorboards as best as I could and I ran as fast as lightning to Mircea&rsquo;s house and I made a wolf howl and I waited for him to come outside and he asked what&rsquo;s up? and he said I was eating and I said my mother said that we could look for him wherever we liked except at my house and we&rsquo;re not allowed in the yard any more and Mircea said he&rsquo;s not in your yard he&rsquo;s somewhere else and I asked yes but where? and he said maybe at old man Ilie&rsquo;s because he doesn&rsquo;t see very well hang on I&rsquo;ll be out in a minute and we&rsquo;ll go to his house and I waited till I got bored stiff waiting and then we went to old man Ilie&rsquo;s house and old man Ilie asked us whose children might you be? and I said I&rsquo;m Traian Rusu and my mother&rsquo;s called Maria and Mircea said my name&rsquo;s Mircea Muresan and my mother&rsquo;s called Ileana and old man Ilie said Rusu and Muresan I know you how could I not know you and Mircea asked old man Ilie will you spit up some blood for us? and old man Ilie said yes lad and he hawked up some phlegm and spat out a large clot of blood and we crouched down and Mircea said thanks old man Ilie and he spat but his spit was white and he said look red and white like the Dynamo strip and he laughed like a hundred hens and he said Dynamo are never going to win the championship and I said Red Star is what you put on the Christmas tree and Mircea said they&rsquo;re European champions and I said no they&rsquo;re not they only got that far by accident and old man Ilie asked what is it you want from me lads? and Mircea said we&rsquo;re here because auntie Nuti sent us that&rsquo;s his auntie and he pointed at me so and she said that you could show us what they did in your yard and old man Ilie asked whose yard did you say? and Mircea said in your yard and old man Ilie couldn&rsquo;t remember anything and Mircea asked are you going to let us have a look around? and old man Ilie said look all you like lads look all you like and he opened the gate with his walking stick and we looked and we didn&rsquo;t see anything and the dog was wagging its tail for us to play with him and Mircea went to his kennel and played with him because he really likes dogs and we went out of the yard and Mircea said we didn&rsquo;t find anything old man Ilie and old man Ilie said there was nothing there to find lads the plums won&rsquo;t be ripe until autumn and we went to the entrance of Cip&rsquo;s block and we sat on the steps and Mircea jumped to his feet as if he had ten devils inside him and he said I know where they buried him and I asked where? and he said at old man Barbu&rsquo;s house that&rsquo;s where and I said that&rsquo;s right because old man Barbu is senile and he forgets everything he does and we swear at him and when we pass the same way later he can&rsquo;t remember that we swore at him and we ask him what are you doing old man Barbu? and he answers I was just repairing something but he doesn&rsquo;t curse us this time and he speaks nicely and we went to old man Barbu&rsquo;s house and auntie Carmen was in the yard and I said hello auntie Carmen where&rsquo;s old man Barbu? and she said he&rsquo;s sleeping and Mircea said we want to ask him something to see whether it&rsquo;s true and she said I&rsquo;m not going to wake him up tell me instead and Mircea asked do you know whether old man Barbu buried his uncle? and he pointed at me and auntie Carmen said say that again and Mircea repeated his question do you know whether old man Barbu buried his uncle the other night? and auntie Carmen asked why would Barbu bury Ion? and Mircea didn&rsquo;t answer and I didn&rsquo;t either and auntie Carmen asked us why Ion? and we didn&rsquo;t say anything and auntie Carmen asked bury him where? and Mircea said here in the yard and auntie Carmen looked at us and her mouth was gaping open and we could see her gold teeth which looked like glow-worms and she made the sign of the cross and said that we shouldn&rsquo;t wish other people dead and that we should leave her father alone because he&rsquo;s in a sorry enough state as it is and we left and Mircea said old man Barbu is a good man that&rsquo;s what people ought to be like they shouldn&rsquo;t hold grudges but auntie Carmen is like the devil and he took a notebook and a pen from his pocket and he started to write something and I asked him what are you writing? and he said I&rsquo;m writing down clues and information and I asked what have we found out up to now? and he said I&rsquo;ve eliminated two theories and I said aha aha and he said they didn&rsquo;t bury him at old man Barbu&rsquo;s house because auntie Carmen is too much of a devil to have let them and it wasn&rsquo;t at old man Ilie&rsquo;s house and we went to the entrance of Cip&rsquo;s block but there wasn&rsquo;t anybody there and Mircea said they&rsquo;ve gone off somewhere around the neighbourhood and I said let&rsquo;s go find them and he said no I&rsquo;m going home and I said all right then I&rsquo;m going home too because I didn&rsquo;t feel like searching the neighbourhood for them on my own and we parted ways and Mircea called after me Traian and I shouted back yes and he said I know where they buried your uncle and I asked where? and he shouted I&rsquo;ll tell you tomorrow bye and when I got back home my mother started nagging me about whether I&rsquo;d done my homework and I said I&rsquo;m going to do it now and I asked where&rsquo;s Roxana? and she said she&rsquo;s at Madalina&rsquo;s and she asked are you hungry? and I said yes and she said well then wash your hands and come to the table</p>

103 Minoan Minoic Novel Fiction LTD series, Polirom, 2011,  696 pages Polirom All rights available <p>&nbsp;At the centre of this intellectual thriller, which fuses the real and the virtual in an alternative interpretation of Romanian history from the inter-war period to the present day, is a paradoxical book: although it promises the secret of eternal love, its pages are impregnated with a fast-acting poison. Brought from Java to Romania as part of a plot to assassinate King Carol II, the book passes down through the decades, becoming the focal point of various strange conflicting interests: from the Legionary Movement (the far-right mystic revolutionaries of 1930s Romania) to Cold War secret services, American academics with esoteric obsessions, and treasure hunters from post-communist Romania in search of Ceausescu&rsquo;s secret bank accounts.</p>
<p><br />
The plot unfolds on two temporal and geographical levels. In the present (the 1990s), Nicu Stoica, a poet from Bucharest, visits the fictional American city of Shebango at the invitation of his friend Dinu Dima. A longtime &eacute;migr&eacute; to the United States, Dima is the curator of the book collection left to Shebango University by late celebrity professor Tidid Diomed Caraiani, who was of Romanian origin. Except that Dima strangely does not turn up, leaving Nicu, a character as if out of a Woody Allen film, to wander through a world he cannot understand, guided only by mysterious messages in the &ldquo;Minoan&rdquo; alphabet that the two friends invented together as students and which is intelligible only to them.</p>
<p><br />
The second level is set in the Romania of the 1930s and focuses on three friends, the Macedonian-Romanian T. D. Cariani, the Jewish Puiu Leibovici, and the Armenian Kevork Lapsarian. It is Lapsarian who tells the story of three lives that are at first bound together in friendship before being dramatically sundered. As a refugee in Palestine, Puiu gets involved in paramilitary Zionist organisations and after remaining crippled becomes a famous mystic philosopher. Cariani, after a journey to Java (it is he who brings the famous poison book to Romania and long thereafter recovers it for his personal library) becomes a teacher at Shebango University. After studying philosophy in Germany, Kevork returns to Romania, where he is imprisoned in communist labour camps and later becomes a factory worker. <br />
Unfinished stories and the passions impact upon the present and finding the poison book once more becomes a matter of life and death. The solution to shadowy mysteries connected to the history of Romanian fascism and communist totalitarianism comes to depend solely on the confused and bumbling Nicu Stoica. Armed only with his knowledge of the &ldquo;Minoan&rdquo; alphabet, he is drawn into a desperate struggle not only to find his missing friend, but also to save the lives of his wife and children left behind in Romania.</p> <p>&nbsp;The meeting was held in secret at a cottage in the open-air Museum of the Romanian Village, which the disciples of Gusti were working on in those days. Obviously, the people who enabled such secret and illegal gatherings were those among the nation&rsquo;s young sociologists who nurtured fervent Legionary beliefs and sincere admiration for the Captain. We went in a group of around twelve, boys and girls, and there we discovered the Great Inspirer. When we arrived, he was sitting on a tree stump with his back to us, busy doing something. When we came closer, we saw that he was cracking walnuts. He seems to have liked walnuts a great deal. Or else they held some spiritual meaning for him. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, he had planted a number of walnut trees in the countryside, which then became objects of veneration. But maybe I&rsquo;m mistaken. You see, on the subject of the Legion and its armed wing, the Iron Guard, I have never done any systematic research. Obviously, under communism I didn&rsquo;t have access to any reliable sources. But in general, after all the beatings meted out to me in Securitate basements, and after all the declarations in which I was made to inculpate myself to such an extent that you would have thought I was second only to the Iron Guard&rsquo;s Nicadori and Decemviri death squads, I&rsquo;ve come to realise that I can no longer tell fact from fiction.</p>
<p><br />
[...]<br />
In spite of all that, I can assure you that I did meet the Captain that evening. In the faint, flickering light his face looked like wax: long, bony, so white and so cleanly shaven that it acquired chimeric, hieratic hues. Like wax? When I saw him with my own eyes, I think that this is what went through my mind. But now, as I describe him, I would sooner say like porcelain. There was something feminine, vulnerable about it. His large eyes suggested a kind of innocence. How can I put it? An impenetrable, decisive innocence, which had taken cognisance of the world&rsquo;s infinite abjection, which knew how far pain and suffering could go, but which remained, in a distinct, unmistakable way, innocence. <br />
It is hard to believe that he was playacting, although nonetheless the harmony between the embroidered peasant jerkin he wore casually draped over his shoulders and his Gary Cooper-style quiff was somehow too studied. No, he was not playacting; he was theatricality itself. A permanent performance. He was an ornament that contained and manifested nothing except the principle of its own distillation. A strange being, who gave you the impression that he somehow existed in two dimensions. Although he was the source of all the Orthodox exaltation whose ferment we witnessed, fascinated or impotent, for many years, he did not resemble a Byzantine figure in any way, but rather a Gothic design, awkwardly hieratic, subtly disproportional. <br />
The maieutics that unfolded around that rustic table in front of that peasant house carefully recreated by specialists resided in simple questions, which the Captain put to each of us individually. It was obvious that he did not expect conversation from any of us, and less so debate, God forbid. The Captain was known for his visceral horror of doubts. He wanted only to make us feel what he himself named the &ldquo;unquenchable power of the open soul, the mystery of brotherly faith and love.&rdquo; One word he liked very much, and one of the few neologisms he tolerated in his archaic, consistently rustic and churchy vocabulary, was &ldquo;normality&rdquo;.  <br />
As we sat around the table, taking our communion of cheese and breaking bread, which I am inclined to believe was made from potato flour, in the German fashion, Puiu all of a sudden leapt to his feet, like a bright tracer bullet against the night sky. He had probably been preparing to take the limelight for a long while. But even in his case I can&rsquo;t say how much comedy and how much sincere pathos there was in the tirade we witnessed. <br />
Of what did Puiu speak to the Captain? It was a kind of fervent plea, but one that boiled coldly, to use an expression from the time. It was like a whirlwind of thorns, if I can put it like that. Obviously, I cannot reproduce it in every detail. But the gist was that anti-Semitism was a terrible mistake, both spiritually and tactically. Why should the Movement let itself be drawn into the excesses of a race that had excess in its very bloodstream? Why should they imitate the Germans in their brutal and indiscriminate hatred of the Jews? Why not follow the example of their Latin brothers? For, in Italy, Mussolini was not an anti-Semite and the Fascists were open, or at least had been for a long time, to all political young men who proven capable of the passion and the will to transform themselves and the world around them. <br />
It was as if the moon privileged our table with a stream of its rays. There was a kind of pallor on every face. The Captain was flabbergasted, unable to chew the inadvertently large piece of cheese he had placed in his mouth, probably forgetting that it was already full of walnuts. Almost without pausing for breath Puiu went on, explaining that through acceptance and openness the Movement would not abandon its Christian essence, as had been the case in Italy. Of course, to human logic, it might appear that there could be no reconciliation between Christians and Jews, theologically speaking. But herein reside true strength, uniqueness, and novelty: in acknowledgement of paradox as a wellspring of energy and action. Because only God, in His unbounded providence, can accept both the one and the other, and He probably wants us to be at odds, incapable of understanding or accepting each other, without our ever being able to come together, but also without our ever being able to part. Which means that He wishes us to remain like this, with our souls open to paradox and uncertainty. Let us understand that above and beyond our theologies only He can dispense mercy and salvation. And if this be so, then here, in Romania, the Legion might become the first movement in history to draw its strength from weakness, to unleash the extraordinary forces of sincere self-doubt. Think, said Puiu, of all those Patriarchs of Constantinople, who believed in the birth of a Greco-Ottoman Empire, in which Orthodoxy and Islam might reside together within a process of mutual tension, destined in fact to maintain the life of the spirit, and within the same urge toward greatness, toward the political sublime.</p>
<p><br />
[...]<br />
The young men and women had had come there with me barely dared to breathe. As for us, Titi and myself, I mean, our hearts froze. We were expecting to be thrown out and have our backsides kicked, or to be mercilessly torn apart. For, we were known to be friends of Puiu&rsquo;s, and so his heretical ideas would also have been automatically imputed to us. But miraculously, nothing happened. The Captain did not so much as raise an eyebrow; he did not suddenly twitch his shoulders, beneath the peasant jerkin, to signal his invisible praetorian guards to intervene. In effect, nothing happened. He remained motionless, staring into space, in a kind of dreamy puzzlement. As if he had fallen asleep with his eyes open. You might have supposed that Puiu had managed to hypnotise him, or that the Captain&rsquo;s mind was merely elsewhere. That absorbed in the country&rsquo;s problems he had simply not been paying attention to anything that Puiu had been saying. <br />
[...]<br />
Titi flew into a rage. For the first time in my life I realised that &ldquo;to foam at the mouth with rage&rdquo; is more than a metaphor. Titi was literally foaming. He was incapable of articulating a word without his mouth contorting. Maybe he was battling forces even greater than the ones he allowed to come crashing and thundering down on us. His eyes flashed strangely, but at the same time they wandered, unable to focus on anything. <br />
At first I thought that he was merely giving vent to the terror we had all been feeling. I got the impression that he was cursing and vituperating the individuals into whose midst we had crept. But once my ears grew accustomed to the pitch and the disjointedness of his shouts, I understood that the object of his rage was Puiu. How could he do such a thing? Why had he not been able to judge the moment? How had he been incapable of understanding what was going on there? Titi seemed convinced that the Captain&rsquo;s personality had something diffusive about it, that it had to be studied with patience and understood. &ldquo;It is clear,&rdquo; he all but yelled, &ldquo;that everything the Yid press churns out about this man is filth and slander.&rdquo; Yes, those were his very words, &ldquo;the Yid press.&rdquo; The words were probably deliberate, aimed at hurting Puiu. &ldquo;The Movement is he, this is clear, not the rabble of semi-illiterates and superstitious, unwashed yokels who have become medical students overnight,&rdquo; thundered Titi. <br />
The idea that emerged from that seemingly endless tirade was that we had missed the opportunity genuinely to understand the great man.</p>
<p><br />
[...]<br />
Puiu and I were left dumbstruck. We walked together a little further and then each went our separate ways, in bewilderment, like sleepwalkers. Later, I was sorry to have missed my sole opportunity of asking him whether he had spoken in earnest there at the table of the Captain, or whether he had been attempting to take our game of pretending to be fanatics to new heights, whether he had prepared his speech long in advance, whether he had weighed up its impact, or whether it had been an inspired outburst. All that I can suppose is that it was the eruption to the surface of the massive sediments left by his readings of Kierkegaard, Martin Buber and the man who was to become my idol and teacher, Professor Himmelbeer. <br />
Later, however, for as long as the two of us were in contact, I never broached the subject. Never. In any case, immediately thereafter, Puiu disappeared from view. He did not answer the telephone and in the end, without any transition, without any interlude or scene of parting, he went to England with his family. It was not until he had settled in and had become a student at the London School of Economics that he sent me a letter. I was in Bergberg by then. Puiu had managed to contact my parents and they had given him my new address. In his letter he mentioned nothing of our parting that night and in the most natural tone he even asked for news of Titi. <br />
I answered, informing him of the latest developments: Titi&rsquo;s departure to Java. But I told him nothing about what had really happened prior to that, meaning what happened when Titi and I had gone back to the Legionary den. I might say that Titi forced me to go back, but I would be lying. Our game of pretending to be Legionaries had grown to be a habit with me. It was hard for me to break with all those social acquaintances. But I went back with a tense heart, because I knew that the blackest suspicions were hovering over our heads, as comrades and known friends of Puiu, who must have raised a storm of resentment in his wake, of that we had no doubt. <br />
And we were not mistaken. As soon as he set eyes on us, the head of the den began to process us, as the communists were later wont to say, referring to interrogation. He told us that we had aroused the ire of the entire Movement and that, unfortunately for us, the Captain had in the meantime been informed by unassailable sources of the fact that we had introduced a &ldquo;son of Mammon&rdquo; into the ranks of students of &ldquo;pure Romanian sentiment.&rdquo; In such circumstances, we could only remain in the Movement if we agreed to make a confession in front of all the other comrades, to open up our souls, to repent, and to accept whatever penance the Captain himself would impose upon us.</p>
<p><br />
[...]<br />
Although I am now embarrassed to admit it, at the time I had no particular objection to that. You know, in those days, talk of Judeo-Masonic plots was like background music. Maybe you will be able to get some idea of it if you&rsquo;re familiar with the mood that prevailed later, when people chanted slogans written down for them by the communist unions. After they allowed me to become a welder, I was often given the special honour of carrying the flag at the May Day parade. But for now, we are talking about a different epoch: we are bathed in the crackling light of torches (they don&rsquo;t make torches like they used to) and my friend Titi has just finished giving his speech about the age-old enemy of the Romanian people, resolutely denouncing our friend Puiu. He didn&rsquo;t demand that he be condemned to death or anything like that, God forbid. But given the tension that was in the air&hellip;<br />
It was as if Titi had taken leave of his senses. I could see him sweating, losing his thread, coming out with nonsense about how we had been misled by means of various contrivances, but in no case money, no, we had not sullied ourselves with anything like that, our intentions had been good, idealistic. Puiu had managed to pull the wool over our eyes with his perverse sophistry; he had caused us to grow distant from what the voice of our blood ought to have told us about solidarity with our true brothers, the Movement&rsquo;s martyrs.</p>
<p><br />
[...]<br />
Anyway, the most dramatic moment was when they made him spit. Yes, yes, they made him spit. You see, in the torchlight, next to the makeshift rostrum for our public confession, there was a drawing. A typical caricature, of the sort to be found everywhere in those days: a hook-nosed Jew with sensual lips and clawing hands&hellip; No, no, such caricatures had never bothered me before. They seemed in the natural way of things. But at the time I realised that this was not the image of a generic Jew, but the face of our friend Puiu, grotesquely distorted by hatred. It struck me like an electric shock. It was Puiu! To prove we were worthy of remaining in the ranks, blah, blah, blah, we had to be willing to spit on him and defile his likeness.</p>
<p><br />
[...]<br />
I realised that they were going to make me defile poor Puiu, to renounce him, to say all those vile things. And it horrified me. I suddenly felt a void gape deep inside me, rending my innards, the same void I was later to feel during the Malmaison investigations and in the basements of the Securitate at Ploiesti, when they forced me to say all kinds of aberrant things about different people. [...] And then my cousin Krikor came to my aid. Krikor was a few years older than me. He was taller and had a broad chest. He died in a car accident at the age of thirty-two. Well, I spent the holidays with his family in Braila when I was eleven and he was fifteen, and Krikor had amused himself by teaching me to imitate his father&rsquo;s brother, who lived with them, our uncle Avetik, having one of his fits of le grand mal. Yes, that&rsquo;s right, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about. He was epileptic, the poor man. <br />
Yes, you&rsquo;re right. The innocent cruelty of children. An episode of which in the meantime I had come to be ashamed, an episode I had tried to conceal in the remotest recesses of my memory, in those special safe-deposit boxes for memories that put me in a sordid light, crannies which back then were not nearly as full as they are today. But in that instant the memory spurted into my mind with great clarity, almost causing me to faint. And before I could think about it or reach any conscious decision, I found myself thrashing around on the floor, croaking, rolling my eyes, and foaming at the mouth. It seems that everything I had practised with Krikor for days at a time had been stored in the cells of my body. Rather like riding a bicycle again for the first time in years and years.</p>

104 Rejected Se respinge Novel Cartea romaneasca, 2011, 448 pages Cartea romaneasca All rights available <p>The year is 1990. Departing from the Gara de Nord in Bucharest, a young man arrives in S&ouml;dert&auml;lje twenty-four hours later, having made three train journeys and two ferry crossings. An intellectual familiar with Dostoevsky, M&aacute;rquez, O&rsquo;Neill, Fellini, Bergman and Bu&ntilde;uel, it is the first time he has travelled farther than Romania&rsquo;s western frontier, and now here he is alighting in a train station whose name has umlauts on two different vowels! And so the adventure begins. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;It is a Swedish novel, conceived and written in Romanian. Some characters wander the seafront of Stockholm and the cobbled streets of Uppsala, their minds on the chaos in Bucharest and the tank parked in front of the Romanian Academy, on the whims of the Bucharest newspapers, on the oil derricks of Dragasani, on the latest theatre productions in Craiova, on the university halls of residence in Cluj, and on the studio of Student Radio. Others dream of the dust of Algeria, the mountains of Kurdistan, and white nights in Leningrad. They are the<em> immigrants</em>. Romanians, but not only and not necessarily: to the Swedish authorities they are asylum seekers, cases, files; to Amnesty International and lawyers, they are victims, although many of them are set on possessing such a status. For the fair-haired Nordic majority of the 60th parallel, they are an unknown factor: exotic, promising, but also threatening. My novel is the story of such people. Harrowing, in places tragic, in places comic, as well as tragic-comic, it is also the story of their struggle to obtain a VISA.&rdquo; (Radu J&ouml;rgensen)</p> <p>&nbsp;That winter the deafening noise of tank tracks along the central boulevard, the machinegun fire whose tracers whizzed above our block in the middle of the night, and all the tragic atmosphere of a European Beirut had helped me to break away from the past in a single bound. Unthinkingly, I treated all the people who did not later place themselves in power (in every revolution there are people who hijack its meaning and place themselves in power) as being &ldquo;on my side&rdquo;, in the same camp. [&hellip;]<br />
The blue-green train I had taken from Stockholm was now stopping at unfamiliar stations, all of them announced over the speakers at short intervals. [&hellip;]<br />
The offices of <em>The Intellectua</em>l and the headquarters of the group that went by the same name &ndash; whose platform of social dialogue had been drawn up on the last day of 1989 in the lobby of an Intercontinental Hotel lit and heated only by candles &ndash; were both located in the same building. [&hellip;] A stylish boyar period building, rather like a manor house in the middle of the capital, one of the hundreds of houses that had thitherto been hidden from the gaze of passers-by behind tall fences guarded by goons in blue uniforms with pistols at their hips, menacingly whacking rubber truncheons in their palms, and by sentry boxes with tinted glass. A free dialogue between intellectuals and society, the masses, is what they decided upon at the time, to the sound of the machinegun fire outside. And in the candlelight their faces glowed with happiness. A dialogue of intellectuals on genuinely social topics, an increased propensity for dialogue on the part of society, reaching as far as its unlikeliest strata. [&hellip;]<br />
I entered and said I knew how to write and wished to write. <br />
<br />
<br />
And I wrote. I wrote about them, the new regime, for a time. I was there when the few in number held to an extreme conservatism, and well that they did, so I told myself. [&hellip;] The conjoined words &ldquo;civil society&rdquo; went from mouth to mouth and how pleasing they were to every one of us! They imposed a drastic selectiveness on membership of our close-knit group (that January, when the first snowfall covered the blood stains on the cobblestones, there must have been twenty of us in all). Obviously, to be a member they demanded you have a different kind of background file than the one required by the Communist Party. [&hellip;] They didn&rsquo;t demand a file with cardboard covers and a rusty metal runner, but it still amounted to information about your past, the past of each person that tried to gain ingress to the group. And well that they did, so I thought. In spite of their three, eight or twenty-two published books (and those who had published the most had been the masters of compromise prior to that bloody winter), all aspiring members were viewed with great reserve, as if by a new Securitate. After all, <em>The Intellectual</em> had every right to have its own watchdog; at least it had something to defend. It did not invent merits for itself. It existed and wished to guard itself against being sullied. The group kept any intruder at a distance. The purity of that movement seemed beautiful to me. And even if I was only a foot soldier armed with a fountain pen and a notebook, ready to chase after news stories for them day and night, to write, to take interviews, to proofread their texts dozens of times, the feeling I experienced alongside them was, in the beginning, exalted. [&hellip;]<br />
The editor-in-chief of <em>The Intellectual</em> was a burly, bearded man, a kind of Danubian Castro, who (also) resembled the Cuban when it came to his tumultuousness, his vital energy; he was the kind of editor who demanded strict control over all the material that ended up on the page. That Castro took me to heart. I&rsquo;ve no idea why. And he did me ill thereby. For a while, I did secretarial work, trying to swallow my pride and telling myself that any kind of work was good in the presence of such men. It was better than having my name appear on the masthead of some old newspaper that had been renamed and which to legitimise itself needed a few young (post-)revolutionaries in its cesspit of corrupt timeservers. [&hellip;] It was preferable to accept for the time being the dubious status of a job on the editorial staff of <em>The Intellectual</em>. <br />
But I couldn&rsquo;t go on closing my eyes to it all forever. The more its articles originated from the upper echelons of Europe&rsquo;s revolutionary intellectuals, the more arid the magazine&rsquo;s articles became. True, there were figures that had to be introduced to East-European readers who had been kept in the dark for a very long time. But the texts themselves, even if they were representative of their authors, and this was something I was beginning to doubt, were pushing the magazine further and further away from the idea of &ldquo;social dialogue.&rdquo; [&hellip;] For a while I preferred to deceive myself, keeping faith with the magazine&rsquo;s attitude. But then the doubt began to resurface. <br />
One evening, I was reading some proofs, happy at having had my second article published in the magazine in the company of so many prestigious names. It was cold in the boyar palace, in the large, high-ceilinged rooms, which seemed very tall to all of us, who came from eighth-floor bedsits and mansards with sloping roofs. The walls of the ballrooms dazzled me with their phosphorescent whiteness, the old-fashioned furniture made me feel tense, and I could barely open the solid-wood doors with their gold appliqu&eacute;s, so heavy were they. The red velvet armchairs and long meeting tables, at the ends of which lords had once sat facing each other at breakfast, but at which in the last forty years the comrades had held their meetings on how to bury us, were covered in hoarfrost due to the unwonted cold inside the building. God had been on the side of the children, I thought, on the side of those who that December had taken to the streets wearing only shirts and light jackets as they faced the tanks. It had been a warm December. But now God had started to lose patience with us, those who had begun to forget the sacrificed lives and were now caught up willy-nilly in the game of the reinstalled communists. Even if they were caught up in that game only as peaceful opponents. Around the tables in the meeting rooms, the members of the group were wearing mittens and were smiling icily. After all, at the time the great thaw had barely begun. <br />
<br />
<br />
That evening Castro came up to the editorial office from the kitchen, munching on a huge schnitzel and holding a mug of hot tea in his left hand. He sat down without paying any attention to me: I was in his office, as it was the only one that was habitable, given its two radiators. A creature always pallid, with a smile that had pretensions to concealing thousands of hidden meanings, the editorial secretary (a great dissident, so I had been told) suddenly entered and displaying the said enigmatic smile tossed an article on Castro&rsquo;s desk. It was an article that he had passed &ndash; that had passed the censorship he had put in place &ndash; and was to be printed the very next day. Yes, Castro knew about it, he knew about it, and had specially allowed it. &ldquo;Let him break his own neck,&rdquo; he added. <br />
Where is he supposed to break his neck, I wondered, in a magazine where there wasn&rsquo;t room to publish even three lines among all the illustrious contributors, the winners of peace prizes, the Nobels and the Goncourts, the experts in human rights, the exiled philosophers, and the intellectuals who had been political prisoners? And then Castro went out in order to write up his editorial on the electronic typewriter &ldquo;donated to us by Mr Genscher,&rdquo; as he proudly used to put it. I picked up the article from the table and read it. [&hellip;] I couldn&rsquo;t understand how the author would be breaking his own neck by publishing it. Above all I was intrigued at why a man that the <em>Intellectual</em> group published on a weekly basis and eagerly courted should have to break his own neck. [&hellip;] The article had a broad democratic viewpoint and was one of the best I had read. <br />
I didn&rsquo;t know at the time and nor do I know today how he could &ldquo;break his own neck,&rdquo; but break it he did, for it was the last article he published. Either the members of the group had understood it differently or it had been &ldquo;presented&rdquo; to them differently. Afterwards, I saw him at the newspaper office a few times, increasingly humble, increasingly stooped. The first time was one week later, when I was present at his meeting with Castro. After deliberately having made him wait in the antechamber for a long while, Castro had come out of his office, as if in passing, to collect from the hall the letters and the magazines that daily arrived from all over the world. Without shaking his hand, although the little old man had politely risen from his chair, Castro had scolded him with a wagging finger, as if he were a pupil whose parents had been summoned to school:<br />
&ldquo;Have you any idea what you have done? Enough is enough. We&rsquo;re through. Collect the money for your articles to date and get out.&rdquo;<br />
Then Castro vanished back into his office. As the little old man was looking in bewilderment now at me, now at the secretary, the head of <em>The Intellectual </em>stuck his head around the door of his office and added demonstratively:<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be disturbed. I&rsquo;m going to be on the phone to Prague.&rdquo; And then to the old contributor, heightening the already embarrassing atmosphere, he added a monosyllabic &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; as if he were asking a child finally to admit that he had made a mistake and never to ask to sit at the same table as the grown-ups again.  <br />
I was struck not so much by the fear of the article-writer or that final demonstration of cheap theatricality on Castro&rsquo;s part, in his role of disappointed benefactor, as much as the fact that a microbe, a virus had infiltrated the machinery which the intellectuals of the group, the uncompromised elite, had conceived.  <br />

105 Red Shift Deplasarea spre rosu Novel Fiction LTD series, Polirom, 2012, 312 pages Polirom All rights available <p><em>Red Shift</em> is an epistolary novel consisting of a long letter in which the narrator addresses his son, who is in Germany with his mother, the narrator&rsquo;s ex-wife. Within this elaborate and, as the letter-writer himself admits, &ldquo;literary&rdquo; missive, the narrator&rsquo;s identity is gradually revealed to us (he is Romi, formerly a French teacher and now a journalist in a town in Transylvania, a lonely, drifting alcoholic), as well as the reasons why the &ldquo;writer&rdquo; has ended up in his present state, although we do not find out the most important reason until the final pages of the book. The novel is structured like a nest of boxes. The frame story, Romi&rsquo;s long confessional letter to his son, contains the story of the narrator&rsquo;s encounter with an Englishwoman named Diana, who has come to Romania with an aid convoy for a centre for handicapped children. She is a young woman, but it is as if she is trying to conceal her youth (she certainly doesn&rsquo;t take any advantage of it). She is taciturn, but nevertheless, one night, after copious amounts of cheap Romanian vodka (the same vodka as the narrator drinks night after night), she reveals her own story. Romi answers her story with one of his own, about how he met Grete Tamas, a beautiful violinist haunted by nightmares, who later became his wife and then, as a result of that marriage, the mother of the letter&rsquo;s addressee. The ending, when we finally discover the reason for the narrator&rsquo;s present solitude, is surprising. Grete&rsquo;s brother Hans, who had fled to Germany in the communist period, invites the narrator and his family to spend two weeks with him after the revolution. The siblings harbour a terrible secret, which is accidentally revealed to the narrator. Shocked, he takes the irrevocable decision to break off all contact with the brother and sister, but thereby loses contact with his son, who, we intuit, has now reached an age when he is mature enough to read and understand his father&rsquo;s long letter.</p> <p>&nbsp;The orphanage where I was to meet Alin Sirbu was about twenty kilometres from town, on a hill at the edge of a village. I was familiar with a number of such ancient buildings, which you found scattered throughout Transylvania: some were rustic castles, others the remains of fortifications that had been converted into offices, warehouses, or workshops after the war. Too large and too old to be maintained properly, they had been in ruins for years and were beginning to be abandoned. In the description Alin Sirbu gave me when he arranged our meeting he provided me with some familiar landmarks, but I had passed through the area many times and so I recognised the place easily, as soon as I left the village. The large iron gates, facing onto the main road, were wide open. One of them was hanging askew. Behind the wall enclosing the estate, the dense vegetation of a wild garden was visible. <br />
To give you a better idea, it was like a visit to an enchanted castle, a visit decided upon by a madman in a short interval of lucidity. The madman was I, at the wheel of my car, and the madness was the opaque screen that was there, every evening, when I returned to my third-floor den. This respite occurred on a September afternoon whose atmosphere was like acacia honey. <br />
We hadn&rsquo;t set any particular time for our meeting and so I had no reason to hurry. I drove through the gates at a walking pace. The cobbled lane led up a gentle slope and at that hour of the afternoon it was deserted. In the distance loomed the round watchtower with its conical roof and the rear wall of the building, a white patch in the dense, tangled greenery. I think that at this point I permitted myself a few moments of romantic dreaminess. It was still a long time until the first hoarfrosts, and even longer still until the first snows, and a somnolent, holiday atmosphere still lingered, a remnant of the dry summer that swathed in golden mists the villages of the uplands as far as the mountains, as well as the city whence I had set out in mellow sympathy with the season. Usually, the onset of evening would quicken my pulse, but until then I still had a respite of calm and, with a pang of regret, it crossed my mind that I ought to have taken advantage of such moments in the past. In that afternoon reverie I imagined that it had been somebody else who had been deciding what I should do and I took the occasion to rebuke that person for ruining my calendar and letting me waste so many days.</p>
<p><br />
I suddenly had the impression that something, a body, had fallen out of a tree at the edge of the lane directly in front of the car, but if I had had the strength to judge normally I would have realised that the distance was too great. In any case, it had fallen with the litheness of a cat. When I found myself with that something a hand&rsquo;s breadth or less than a hand&rsquo;s breadth away from the front of the car, it was already too late to do anything. All of a sudden, in that very instant, the skin beneath my shirt became soaked in a cold sweat. <br />
Everything happened almost simultaneously after that. First came the impact, travelling like an electric shock through the steering wheel and into the pit of my stomach. Nevertheless, I was in first gear and moving without acceleration. Although paralysed with fear, I braked by reflex and still managed to realise that the engine had stalled. What I did see in front of me, all too well, was the head, a hand&rsquo;s breadth above the end of the bonnet, and the two raised arms. The impact had come only a moment before, a dull thud, after which the body rolled towards me and came to a stop on the windscreen. And there was something else: the incredible grimace of the malicious or mocking laugh, in which, and of this I am sure, there was no trace of fear or pain. And then there was silence, the motor was dead, and in the blink of an eye the car was surrounded on all sides by dozens of children. <br />
With the still inert body on the bonnet, my reaction probably seemed comical. I shouted something and forgetting to unfasten my seat belt I tried to open the door and get out of the car. I was unable to do so. I could feel the dozens of children pushing up against the car to prevent my egress. The truth is the shock had driven me insane, as I was later to realise to my shame. I remained frozen, helpless in my seat, gazing fatuously ahead of me, while a hundred or more eyes looked at me like a fish in an aquarium. <br />
I am certain that they had seen me as soon as I entered the lane. They must have been lying in wait, hidden in the bushes, not far off, if they had managed to surround me on all sides before I knew what was happening. They had burst out behind me, all of them with the same incredible swiftness of small creatures too fleet for the eye to follow. There were very many of them and they were all wearing yellow tracksuits with a black Mickey Mouse printed on a patch on the breast pocket. As far as I was aware, the older ones were standing further back, in reserve, like referees, and the more aggressive and raucous ones, with their bellicose cries, were the smallest children. These were the most numerous. I espied some of them in the rear-view mirror, running up to the car after being left behind, but I had the impression that a number of others had jumped out of the trees at the edge of the lane. <br />
Most of them were crowded up against the driver&rsquo;s door and on checking I verified my impression that they were deliberately preventing me from getting out of the car. Others were trying desperately to open the passenger door, which was locked from the inside, and they were making a menacing, pantomime show of ripping it from its hinges. This probably lasted no more than a minute. During this time, others, clambering on top of each other on the bonnet, were peering at me through the windscreen in curiosity. <br />
It was strange: in fact, they were screaming and laughing. It took a little while before I realised this. They had taken me prisoner and they knew that I was utterly defenceless. Without my seeing how they did it, one or two of them had managed to clamber up the back of the car onto the roof and I could hear the muffled thuds of their feet above my head. I think that this is what brought me back to my senses. I shook my fist at the ones on the bonnet:<br />
&ldquo;Get down off there!&rdquo;<br />
After that I started the engine and gave a long, angry toot on the horn, although I didn&rsquo;t have the courage to drive away, given all the bodies pressing up against the car. The one I had hit with the car had recovered or was pretending that he had recovered and this gave me a little courage. I think that it was then that I discovered he was laughing. There were another two, just as small, on top of him, almost crushing him, and they were clinging to the windscreen wipers. The others were laughing along with him, as if at a highly successful prank&hellip; <br />
&ldquo;It means they like you,&rdquo; Alin Sirbu explained to me, laughing, having come to greet me after hearing the car horn. &ldquo;I think they liked both you and the car, fifty-fifty. When people come here and they don&rsquo;t like them, they pretend not to see them. Believe it or not, I&rsquo;m one of the ones they don&rsquo;t like. What do you say to that? Not to like me, who came dressed up as Father Christmas! When they see me arriving in my car, if I find them on the road, they turn their backs. I haven&rsquo;t deciphered the message yet, but it&rsquo;s obvious I inspire them as being something evil, like a wizard in a fairytale or an ogre&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
As if by magic the children had indeed vanished as we walked side by side down the now deserted lane. Alin Sarbu was amused by my plight. His arrogant smile, which would have annoyed me at any other time, gave the impression that he viewed my mishap as being of no importance. Could his mere arrival have put the army of children to flight? I was inclined not to believe it. But what I thought then is of no significance, at least not yet. &ldquo;Lock it and leave it here,&rdquo; he advised, assuring me that my car was not in the way and that nobody would interfere with it. I did as he said. In the end, I ought to have laughed, but I no longer felt like it. <br />
As I told you, evening was approaching, but the oppressive heat of a dry summer in its death throes still lingered. This was why I was wearing a t-shirt and sandals on my bare feet. Vaguely out of sorts, I could not help but notice that on this point, too, Alin Sarbu made an overt display of his own difference, a difference that brooked no objections: he was wearing a red tie, an elegant, immaculately pressed shirt, and a dark, official-looking suit. It was as if he were scoring points in some kind of match, but with an ostentation that was typical of his way of being in general, not just with me.</p>
<p><br />
&ldquo;You will find it interesting and you will like it,&rdquo; he had stressed that day, when I had been intending merely to have a quick look around, without any obligation to write about it. I accepted without pleasure, as there was no question of there being anything in it for me. I myself don&rsquo;t know why. Probably I had nothing better to do. That is the truth: at first, it was without any motive. It was because of that authority of his, which left nobody any room for objections, and his cutting irony if he sensed you were wavering, Alin Sarbu knew how to give orders and on a number of occasions when I was present, I noticed that he was obeyed in military fashion, without protest. In the first, and perhaps also the second, year after the fall of Ceausescu, this was something very rare, an exception, even an anomaly. Almost nobody had a firm mandate of authority not immediately subject to contestation, and this applied all over Romania, from the top of the pyramid to the remotest hamlet. Now, as I reconstruct events, viewing them from a distance, I realise that this is what won me over: his self-confidence. But I suspect that he had sized me up very accurately. What I mean to say is that he intuited something not even I was aware of, that I was moribund, that I was beginning to shrivel up, to atrophy, and that I would soon be completely dead. I think he knew that I did not have the energy to make any objection. Nevertheless, toward me he adopted a roundabout method, which was based on trust, like a privilege.</p>

106 Tineretile lui Daniel Abagiu The Childhoods of Daniel Abagiu Novel Top 10+ series, Polirom, 2012, 216 pages Polirom All rights available <p><em>The Childhoods of Daniel Abagiu </em>(the name contains a pun on the Romanian word <em>labagiu</em>, meaning &lsquo;wanker&rsquo;) is a collection of texts that can be read separately, as short stories, but which are interrelated and form a whole. The main character of these texts is Daniel Abagiu, episodes of whose childhood and adolescence are recounted. The book sets out to fill in the boxes of a Mendeleev&rsquo;s Table of growing up in the final years of the communist period in Romania. Communism makes its presence felt, but it does not fundamentally alter the kind of experiences that children and adolescents have everywhere else in the world. There are tales of holidaying with his parents, schoolboy crushes (when Daniel falls in love with the head of the pioneer detachment, from an older class), magical times spent at his grandparents&rsquo; house in the country, children&rsquo;s outdoor games between the housing blocks where they live or in the school playground, the live hens his parents buy from market and slaughter at home, the fledgling sparrow that he saves after it falls from the nest, the lyceum toilets that become a meeting place where pupils can smoke on the sly, and the protagonist&rsquo;s first sexual experiences. Although written in the third-person, the texts narrate everything from the perspective of the child protagonist, with the candour and cynicism characteristic of childhood. Each text is also accompanied by another in the first person, which contributes the perspective of the grown-up Daniel Abagiu. <br />
The boxes of Mendeleev&rsquo;s Table are not completed in sequence, and some are missing altogether. And so perhaps a better analogy would be a game of hopscotch, around whose squares the reader is invited to jump and thereby reconstruct his own memories of childhood and adolescence.</p> <p>&nbsp;When he was little, his parents used to take him to the seaside and he would always be vexed at all the annoyances he had to put up with before they finally got to the beach. Quite apart from the fact that he would be dying of impatience even before they left the house to catch the train, the journey in itself was an ordeal. Little Danny&rsquo;s family always used to travel to the seaside on the night train, so that they wouldn&rsquo;t have to face the heat of the day (as his mother said), and from early that morning there would always be the most unbelievable commotion.  <br />
As they used to set off at around three or four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the boy had to go to bed early and have a good sleep beforehand. This forced early bedtime reminded little Danny of New Year&rsquo;s Eve. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t sleep so much as a wink, because he was too excited and he would keep bombarding his mother with the words: &ldquo;Oh no! It won&rsquo;t be long before we&rsquo;re gone!&rdquo; To the horror of his mother, who was superstitious about certain expressions and always used to explain to him, with increasing irritation, that when you say somebody &ldquo;is gone&rdquo; it means he&rsquo;s dead. God forfend!</p>
<p><br />
*<br />
As soon as they arrived at the station, little Danny&rsquo;s enthusiasm would wane and then crumble to dust when he was confronted with the unstoppable tide of people boarding the train. Once on board, and once the luggage had been manhandled into place, the children were straightaway lain across the adults&rsquo; knees and told to go to sleep. In each compartment of the train there were at least two or three children subjected to the same, invariable treatment. Little Danny couldn&rsquo;t stand lying with his head in either his mother&rsquo;s or his father&rsquo;s lap. But was there any reasoning with them? They would force him to lie down and were oblivious to his whingeing. To make things worse, when the conductor came, they would tell him to curl up so he would look smaller, because they had paid half-fare for him and little Danny was no longer the right age. But the representative of the law was not to be deceived and there would always be a big argument with his parents. To show the conductor how little the child was, his mother would sit him on her knees (true, he was heavy), she would pat his head and say: &ldquo;Calm down, pet! You sit here with mummy!&rdquo; As if he was the one who wasn&rsquo;t calm&hellip;</p>
<p><br />
*<br />
After the storm whipped up by the man who punched the tickets had died down (in the end, he would retreat, his head spinning from all the parents&rsquo; arguments), the moment would come for all the passengers in the compartment to get out their packets of nosh: plastic cups, tomatoes sliced with a razor blade, thermos flasks, smoked cheese, penknife forks, chicken legs, chicken breasts, cucumbers, sausages, medicine flacons filled with salt &ndash; it all made little Danny dizzy. <br />
But what made him dizziest of all was the smell of boiled egg, which, after being announced by three successive raps on the metal edge of the little foldout table, would invade the entire compartment, amplified by coming from as many sources as there were passengers. The boy would grow nauseous, but they never opened the window until much later, in the morning, when they caught their first sight of the sea, crowding up to the window and gazing in enchantment at the blue patch of water. It was natural that they should gaze so dreamily, because in the landscape before their eyes they glimpsed the seductive promises of an unforgettable holiday.</p>
<p><br />
*<br />
After the train stopped in Constanta, little Danny would start to perk up. What he liked most of all was when they passed the nudists (who would be facing the railway line, legs spread and arms akimbo to catch the ultraviolet rays) and it was strange that each time the train would speed up. Then he would recall the time he went to Tekirg&ouml;l, when he was little. How gullible he had been back then! He was revolted, even frightened, by the therapeutic mud and his father would say that he was going to make him a general: he would paint epaulettes, buttons and insignia on him, and little Danny would stand there proud at having become an important person all of a sudden, but then his father would smear his whole body, telling him it was healthy and that it would stop him from getting rheumatism. Little Danny wouldn&rsquo;t understand and he would burst into tears, upset at not being a general any more and at having been tricked.<br />
It was also at Tekirg&ouml;l that his father had run into a friend, a workmate, and they spent all the time talking together. Little Danny would sunbathe with the men, with his father and his workmate, and as the two were talking endlessly and he was terribly bored, the lad got it into his head to put his finger on the thingy that his father carried around under his belly with such great care. The friend had made a scandalised face and his father had clouted him. Touch it and it grows. And grown it had.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>*</strong><br />
At the office where they allocated hotel rooms for the whole resort it was hot, crowded, and stuffy. Tempers were fraying and in the crush the slightest thing could spark a row. This holiday, the same as every year, his father had obtained tickets for the Venus resort via his union. There was always a long wait to be allocated a room. Little Danny was sitting to one side, on one of the suitcases, and his parents were sweating and being jostled in the throng. The boy was again getting very bored. He kept stepping outside, but not for very long, because his parents had left him in charge of the luggage, in case anything got nicked. He looked at the people. He played with a suitcase fastener. He ate some more puffed rice. He was sick of everything, especially given that the beach was not visible from there. Everything was dry and dusty. You would have thought you were not even at the seaside. From time to time a woman with a babe in arms would enter, in despair at having been given a room that was infested with bedbugs, flooded because of a burst pipe, or covered in mould from the damp. The other people would all take the side of the woman against the people at the counter &ndash; what with her having a small child as well, the poor thing!<br />
*<br />
They were staying at the Hotel Diana, on the tenth floor. His father, who had brought with him all his tackle, would straightaway station himself on the seawall with his fishing rod. He almost always used to bring back a brace of fish, which he would place in the bathroom sink with the cold tap running. For this reason, the sink was occupied most of the time and they had to get washed using the tap from the bathtub. In spite of all his precautions, the fish would quickly go off. In any case, there wasn&rsquo;t anywhere they could cook them. His father always used to say that he would take them to the restaurant kitchen, give the staff some money, and ask them to cook the fish the way he liked it, with garlic juice, but this never came to pass. Instead, there were endless discussions about the nature of the fish. The problem was that gobies look like dogfish, which have a nasty sting in their tail and are inedible, if not downright poisonous. His mother would always claim that the fish his father brought included dogfish, or that they were all dogfish, and that he was reckless, that he could kill them all, including the boy. He would do better to throw them away, not to keep them there pointlessly. His father would keep his cool. He would leave the fish where they were and bring yet another full bag each morning. <br />
Once, when little Danny was sitting on the seawall next to him, his father pulled a fish from the water and after examining it, tossed it at the lad, shouting: &ldquo;Dogfish! Dogfish!&rdquo; Little Danny started to bawl and cry. Although he was in a very good mood, his father lost his temper in the end, because the boy would not stop snivelling. It was making him embarrassed, because people kept looking at them, and so he whacked the boy across the back of his head, causing little Danny to fall off the rock atop which he was sitting and scrape his knee. The boy kept screaming, now even louder, and did not stop until his mother came and told him consolingly that there was no need to cry, because the fish had not been a dogfish, but a goby. <br />
There is still a photograph of little Danny peering at his scraped knee, his snivelling face all twisted. His father had insisted on immortalising the moment. <br />
*<br />
One morning, while his father was out buying postcards to send to relatives and his mother was lying with her hands behind her head, eyes closed, soaking up ultraviolet rays, little Danny had gone off along the seashore all by himself to look for big, unbroken shells. There had been a storm that night and with a little luck you could find wonderful things. The sea was calm and the waves sometimes lapped against his ankles or erased his footprints in the sand.<br />
As he was walking along, he saw a group of men doing something. What exactly they were doing he couldn&rsquo;t tell. Out of curiosity he went up to them and no little was his wonder when he saw a huge fish lying on the sand. The men were saying that it had been brought in by the tide and were wondering what kind of fish it might be. Some said it was a dolphin. Whatever it may have been, the men were practical-minded and so they set about cutting it up and skinning it. Even though he had seen dolphins on the television and thus knew them very well (he was mad for Flipper), little Danny no longer had any way of knowing what that heap of sliced-up flesh might once have been. They had cut off the tail and it was lying to one side, of no interest to anybody. Little Danny plucked up courage, bent down, and touched it. It was as big as his head and covered in thick, black, rubbery skin. The lad would have liked to ask them for the tail, given that he could see they didn&rsquo;t need it, but he was too embarrassed. He thought that he could have used it when he went swimming: he had seen some foreign tourists using a flipper for two feet. <br />
On another day, he saw another crowd of people gathered on the beach. It was around noon and he was lying with his mother on the sheet (his father was out on the sea wall). The word went from mouth to mouth that somebody had drowned and all the people on the beach were looking in that direction with worried faces. Some were peering through binoculars. Little Danny wanted to go and see, but his mother forbade him. Some people who were coming away from there said that the body was bloated and purple. Little Danny was horrified that the poor man was going to suffer the same fate as the dolphin and he hated from the bottom of his heart the gaggle of people around the drowned body.</p>
<p><br />
*<br />
Little Danny was having lots of fun by the seaside. He was building sandcastles with fences made from the matchsticks or cigarette butts he found on the beach. His folks had bought him a water pistol, which he used to squirt them with when they were sunbathing. And sometimes his mother would take him to the merry-go-round or buy him candyfloss and popcorn. But most of all little Danny liked to paddle in the sea. He had an inflatable ring with the word Olympus written on it. He was always swimming, making a honk-honk noise when other people got in his way. His mother did not know how to swim and that is probably why she did not let him stay in the water long. She kept telling him that he would catch a cold and made him lie next to her on the sheet so he could sunbathe, telling him to turn face up or face down from time to time. <br />
When little Danny stayed in the water too long, his mother would get annoyed and tell him to come back to the sheet that instant and to take his underpants off, because they were wet and would make him catch cold. The first time, he did not want to, but when his mother lost her temper he had no choice but to take them off. He quickly turned over on his tummy, but his mother was having none of it and told him to lie on his back, to soak up the sun on his front, because he had lain face down long enough. With much grumbling, little Danny lay on his back and because he was overcome with embarrassment, he put a towel over his face. At least they wouldn&rsquo;t see his face. But the towel didn&rsquo;t do much good. He could still hear people passing next to the sheet and he wanted the earth to swallow him up. What is more, as if to make a complete fool of him, he could feel his thingy starting to grow bigger, little by little, unstoppably.</p>
<p><br />
*<br />
It was night. The beach was deserted. From nearby music wafted from a restaurant, and little Danny was walking barefoot over the sand. He did not know how he had got there. He was walking and looking left and right to see whether he could find any toys, like he had found a metal toy tractor one morning, no doubt left behind by a foreign child. But no such luck this time!<br />
The sea was black, as if it were muddy. There was so much of it that you could make millions of mud epaulettes, buttons, and insignia. <br />
He found himself up to the waist in mud. Then he realised that his whole body was smeared with mud. Horrible! He was about to burst into tears when he noticed that he was in fact in the sea and that the water was washing the mud off him. <br />
The moon had risen above the sea. It was a full moon. A streak of light streamed towards him. He wanted to follow the luminous trail, but it took him great efforts to move. In fact, no matter how hard he tried, he could move no further. It was as if he were stuck in something highly viscous that prevented movement. Then he jerked forward and began to swim. He was free now and noticed that he could reach a very high speed. The water was like a very soft, welcoming bed, in which he felt safe. He romped right and left. His body obeyed him instantly and he had but to jerk in order to move in any direction he wished. <br />
He swam for a long time, and joy pervaded his whole body, giving him a pleasant tingling sensation. When he noticed that day was breaking, he started to turn somersaults: he leapt above the water as high as he could, he dived, and then he leapt again even higher, moving his body very gracefully through the air. After a while, he thought that he had better go back, although he would have liked to stay. He had been gone quite a long time and his mother would make a scene again. He began to swim slowly to the shore. As he neared the seawall, he noticed a figure perched on a rock overlooking the sea. He recognised his father, diligent as ever, and he could barely contain his admiration: he got up so early each morning! He went closer the better to see him. His father was sitting motionless, and his face was bathed in the red dawn light. He swam back and forth and then it occurred to him: &ldquo;I should avoid Dad&rsquo;s fishing hook,&rdquo; he told himself and struck out towards the shore.<br />
He was nearing the shore at speed, a little frightened at what might have happened with the hook, when all of a sudden he felt himself stop suddenly and a strange ache overwhelmed him. It was like utter exhaustion. He wanted to cry out, but when he opened his mouth no sound emerged. He was trembling all over, and when he felt as though he was suffocating, as his vision grew dim, he saw as if in a dream some people gathered around him, stooping over him, examining him curiously.</p>

108 Love, Nothing Less Dragostea, chiar ea Novel Ego. Prose series, Polirom, 2012, 200 pages Polirom All rights available <p>&nbsp;Everything changes for Mia and Teo that spring morning when they first meet in the lobby of the Ministry of Agriculture. Love comes into their lives, so powerfully that it makes them leave everything else behind. It rids Teo of the suffering caused by separation from his ex-wife and children, whom he loses in the divorce. It helps Mia to regain her self-confidence, to forget that she is nothing but a humble functionary in a dusty ministry. Realising that she has never loved any man the way she loves Teo, she leaves her husband. At her insistence, he agrees to a divorce, resigns from the legal practice where he works, and retires to the countryside, where he takes up beekeeping. Confronted with so many obstacles and a painful past, Mia and Teo imagine that their love has something heroic about it. They decide to join their destinies together, hoping to find tranquillity thereby.</p>
<p><br />
Visiting his children one day, Teo finds his ex-wife in tears. Devastated she tells him that her lover has left her. His regrets at having listened to her plaints all night long dissolve in the dawn light, when Lily makes an unexpected proposal: that he should come back to her and the children. Only a few months have passed since he met Mia, but it has been long enough for Teo to understand that her love will never cure his longing for his children. Teo&rsquo;s decision to go back to Lily and her own discovery that she is pregnant plunge Mia into the blackest depression. One morning, on her way to the ministry, she is overwhelmed by her memories and realises that she has never stopped loving Vlad even for one moment. But how could she even begin to suspect that Vlad, in order to atone for his past mistakes, has decided to marry a woman he met at Sunday morning mass in the village where he has gone to get away from it all? Nevertheless, she manages to win him back quite easily. It is enough for her to convince him that their love is more important than his charitable urges. Reconciled that she has found the man alongside whom she wishes to grow old, Mia finally agrees to grant Teo a divorce. She is not overly saddened by the abortion she undergoes, and nor does she bother her head about who the father may have been. Countless things happen, but the characters keep going round and round in a circle, always ending up back where they started. Two couples whose members seem inseparable, but who succumb to the temptation of the new; two couples whose destinies intersect and who move within a society as devoid of will and certainty as they are. A story about the frailty of human feelings and the paltriness of romantic love.</p> <p>&nbsp;He was going to work hard and take care of the children. When they were older, he was going to take them far away, on a long journey. He kept choosing different destinations. Sometimes he would choose a little town in Greece, with narrow streets, white houses, and colourful flowers at the windows. Then he would decide that they would go to Tuscany and walk among the hills, vineyards, and olive groves. Sometimes he would dream of taking them to Paris or Prague. At other times, he would think that a village in the mountains was the most appropriate destination. The dry leaves would rustle underfoot and the past would scatter like mist. Better still, they would tour the whole of Europe by car. They would stop off in towns en route and saunter all day long, eating takeaway pancakes and kebabs, entering museums they chanced to see on the way, window-shopping, and having parrots pick out slips of paper telling their fortunes. Mitzi would pester him to buy him new sandals with Velcro straps, and Jana would pester him to buy her a sun hat with a bunch of violets. They would stay at expensive hotels at first, where the chambermaids would leave chocolate bonbons wrapped in foil on the pillows, and later they would stop at out-of-town hostels or pitch a tent at a campsite next to some old hippies, who would wake them up at night with their coughing. But they were going to spend every night under a different sky. <br />
He would be gripped by nostalgia when he saw his colleagues laughing together. With a pang in his heart, he used to wonder whether the day would ever come when all his thoughts would cease to spring from the same painful root. He clung to the future; the present threw him out of kilter like a patient agonising in an adjacent room. The plan he had made for himself helped him to survive. Yes, he was going to work hard and take care of the children. And he was going to be good, courageous, and worthy, or better, more courageous, and worthier. But his noble intentions yielded to the insipid everyday, and so in the end he resigned himself, as thitherto, to giving money to beggars and gainsaying his boss from the time to time. What also seemed absurd to him was the promise he had made not to tell Jana or Mihai about anything of the things that happened, not even that their mother had been the one who left him for another man. The children, and here he remembered his quarrel with Lily, ought to find out the truth, to know how hard he fought to stop her leaving him.</p>
<p><br />
All the suffering that loomed up before him had made him forget about women, and so his memory&rsquo;s stubborn insistence on Mia irked him. He thought it had more to do with the ridiculous scene in the lift. The young women with sinewy arms, laden with thermos flasks and plastic cups, who had rushed to greet the two men and who wafted around themselves an aroma of musk. Amid peals of laughter, they were remembering a conversation about the Vatican and washing machines. Then the lean man who had euphorically waved his folder and shouted that he was off to check the central-heating system. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a head full of crazy ideas, but if you give her a little shake, she straightaway becomes prim and proper,&rdquo; Teo told himself, trying to rid himself of thoughts of Mia, except that this inoffensive description did nothing to drive her from his mind. <br />
He gets up from his desk and goes over to the window. He does the same thing almost every evening: at a given moment he gets up from his desk and stands in front of the window, content to gaze once more at the chestnut trees, the newspaper stand, the bagel shop, the cobbler&rsquo;s workshop, and the ten-storey blocks with pharmacies on the ground floor. He has looked out over this scene so many times: he has gazed at it trying to quell his fear, he has seen it after the rain, when its colours come back to life, he has examined it at night, trying to retrace each outline, but it has never looked to him the way it does now: a street in a strange city, through which he might walk for the first time. <br />
The bagel shop was the only thing that had not been there already. It had opened a few months after he moved in. It had taken the place of a second-hand clothes shop that was always promising &ldquo;new collections,&rdquo; and before that there had been a flower shop, with chrysanthemums of every colour in the window. There is a scent of linden trees and wet asphalt. A black cat carefully avoids a puddle and then arches its back contentedly. The driver of a car shouts at an old man crossing the road lugging a shopping bag and because he does not quicken his steps, he sprays him with the windscreen sprinkler. A man and a woman are fighting over a pushchair in which a small child snugly wrapped in a headscarf is wailing. &ldquo;Get your paws off!&rdquo; the woman shouts, slapping the man across the hand as he tries to grab the pushchair. The boy on roller-skates passed like a streak of lightning, but it was enough to remind him: the black clothes, the rock music, the language that strove to sound tough, and so much bombast that you couldn&rsquo;t help but feel superior. He smiles; that was what he used to be like or thought he was like. A young couple are embracing and kissing; her hands are clinging to his neck and stroking the mole on his nape. A few steps farther on they stop and kiss once more, this time more listlessly. <br />
From beneath the vine trellis of the block opposite appears the lad with the sprained leg. A white poodle trots alongside him, adjusting its pace to its master&rsquo;s, as loyal as any poodle. Let it get a little darker and then the girl in the wheelchair will appear. He will smile and, throwing his head back and taking a deep, contented breath, he will whisper something about her mother and father, who take it in turns to walk her. And she will have a different headscarf from the one she had yesterday; she always changes her headscarf. <br />
Sometimes the fear grew little by little. At other times, it burst forth violently. Teo would have liked to go into the children&rsquo;s room, to watch them sleeping, to make sure they were all right. He would have calmed his breathing in time with theirs, he would have heard them snoring gently, murmuring words unintelligible to Zaza or Berth, the man with the matchsticks, and the tranquillity would have seeped deeper and deeper inside him. <br />
The chestnut trees, the newspaper stand, the bagel shop, the cobbler&rsquo;s workshop, the ten-storey blocks with pharmacies on the ground floor. His eyes travel over them once more, but this time he is not afraid. He wonders whether he should write to Mia. He ponders it, despite having become even more furious at Remus, his ex-wife&rsquo;s lover, on his way home: that man who touches his teeth, proudly stating that he is &ldquo;quite a hypochondriac&rdquo;, had had the temerity to speak about Daisy, their dog that died one spring. Mitzi had dreamed of her playing with her small rubber ball. Teo had missed the opportunity. He hadn&rsquo;t heard it with his own ears when Mitzi said that Daisy was no longer beneath the tree where they buried her, wrapped up snugly in Jana&rsquo;s green sweater. He hadn&rsquo;t been able to reinforce Mitzi&rsquo;s conviction that just like in his dream Daisy was playing with a rubber ball somewhere even now. But instead, that strange man, who bathes and soaps himself in his children&rsquo;s tub, was with Mitzi when he described his dream and he had the audacity to tell him that nobody could know what Daisy was doing now. Absorbed in his imaginary dialogue with Remus, he doesn&rsquo;t realise that he is expressing his disgust aloud, until a young girl with ribbons in her hair turns her head to stare at him. He quickens his pace, embarrassed. <br />
He was the strange man that Lily had taken up with; she had driven him away, she had taken up with that strange man, and they had disported themselves between his sheets, while Jana and Mitzi were cutting out paper reindeer and gnomes. In vain had Teo tried to help her; Lily could not remember anything. Not even that Mitzi and Jana had grown inside her; not even that one day they had chosen together the wall where they were going to hang the painting she had bought years ago: the outline of a house rising behind a garden that shone with many colours. To Teo it looked more like a pyramid, but Lily insisted that it was a house. &ldquo;I was afraid that I was never going to hang it on the wall. I couldn&rsquo;t bear so much beauty,&rdquo; she said, and she may also have burst into tears. <br />
But Teo has put such thoughts behind him. If he writes to her, maybe Mia will reply, and then he will write to her again. And if she replies once, maybe she will do so again, and this second e-mail from her will make him even happier than the first, because then he will have reasons to believe that she is writing out of more than politeness.</p>
<p><br />
***<br />
Mia has been overwhelmed by misgivings since shortly after she parted from Teo in front of the director&rsquo;s office. She is afraid lest she has opened her soul only because she knew that the man standing in front of her was the author of the IT programme being implemented in the ministry and because he insisted on her telling him the title of that film she liked. She is also tormented by the thought that maybe Teo is now under the impression that it is one of her favourite films, which it isn&rsquo;t. Realising that she cares about what he thinks of her, she becomes even more annoyed with herself. Then her regrets fade away and she has to admit: it has been a long time since she last felt as alive as she did during their talk by the green wall. <br />
But her moods are changeable: after moments of exaltation comes remorse. Nevertheless, she often lets slip a contented, almost superior smile, and a number of times she catches herself speaking with unwonted self-assurance, as if she had just got back from a congress in Brussels. She knows she is going to forget Teo; she has forgotten other men who have made her feel the way she felt with him, by the green wall. And she also knows that she will forget him even if she spends almost all her time at the ministry looking at the two photographs she found on the Internet, in which she strives to find once more the man by the green wall that shone in the sun. <br />
In one, Teo looks like he is taking advantage of the fact that he is having his photograph taken in order to have a breather. In the other, he is sitting at a desk covered with blue baize, full of papers and microphones. His mouth is half open and he is gesticulating with one hand. This is the photograph that Mia looks at the most, trying to get used to Teo&rsquo;s teeth: small and tightly packed, they bear a striking resemblance to the teeth of a Pekinese. The photograph is accompanied by a kind of curriculum vitae, which gives her the opportunity to find out his date of birth, the fact that he is a graduate in informatics, and that he went on to take an MA and courses abroad. Besides the programme that has made him famous at the ministry, he has also contributed to a number of books.</p>
<p><br />
Mia knows that one day she will give up looking at the two photographs. It will come about of itself, without pain or effort, just as the mood that came over her by the green wall will also relinquish her. All she has to do is to look after the routine that comprises her life, and this is something Mia does with pleasure. <br />
She wakes up in a house where tranquillity never smothers life. This leads her to believe that Vlad and she are a radiant couple. Then he drives her to the ministry. On one side is the man she loves, on the other the city. She leans her head back and looks at the blocks, the trees, the telephone booths, the people, and the sky rushing in the opposite direction, the same as her life, without her making any great demands of it, has been rushing by ever since she met Vlad. <br />
She was not expecting it, but she has become attached to the ministry. She knows its hidden nooks; she knows the different sound of her footfalls along one corridor or another and how the light slants through the windows. From time to time she goes up to the flat roof on the sixth floor and strolls among the dandelions and forget-me-nots that have poked through the bitumen. The ministry resembles an old man who has not left the house for years. He avoids mingling with young people, but is not sad on his own in the house. He listens to melodies from his youth, mumbles old-fashioned expressions, and caresses the faces in photographs. <br />
From her office Mia can see an old ivy-clad building. If she had a mind, she could tot up the number of times she has seen the leaves change colour; how many times the green has turned to yellow, the yellow to orange, and the orange to red before vanishing altogether for a time. Ten, eleven, twelve: how many years had passed? She does not care to know. &ldquo;What persists throughout change is change itself.&rdquo; She looks at the ivy and recalls the saying to mind, one of the few she has remembered since school, but she never has time to find out who said it. <br />
She sips her hot coffee, looking out of the window at the ivy. Her office is like a fluffy pillow, which invites you to snooze a little longer after you wake up. But it is the other office, no. 405, where her ministry really lies. After she finishes her coffee, her conscience at ease after having shown her face to the boss for long enough and joyful at starting a new day, so comforting in its amazing similarity to every other day, it is there that she goes. From time to time, some obstacle arises to prevent her from leaving, but this happens only rarely and then she suffers like a woman prevented from seeing the man she loves. Also from time to time, she remembers that she is paid for her work at the ministry. But she easily rids herself of this thought. Even if she got it into her head to do more work, she would not be able to find it. And so, taking with her a document or file, mumbling something and bathing her colleagues in a warm glance, she goes out.</p>

109 Hotel Universal Hotel Universal Novel Ego. Prose series, Polirom, 2012, 272 pages Polirom Bozicevic (Croatia) <p>The story of <em>Hotel Universal</em> begins in what was one of the main places to be in old Bucharest, and from here, via events, coincidences and above all characters, the space built by a member of a local merchant dynasty spreads its web as far as the Crimea, Bulgaria, Constantinople, Aleppo, and Damascus. Through the serial ironies of history, the Hotel Universal, the bellybutton of the world of days gone by, becomes an oriental sink, a secret headquarters for the communist secret police, a proletarian brothel, and finally a refuge for bohemian students in the years immediately following the 1989 Revolution. It is said that in the beginning, the Hotel Universal, originally called the Hagi Tudorache Inn, after one of its first owners, was located in the exact centre of Bucharest. A strange place, with countless hidden nooks and labyrinthine cellars, the building at No. 12 Gabroveni Street has led many lives: it has burned down a number of times, been rebuilt, and witnessed dramatic events recorded in the chronicles of the times. It survived the communist period, with numerous alterations, and after 1989 was converted into a student hall of residence, living a third, equally unpredictable life until it was reclaimed by its former owners and recently closed down. <br />
The novel is set in two different historical periods: the first commences in 1856, when Vasile Capsa, the founder of the celebrated Bucharest restaurant of the same name, suffers a dismal failure in his first major business enterprise, which takes him to the Crimea; the second begins in the spring of 1993, when a murder or suicide &ndash; which of the two remains to be seen &ndash; takes place in the Hotel Universal. The character who links these two temporal planes is the fantastical, somnambulant Maia, the great-great-granddaughter of the &ldquo;golden girl&rdquo; that Capsa brings back with him from the Crimea. In a room in the Hotel Universal she writes and rewrites the family story her grandmother has recounted to her over the course of many years, in a ritual that constantly changed according to the girl&rsquo;s age, tastes and interest. As she recalls her grandmother&rsquo;s accounts, the family story is transformed into a series of &ldquo;narrative exercises&rdquo; (classic or postmodern, streams of consciousness or third-person storytelling) and, above all, &ldquo;spiritual exercises&rdquo;, which, like those of Ignacio de Loyola, are not to be read, but practised. <br />
An autobiographical fiction and a book of initiation, <em>Hotel Universal</em> is the novel of a bygone world, a motley, cosmopolitan world, but whose essential values have remained intact.</p> <p>&nbsp;1.</p>
<p><br />
On the night when they laid its foundation stone, the Hotel Universal (or the Teodoraki Hotel, as it was known at the time) was still in the middle of Bucharest, as if somebody had taken rule and compass and measured out equal distances from the Paupers&rsquo; Quarter to the Cuckoo Market and from the rills of the Tanners&rsquo; Quarter to the Water Tower. And if, after taking those measurements, that somebody had paused pensively on the empty spot purchased in July 1849 by Hagi Tudorache for trade in Leipzig wares, he would have been amazed to see approaching at around midnight from the direction of the Red Inn, without haste and without talking among themselves, the three merchants who had banded together to build the inn: Tudorache, Leon Manoach and George San Marin. The spring rain shower had stopped a few minutes earlier, but the changeable April air had not yet cleared. They slowly walked past the Greeks&rsquo; Inn, turned toward the Stavropoleos Monastery, and emerged from Saddlers Street in the lane at the back of the Old Court, still silent and with a heavy gait, as if they were on their way to be tried in a court of law. When they reached the back of the shop of Ghinea the shalwar merchant, Hagi Tudorache came to a halt and took from his pocket a key, with which he unlocked a slab-like portal on the other side of the lane, which led down into a cellar. The three descended into a narrow tunnel that smelled of something burnt. Behind them, the slab shut soundlessly in the exact moment when it began to rain once more. <br />
It is not known for sure what happened in the cellar, recounted Maria, more than a hundred years later, in the kitchen where she was making rose-petal jam with Maia. Leon Manoach had later told his wife, Sofia, and she had told Radu, in her room at the Hotel Universal, that as soon as he descended below ground he had sensed a smell of sulphur and burnt wood. It had crossed his mind that he should go back, but as we was moving through the narrow tunnel between Hagi Tudorache and George San Marin, it would not have been easy. And so the three of them went forward &ndash; after descending the wet, slimy flight of steps (nobody had passed that way since they had been washed) &ndash; as far as the end of the passage, with only Tudorache&rsquo;s candle to light the way as he led them to view the cellar of the future inn. It had also been Tudorache who, two years previously, had purchased from Polizu and Petrovici the foundations burnt in the great fire, without yet knowing what he was going do with the site. He felt old and ill, he moved with increasing difficulty on legs that were like lead and tingled painfully in the morning, and it was increasingly difficult for him to find joy in anything. But those places, which would later be called Gabroveni, had awakened him. He wished to build an inn there, not a bezesten &ndash; a Turkish-style enclosed bazaar for merchants &ndash; but a house for men of lesser girth and their close lady friends. <br />
He had the money to build it for himself and to give it the name he dreamed of: The Tudoraki Inn. Sometimes, at night, he would see the inn sign shining between the gas lamps. In the daytime, he would see it standing out between the two storeys among the hodgepodge of Gabroveni Street commercial premises. At the last meeting with his brothers (a meeting of the richest merchants of Bucharest, held every year at the end of April, attended if not by the Prince&rsquo;s adjutant, then at least by a special envoy of the Leipzig merchants), however, he had been advised to join forces with Manaoch and San Marin to build the inn in the middle of the lane at the rear of the Old Court. Each was to contribute equal parts, leaving a fathom for the lane. But the cellar was to remain intact, swarming with vermin and reeking of mire. &ldquo;How could Hagi Tudorache build a fine building over such a sewer?&rdquo; wondered Maria, leaving Maia to eat her jam and hurrying off to answer the telephone, which would not stop ringing. <br />
They walked like that for an unknown length of time, as the tunnel twisted and seemingly turned back in the direction whence it set out, Maria went on, showing Maia the green chair. Sometimes they trod on each other&rsquo;s heels and splashed each other when Costache came to a stop, making a sound like a bridled horse: before them opened a circular room, in the middle of which they saw a stone blackened presumably by the fire. As if they had known what to do &ndash; and George San Marin, the only one who never spoke about that night, perhaps really did know &ndash; they knelt around the truncated stone, which resembled a table, and waited until Costache, snuffling and cursing the day when he decided to build himself a hotel, rather than a bezesten, in the heart of Bucharest, lifted himself from the mire and mumbled a few words, of which Leon caught only &ldquo;complete&rdquo; or &ldquo;completely&rdquo;, words that were muffled and creaky, like a door left ajar. At least that is what Sofia recalled, in the Universal, as Rada read the coffee grounds.</p>
<p><br />
2.<br />
By the early &rsquo;90s, when the Hotel Universal at No. 12 Gabroveni Street was converted into a student hall of residence, the building had long since ceased to be at the exact centre of Bucharest. Dilapidated and damp, infested with rats which swarmed along long corridors covered in an ancient mustard-coloured carpet, which, especially in summer, emanated an odour akin to that of a stagnant pool, the Universal was conceded to the League of University Students after many nights of cunning negotiations. The building could not be demolished, as it had been nationalised illegally, but nor could it be used as a hotel for normal people, and so it became a bargaining chip in negotiations between the new crypto-communist regime and the students who but a few weeks previously had fled panic-stricken beneath hails of bullets that were either real (as they themselves believed) or imagined (as others would later claim). &ldquo;What did we die for in December?&rdquo; one of the heads of the League of Students had asked during the negotiations held in January. <br />
&ldquo;For the Universal,&rdquo; answered one of the new secretaries of state from the Ministry of Education, who was still in the habit of slowly pronouncing his name followed by his new title when he looked in the mirror each morning. And the answer of that new political commissar was to have a long career at the ministry in question. For years and years, whenever there were tough negotiations or budgetary recalculations whereby money was channelled elsewhere than would have been normal, the final answer to the question, asked in mocking tones and increasingly drowned out by deep guffaws, &ldquo;What did we die for in December?&rdquo; the final, abyssal answer, provoking peals of laughter, was always the same: &ldquo;For the Universal.&rdquo;<br />
Maia lived at the Hotel Universal from the very beginning. She had chanced to be present at the nocturnal negotiations, when the former proletarian brothel (as Teodoraki&rsquo;s inn had become after being nationalised by the communists) was allocated as a student hall of residence, and, via the former revolutionaries&rsquo; associations, she had been given a room on the top floor: a mansard added in the 1970s. At night, when frenetic music and orgasmic shouts echoed up from the inner courtyard to her book-crammed mansard with a balcony, Maia knew with a clarity she was not wont to analyse that she had come home. In spite of all this, she had never lived in Bucharest before. She was completely unfamiliar with the city&rsquo;s old centre, with its reeking, crooked streets. Not even in films had she ever seen anything as promiscuous as the Hotel Universal on Gabroveni Street. Nevertheless, when for the first time she touched the metal bar of the glass door in the main entrance and trod the broad red marble step in which the letters HU were embedded in white stone, she felt the tangled knot of rage that had accumulated around her thymus during long years of failure, humiliation, and fear begin to dissolve. <br />
She entered the smoky lobby where the bar of the former hotel still plied its trade alongside the administration of the new hall of residence. Nothing had changed, she told herself, in that anomalous way typical of her nature. Some swarthy men were leaning against the wall to the left. Rhythmic thuds could be heard coming from behind the bar. And when Maia said hello, as if she were in the reception of a real hotel, the laughter changed to snarls and grunts and the music from the bar began to howl. For an instant she felt the urge to open the door by which she had just entered and flee. But she remained standing in the middle of the bar, bewildered, trying to understand what she was doing there and above all why she felt at home in that sewer in which she had arrived by chance. <br />
For a moment she thought about whether she should take the lift to her room on the last floor. But she straightaway abandoned the idea &ndash; a life-saving intuition, as she was to say to herself a few weeks later, when the lift cabin broke loose in the middle of the night and fell from the top floor all the way to the basement with an infernal crash. She climbed the two double storeys, where the rooms were twice as tall as the mansard. The staircase narrowed toward the large windows that looked over the inner courtyard, whence could be heard a cacophony of competing music and somebody shouting at the top of his lungs &ldquo;Nora!&rdquo; It smelled of garbage and plaster and undoubtedly this was how it would smell to the very end: two distinct, superposed smells, one heavy and sour, the other artificial. On the second floor she paused. It was dark. The only light was from outside. She felt a scraggily cat rub up against her legs, but it scampered away before she could get a look at it. This was the only time she ever saw a cat in the Universal. Out of breath, she slowly climbed the staircase, which by now wound in a spiral, and began to look for her room, using a lighter to see the numbers on the doors. At the end of the staircase she turned right instead of left and had to retrace her steps when she saw that the door numbers were getting higher. She groped back the other way, burning her fingers on the yellowish flame of the lighter, and on the second door she saw the number 308 writ in large figures. She took the massy key from her pocket, whose large metal fob weighed at least a quarter of a kilogram, and tried to open the door. The lock would not turn. Starting to panic and trying to force the lock, she realised that the door, which had suddenly and silently swung open, as if it had been oiled only yesterday, was in fact open.</p>

110 Preventative Disorder Dezordinea preventiva Novel Prose series, Cartea romaneasca, 2011, 264 pages Cartea romaneasca All rights available <p>The central character of the novel <em>Preventative Disorder</em> is a young journalist who discovers the excesses and delirium of the media machine in a Paris press office. He allows himself to be initiated into techniques of manipulation by an older colleague, George, a man in the grip of a kind of metaphysical disgust. One night, an overly friendly rat turns up in the press office and seems to be trying to initiate a dialogue with the human race&hellip; During an assignment to Luxembourg to report on a European Union summit, the young journalist is surprised to discover that the proceedings are dedicated to &ldquo;good neighbourliness with rats.&rdquo; Human consumer society has reached crisis point and only the rats, which offer their services as living garbage disposal units, can save mankind&rsquo;s lifestyle. And the best news the human race has ever received is that the rats are willing to mop up not only man&rsquo;s material squalor, but also his moral squalor. <br />
Against the backdrop of a narrative that glides from the real to the fantastical and back, the reader is witness to the rise of a new &ldquo;media dictatorship&rdquo; and discovers the existence of a mysterious press agency, which recruits new talent capable of dreaming up future &ldquo;scenarios of disorder.&rdquo; Now that the mass media have taken over the world, they have to produce <em>preventative disorder</em> in order to have news reports to file and to feed mankind&rsquo;s appetite for sensation. Peace and real progress would spell the death of the media machine, which is why it also interested in always being a step ahead of real history and in concocting the next global scandal. In this novel/manifesto, Matei Visniec, himself a radio journalist (he worked for the BBC from 1988 to 1999, and since 1990 he has worked for RFI) attempts to provide an X-ray image of these new forms of brainwashing.</p> <p>&nbsp;Every now and again I feel like telling George: stop, you&rsquo;re going to have a nervous breakdown, why not enjoy the city, look how beautiful it is, it takes your breath away when you see it from on high, look how harmonious it is, and on a day like this, with a clear blue sky, you can almost count the people, even the lifts going up and down the metal lacework of the Eiffel Tower are crystal clear&hellip; Why don&rsquo;t we talk about <em>a day like today</em>?<br />
&ldquo;Did you say something?&rdquo; asks George.<br />
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;As for myself, I&rsquo;m getting dirtier and <em>dirtier</em>,&rdquo; George continues. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve started doing things I never did thirty years ago, when I started out in this trade. I no longer even consider myself a journalist. No. I&rsquo;m a gravedigger. When I take my seat in front of the microphone to read the news, I straight away sense how torpid the listener will be if I don&rsquo;t supply him with enough dead bodies, enough abjection, enough <em>tension</em>&hellip; When I have only three or four dead bodies in a newscast, I know it&rsquo;s game over. The other <em>out there</em> won&rsquo;t be listening to me. Or else he will be listening in a more and more superficial way, while his attention wanders off&hellip; Yes, that&rsquo;s the truth, if my newscast has only three or four dead bodies, then I won&rsquo;t be taken seriously. I can almost feel the <em>other&rsquo;s</em> accusation, as if I weren&rsquo;t doing my job properly. For a news bulletin to be <em>interesting</em>, I need at least ten dead bodies. In other words, a two-digit number. And as soon as I start talking about ten, eleven, twelve dead in Gaza, in Israel, in Iraq, in Afghanistan or even in the Ivory Coast (although as a country, it seems <em>too far</em> away), my newscast <em>takes off</em>. Are you listening to me or not?&rdquo;<br />
I don&rsquo;t answer. Conversations with George are also extraordinary because you don&rsquo;t have to answer him. Yes, a lot of the time I say nothing when he asks me something, as I get the impression it doesn&rsquo;t bother him. You can even not listen to George. You can sit at the same table as him and think of something else. You can smoke a cigarette in front of him while gazing at the ceiling. You can jot something down in a notebook or flick through a magazine. None of these things seem to bother him as long as you remain seated at the same table as him, in a nondescript caf&eacute; or in the eighteenth-floor caf&eacute; of the Radio Palace. George abruptly becomes uneasy and boggles his eyes only when you get up to go to the toilet or back to your computer. <br />
&ldquo;What are you doing? Have you <em>had enough</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another thing I like about George, or rather my friendship with him: once you start to know all his theories by heart, you get the feeling that you are their co-author. Ever since I became a journalist, I too have had the feeling that the profession is hiding something from me, that it forces me to tread on shifting sands&hellip; And like George I feel as if the dead of this world have invaded my everyday life. Like George and like hundreds, thousands, maybe tens of thousands of other journalists on this planet, I start my newscast with the <em>latest killings </em>or massacres, or with the latest sensational statements to have come from the mouths of the politicians I detest. How many of us journalists on this planet are subject to the same reflex? To make our newscasts <em>punchy </em>we need at least one new festering wound to have suddenly appeared on the body of mankind. It might take the form of a bloody terrorist attack, of a kidnapping with hostages at risk of being executed by strangulation at any moment, or a spectacular ethnic cleansing operation somewhere in the Caucasus or Balkans (although the ones in Africa are <em>also good</em>). This new wound or rash on the face of mankind might take the form of a terrible air or rail disaster or some other kind of disaster (a landslide, forest fire, earthquake, or tsunami), or a terrible moral disaster (a corruption scandal, massive electoral fraud, etc.). But <em>opening with death and dead bodies</em> isn&rsquo;t enough. After the death toll, if my newscast is going to stay <em>punchy </em>and not <em>come down</em>, then the violence has to remain present&hellip; Then I can move on to an urgent summit to discuss death or on to various resounding statements about the <em>fight </em>against terrorism or the<em> fight</em> to end hunger or poverty, about the <em>fight </em>against organ-trafficking or other dirty, sinister human activities consonant with death. In any case, everything is a<em> fight</em> in this life, and we journalists have to have commerce with this fight. And that&rsquo;s not all&hellip; A true newscast, a <em>powerful </em>newscast capable of keeping the listener on the edge of his seat, also has to include an exciting/moving/titillating subject taken from the upper echelons of power&hellip; <em>The ideal </em>newscast should then move on to a morbid subject, perhaps about paedophilia or cloning, and as a <em>final touch</em> it will require a few words about the latest <em>progress </em>in euthanasia, which is to say, a person&rsquo;s natural right to a dignified, medically assisted death when he is suffering from an incurable illness. <br />
Of course, there are also days when the press agency wires don&rsquo;t supply enough dead bodies. For a journalist, these are black days, which seriously affect a newscast&rsquo;s upward trajectory. George calls them days of drought. Either the press agencies haven&rsquo;t been doing their job on such days, or the members of the human race have neglected to slaughter each other for a few hours. But a passing drought shouldn&rsquo;t punish audiences and shrink ratings. If we find ourselves confronted with a newscast that has a low percentage of horrors, we resort to the technique of evoking previous death tolls. Nothing can stop us from fighting the drought through commemoration. <br />
Let&rsquo;s suppose that today in the Middle East there have been only three deaths. Well, in that case we can remind the listener that since the beginning of the latest conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis, which is to say, in the last four years, the number of people killed has been 4,333, of which 3,314 have been Palestinians and 948 have been Israelis. With a little ingenuity we can formulate the news item as follows: <em>the latest terrorist attack in Israel has claimed three lives, bringing the death toll of the Intifada to 4,333, etc. etc</em>. And with a little more ingenuity and aplomb, we can make the sentence even more punchier by getting in the death toll at the outset: <em>The death toll of the four-year violent Intifada has risen to 4,333 after an attack carried out today by Palestinian terrorists in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, which claimed three victims&hellip;</em></p>
<p><br />
On days of drought we may therefore resort to this technique and repeat the death toll from a war, ethnic conflict, or a catastrophe over and over again, which allows us as journalists to keep the emotive potential of a newscast at a high level, even if the news materials for the day in question aren&rsquo;t up to the task. There are dozens of little tricks we can use. Let us suppose that today in Iraq only one American soldier has been killed. In itself, this information is weak and doesn&rsquo;t bring very much emotional content to the spectacle that is my newscast. Not unless I begin the item with an overall death toll. <em>An American soldier was killed today in Iraq</em> is a news item that is null, if I can put it like that&hellip; But if I say <em>another American soldier was killed today in Iraq, bringing the total toll of U.S. lives lost in the conflict to 1,012</em>, then everything changes. A four-digit number will cause every listener to sit up and take notice. Now I can sense I&rsquo;ve got my listener hooked. And because I&rsquo;ve got him hooked, I can quench his thirst for macabre items with another two or three sophisticated statistical pirouettes. I can tell him, for example, that <em>this means an average of three American soldiers have been killed every day since the U.S. invasion of Iraq, although this is lower than the rate during the Vietnam war, when an average of ten American soldiers were killed every day and significantly lower than the rate during the conflict in Algeria, when France lost an average of six soldiers a day&hellip;</em><br />
It&rsquo;s amazing, but when I utter all these words, I can sense how the man at the other end has pricked up his ears. He has grown as addicted to news as I am. He can&rsquo;t start the day without ingesting a dose of horror. And at night he can&rsquo;t go to bed unless he has immersed himself one last time in the world&rsquo;s misery. <br />
*<br />
Last decade, if you remember, ended with the planetary political and diplomatic scandal known as the Wikileaks affair. A computer genius managed to publish on his website hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables, forcing the world&rsquo;s politicians openly to admit what everybody else already suspected, namely everybody hates everybody else and our &ldquo;civilisation&rdquo; is nothing but a hypocritical form of ballet with rigid rules. The Wikileaks scandal is just the tip of the iceberg. The scenario of worldwide preventative disorder dreamt up by the team that dealt with the Wikileaks file is merely the beginning of a new era. Now that terrorism has used up its media power, our Agency is wagering for the next ten years on the preventative disorder produced by transparency. <br />
It&rsquo;s a promising field. If you have computer training and a good imagination, our Agency will welcome you with open arms. We are putting together the teams that will unleash the huge scandal of absolute transparency. Some of them are already in training. In the next ten years preventative disorder will be generated almost exclusively by the publication of every secret document in the world. The media machine will feed on diplomatic, economic, political, scientific, medical, technological and financial secrets, as well as others of a sexual or personal nature. Technically speaking, since every active person owns a computer, a mobile phone, one or more credit cards, a satellite GPS, and various other connexions, he can no longer have any secrets. In the West and the emerging countries, every active person (who works, makes telephone calls, earns money, pays taxes, has a social life, nurtures ambitions, and maintains a system of relations) is therefore a transparent person. In other words, somewhere, somebody knows everything about that person. Logical conclusion: we are embarking on an era of a new form of totalitarianism, the totalitarianism of transparency, to be precise. The secrets already stored about the planet&rsquo;s active people will be able to feed a huge quantity of scandals, polemics, enquiries, ruined careers, resignations, suicides, and assassinations for at least ten years. To sum up, this means that the media machine will have<em> food, food, food</em>. <br />
Yes, gentlemen of the press, and I speak to all those who have recently joined our Agency: we shall not be out of work. We shall have a huge amount of work to do. We shall break audience records. Billions of brains are at our disposal and all I want is that they should listen to us, that they should drink up our news and information, our expos&eacute;s and revelations. <br />
Total <em>transparency</em> will be the nightmare of the decade to come, and at the same time the most beautiful media story ever written.</p>

<p><em>All the Owls</em> is the novel of a deep friendship, one that breaks all the usual moulds: the friendship between a rebellious teenager from a small town in the mountains and a man forty-eight years his senior. Their relationship has little to do with any archetype of master and apprentice, for it unfolds under the star of absolute freedom, under the mirage of forests, windswept crags, and the laughter that heals wounds and sufferings. Above all else, at the heart of this friendship is the old man&rsquo;s knowledge of how to talk to owls in the twilight, far from the eyes and ears of other people, using a secret language of dozens of shrieks, whoops and whistles.</p>
<p><br />
The novel spans the period of time from January 2000 to October 2012. The account is in the first person singular, but in two continuously alternating voices. Luci describes how he grows closer to the man from Bucharest, on the one hand, and the adventurous, rebellious childhood of a young tearaway, on the other. In his escapades involving imaginary lost treasures, petty thefts, revenge, girls, and places in the mountain wilderness, the boy is almost always in the company of his dogs and a few close friends. The other voice is Emil&rsquo;s, but he speaks not of the present or the recent past, but of events of long ago, which he records in the pages of a notebook. Containing autobiographical and family stories, his memoirs cover more than half a century, recounting the dramas of the war and the communist period, and relate the thoughts of a man in his sixties and seventies about the world, chance, loneliness, and his peers.</p> <p>&nbsp;In the hall it was hot, very hot, but when you came in from outside, out of the frost, what struck you first was the brackish air and only afterwards the heat. Whenever I entered, my nostrils were always one step ahead of my eyes and ears. They would sniff that weak solution of steam, bleach, and seaweed, an odour I had never encountered anywhere else and which never faded. The hall had a mosaic floor and a high ceiling with a brown stain. There were lamps set into the curving walls. Inside, it never occurred to me that the smell must have seeped into the plaster as a signature of the place itself, but I confess that what did cross my mind was that the woman at the ticket counter, a fat woman with thin curly hair, dyed red, who wore flip-flops and a white cotton smock even in the depths of winter, had been infested by that brackish reek. She carried it around in the pores of her skin. She would never be able to get rid of it, not even if she immersed herself in liquid soap, not even if she splashed on a litre of perfume, not even if she scrubbed herself with the brush for scouring the floor. I said the very same thing to the lads, it must have been on our third trip and penultimate visit to the swimming pool of the Hotel Silvana, and Tudi whispered back that he wouldn&rsquo;t mind having a go at scrubbing her melon-sized tits with some sandpaper. We didn&rsquo;t buy tickets, because they were expensive and we had made an honest trade with Nelu Velescu, the boiler man, a neighbour of Niþuº&rsquo;s, who put in a good word for us with the cashier whenever we washed his car. In December he had bought himself a cherry-red Opel Astra, with seventy thousand kilometres on the clock, and he liked to see it gleaming so that you could see your face in it. Sometimes, in the afternoon, if it wasn&rsquo;t snowing, he would call us and arm us with rags, buckets of hot soapy water, a miniature vacuum cleaner, and a spray for the windows. He would stand over us, giving advice, supervising us. He would put us to work no matter how cold it might be. We granted his wish so that we would get on his good side, so that he would unbar the portal to the swimming pool for us. And the swimming pool, with its blue tiles, its starting blocks at the end of each lane, fifty metres long and twenty-five metres wide, according to Olympic regulations, was not like any weir or frothing mountain whirlpool, even if it was almost certainly filled straight from the Ghindura rill. I have no idea what they did with the stream water, how they filtered it, how they enchanted it, but the magic produced a different kind of water, neither too hot, nor too cold, clear and tranquil, without rocks, sand or rotting wood, of quite a depth, a domesticated, well-groomed water, a water that had learned good manners. To be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t all that crazy about it, although it allowed you to jump in head-first or feet-first, to do a flip, somersault, or corkscrew, it allowed you to gambol, race or leapfrog when there weren&rsquo;t very many other people, and above all it allowed you to play that mad game dreamt up by Sandu, which he called pearl and which was supposed to be like pearl diving in the South Seas: one of us would toss a stone high up in the air and when it dropped into the swimming pool we would dive in to fetch it. Naturally, the winner was the one who fished it out, but at the bottom of the pool we had to grope around like we were nearsighted or rather blind, because the water stung so badly that most of the time we kept our eyes shut. In our underwater skirmishes, as we elbowed and shoved each other, the water had an effect similar to red-hot chilli peppers. Sandu was able to turn the page however suited him, that is, he had but to mention the name of a semi-precious stone, rather than come up with a whole story about jewels and hidden treasure. In short, the game inflamed us like puppies scrapping over a measly bone, and what is more, it always used to annoy somebody, be it a pool attendant, be it a frightened mother, or be it some bloke with a potbelly and principles. It used to be sad when the fat woman from the ticket counter came to make an inspection and threatened never to let us back into the swimming pool ever again. After one of her tongue-lashings, we would turn into little angels: we would sit by the radiator at the edge of the pool and play cards or else we would slowly swim the breaststroke, one behind the other, like frogs. We were so well behaved that we would have amazed even ourselves if we could have looked on from a distance. Whatever we might have whispered about among ourselves didn&rsquo;t matter, given that nobody could hear us. In January and February, lessons at school used to finish before lunch and we would mope around the house for a while, we would let the winter indulge its whims, and then, at around half past five, as night fell, the time of day when the imagination is in full bloom and plans begin to hatch, we would go to the pool. It was in one such moment of inspiration, while we were taking a breather, whispering among ourselves, that the idea about the sauna slowly took shape. We had discovered it by chance the very first evening, as we were walking to the showers along the dimly lit corridor: as we were passing, a door had opened and a blast of heat had hit us, as if from an oven. In the two seconds it took for some puny bloke to slip outside, I caught a glimpse of wooden benches with backrests and a fine mist, like the steam from a cauldron of soup. In that soup, it seemed to me, there had been floating three soft, plump dumplings in dark bathing suits. To Marcel, strangely enough, the bodies prone on the benches had looked like meatballs dusted with flour but yet to be deep-fried, while Niþuº had seen them as chicken legs with fat-speckled skin laid out on a griddle. In any case, we waited for the women to come out and then watched them as they went away. They seemed groggy. They shuffled their slippered feet and occasionally heaved a sigh. Once we were sure that nobody was coming down the corridor, we stepped across the threshold into the cauldron of soup. I had never experienced such suffocation or such a wilting feeling in my life. Even a crowded bus in summer would have been cool in comparison with that claggy heat. We flopped down wherever the fancy took us and lay there for what might have been an eternity or five minutes, I no longer know how long, and then ran to the pool and dived in, looking not for pearls but relief. As we were about to leave, having wrapped ourselves snugly in our winter coats and pulled our hats down over our ears, Gabi suddenly realised he had forgotten his towel and dashed back to fetch it. We waited for him outside, bickering about whether the moon was full or not, and shortly afterwards he appeared, with a broad smile on his face and the news that the fat woman in the flip-flops and white cotton smock, thinking she was all by herself, had just entered the sauna. We all laughed, in a chorus of six voices. We pictured the scene down to the detail of her bottom sizzling and melting in the steam. Then we wished her hale and farewell, because in the end she was our benefactress and it wasn&rsquo;t fitting that we should speak ill of her like that. Later, that all changed, however. Six weeks is a huge, vast stretch of time, during which we washed Nelu Velescu&rsquo;s car another three times, although the snow did not let up, blizzards raged and the north wind blew. We wormed our way into his confidence, since he was the canny craftsman who tended the main boiler. We wheedled all his secrets out of him, discovering willy-nilly all kinds odd details, such as how to fire up that huge piece of machinery, how to keep the pressure up, how to air the pipes in the hotel, how to keep the water in the pool at a steady temperature of twenty-seven degrees, and countless other assorted boring information, reeled off by a boring man. But among all those trifles and tedious explanations, he gave away what we were hoping he would give away, namely that the fat woman had a soft spot for him and how to heat the sauna until it was as hot as the boiler of a steam locomotive. The first revelation was a let-down: with her dyed-red hair curled in rollers, the woman who dispensed tickets for the pool was not the stoker&rsquo;s mistress, but merely a married cousin of his, who lived in one of the housing blocks. But the second piece of information fit hand in glove, given it was February and, what with the frosts that had descended upon the town, any extra glove was welcome. We knew that in one corner of that little room where people went to sweat their hearts out there was a square structure as big as a barrel, but what we hadn&rsquo;t suspected was that within the housing there were spiral elements that glowed like the embers of a beech wood fire. And those spirals, as old man Nelu informed us, heated the stones in the sauna to very high temperatures, the same as if they had been kept in a stove for hours and hours. When you poured water on them, it evaporated instantly, turning into a pale mist, but not like the mists that envelop the mountains, rising from the valleys and hollows. When you learn something, it&rsquo;s important to learn it thoroughly, in every detail and nuance, otherwise everything will come to nought. But even if every time we went to the swimming pool we kept a close watch out of the corner of our eye on she-who-must-be-obeyed lest we unwittingly enrage her, even if we swallowed a mass of reproaches and ill humours, there was still one detail that we missed, and namely that, the same as good fortune can spring from the soil or a dry stone, so too can ill fortune spring from an almost deserted swimming pool. From the part opposite the windows, to be precise. It was late February. We had washed the cherry-red Opel for the fourth time the day before and we were playing pearl as usual. We were fighting each other like madmen for a limestone pebble, we were also swearing our lungs out, when all of a sudden a fine rain started to patter down on us, like an autumn drizzle, but without there being any holes in the roof. A brunette with long nails, aged around forty, was standing at the edge of the pool about a metre away from us, one hand on her hip, the other in the air, index finger wagging, sprinkling that rain, a dismal shower whose droplets were meant to convey to us that she had come there to relax, not to get high blood pressure, that she had already told us to pipe down and we hadn&rsquo;t, that her head was now throbbing and we had ruined all her enjoyment. Then she turned her back on us, like a cloudburst, and stormed off to the ticket booth. To make matters worse, the brunette was not just any brunette, but a nursery school teacher, and not just any nursery school teacher, but the one who taught the middle group at the nursery school by the housing blocks. And one of the pupils in the middle group of that nursery school in that insufferable neighbourhood was none other than the youngest boy of the fat woman in the white smock. It was the end of an epoch. Barking and scowling, as hard-hearted as a sergeant major, the fat woman sent us to the locker room to get dressed and swore that we would never set foot there again, not even if she were run over by a tram. In our town there were no tramlines, tram stations, tramcars, or tram drivers, but none of that mattered. We went to the locker room in silence, our heads bowed, as if we were being sent to the scaffold or off to war. But first we asked a bloke what time it was and he said it was a quarter to eight, which meant it was not long until closing time. We entered the showers and slowly soaped and rinsed ourselves. Then we towelled ourselves without haste and dawdled as we put on our socks, vests, and the rest of our clothes. We bided our time, keeping a sharp ear on every sound and movement from the corridor. Gabi slipped into the sauna like a shadow and swiped the two-litre pitcher. We all took turns piddling in it until it was full to the brim and then Gabi took it back and placed it between the water bucket and that square contraption as big as a barrel, whose housing contained the red-hot spiral elements. Anyway, when it&rsquo;s winter, a person has to wear lots of pullovers and it takes him quite a while to turn them the right side out, to pick all the bits of fluff off them, and to make sure they&rsquo;re not on back to front. We continued to get dressed in silence &ndash; after all, we had no reason to hurry &ndash; until we heard the door of the sauna creak. It was the brunette with the red nails, looking forward to some relaxation. For a while the silence buzzed deafeningly, as if it were talking to itself, and then we heard a piercing scream followed by a thud. White flip-flops flapped down the corridor, the door creaked once more, and then came the deluge, although not even now was there any hole in the roof. The fat woman was thundering and lightening. She might even have been capable of raining hailstones. And above the stormy blasts there was a dreadful stench of piss. The piss of each and every one of us.</p>

6 1 <p>We are dealing here with an extraordinary novel, one of the few that I can calmly recommend for export. Because it is incredibly simple to read. Because it is written with astonishing lightness, because it has no pretensions to be a fresco of the Ceausescu epoch or of the 1990s. It is an examination, humane and at the same time cold, of a typically Central&#8209;European state of mind.&rdquo;</p> C. ROGOZANU Suplimentul de cultura
7 1 <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Communist Biddy&nbsp;!, the latest novel by the excellent Dan Lungu, written in the form of the confession of Emilia Apostoae, formerly employed at a metalwork factory, is probably the best novel about nostalgia for life under communism. <br />
A realist&#8209;minimalist novel of astonishing humour, true in all its situations and dialogue, a book full of humour, but, above all, full of bitterness, the derisory, the absurd&hellip;&rdquo;</p> Marius Chivu Dilema Veche
8 1 <p>&ldquo;One cannot help but feel sympathy for this woman who recounts her life and ultimately draws the correct conclusion about communism. All things considered, Dan Lungu has written an excellent novel, one that will enjoy an outstanding career, not only in Romania.&rdquo;</p> Stefan Agopian Academia Catavencu
9 1 <p>&ldquo;This novel will be read breathlessly by those nostalgic for the old regime, as well as by young people for whom Ceausescu is nothing but a character in commercials.&rdquo;</p> Daniel Cristea-Enache Cultura
10 1 <p>&ldquo;Under the confessional pretext lies concealed a very good novel, a novel of copious humour, written in the first person, on one of the most topical of subjects&nbsp;: the (im)possibility of reconciling the memories of a happy childhood and youth with a recognition of the abjection of communism.&rdquo;</p> Mihaela Ursa Apostrof
11 7 <p><i><b>&ldquo;There is no way you could not like it. You have to like it&nbsp;!&rdquo;</b></i></p> Mihai Iovanel Cultura
12 7 <p>&ldquo;I assure you that you won&rsquo;t have read anything like The B&#259;iu&#539; Alley Lads&nbsp;! And not just because the novel has been written by four hands, by two brothers, but also because it is very rare to find someone who has written about childhood with so much style, winningly blending fantasy with nostalgia and humour.&rdquo;</p> Marius Chivu Romania Liber&#259;
13 7 <p>&ldquo;Paradise exists &ndash; it was invented by two brothers somewhere on Baiut Alley. This book by brothers Matei and Filip Florian delicately and innocently skirts a gloomy epoch. Not because any political annulment of the regime is part of their candid concerns, but because the Ceausescus, secret police informers in their block, and ideologies are absolutely secondary to the story. They are far from possessing the power of a Steaua&#8209;Dynamo match, or a neighbourhood game of football where defeat ends in tears and sobs.&rdquo;</p> Florentina Ciuverca Evenimentul Zilei
14 7 <p>&ldquo;<i>The Baiut Alley Lads</i> is not a book about &lsquo;today&rsquo;s world&rsquo;, but a lucid submersion in the magic of an intimate past. Solidary over time, the two cavalier&#8209;brothers from Baiut compose with humour and ironic delicacy a fresh and charming book about the everyday miracle of their childhood during the Ceausescu regime, one of the most beautiful &lsquo;young books&rsquo; to have been published in Romania in recent years.&rdquo;</p> Paul Cernat Bucurestiul Cultural
15 7 <p>&ldquo;The Florian brothers&rsquo; book remains one of the most convincing novels about communism.&rdquo;</p> Andrei Terian Cultura
100 38 <p>&ldquo;Petru Cimpoe&#351;u must have had a lot of patience to have waited until what was his due &ndash; at least since the discreet publication of The Tale of the Great Brigand in 2000 &ndash; was finally recognised&nbsp;: the fact that he is one of the most important prose writers of the 1980s generation.&rdquo;</p> Bogdan CRE&#354;U
101 38 <p>&ldquo;The volume Nine Old Prose Pieces. Illicit Fictions opens a long-ranging discussion regarding the avatars of eighties-ist prose and the relation, in hindsight, of the eighties-ists themselves to this type of writing.&rdquo;</p> Adina DINI&#354;OIU
102 38 <p>&ldquo;The Petru Cimpoe&#351;u of the short stories is more lively, more impulsive, less technical, but also more direct than the author of the elaborate novels. The pleasure of narrative is more in evidence and is conveyed to the reader in the form of the joy of reading. Illicit Fictions are games of maturity which the novelist composes as recreation after having become a perfect master of his craft.&rdquo;</p> Horia GÂRBEA
104 39 <p>&ldquo;The stories take us into a strange world of the imagination which flirts with but never slips into the fantastic, preserving to the very end a realist tension. Ecovoiu writes sparingly, his sentences are clipped, but in spite of the &lsquo;fragmented&rsquo; text the feeling is one of solidity and exhaustiveness.&rdquo;</p> Ciprian M&#258;CE&#350;ARU
105 39 <p>&ldquo;Already an old book, because almost all the texts were written before 1989, although they are not at all stale. Their merit might be the lack of &lsquo;realist meat&rsquo;, which has excellently preserved the material. Strange, cruel, rhythmic and laden with negative energy, these prose pieces brutally make room for themselves in the corpus of today&rsquo;s literature, conjoining it without remainder to the anguishes of time.&rdquo;</p> Tatiana RADU
106 39 <p>&ldquo;The strangeness, ingeniousness and parabolic dimension of Alexandru Ecovoiu&rsquo;s stories situates the author among the progeny of the South-American prose writers, among whom he has most in common with Borges and Bioy Casares, although the influence is not one that is direct. It is rare for the characters to have names &ndash; they are mostly designated generically &ndash; and they are solitary (&lsquo;you construct solitude,&rsquo; &lsquo;solitude is advantageous to you,&rsquo; as two meta-narratorial sentences assert), their past is nebulous, they bear a mysterious aura, bizarre things happen to them.&rdquo;</p> Marius CHIVU
107 39 <p>&ldquo;The stories in this collection are a demonstration of stylistic virtuosity, and many are at the limits of the prose poem.&rdquo;</p> Tudorel URIAN
109 44 <p>&ldquo;An extraordinary book.&ldquo;</p> The New Yorker
110 44 <p>&ldquo;[Norman Manea&rsquo;s] vision of totalitarianism is closer to Kafka&rsquo;s cloudy menace, universal yet internalized, than to Orwell&rsquo;s brass tacks.&rdquo;</p>
<br /> The New York Times
111 44 <p>&ldquo;The miracle of language. A genius for the word continually breaks through the thickets of the phrase.&rdquo;</p> Die Zeit
520 181 <p><em>&rdquo;he Book of Perilous Dishes</em> has all that it takes to make a captivating story: a good dose of fantasy, an epic thread pleated together with the sure hand of a story-teller who knows how to ensnare you, an atmosphere so powerful that it stays with you long after you have put the book down, and, last but not least, a subtext that sends you towards the mysteries of the World and of Literature. As its events unfold&mdash;on the borderline between magic and the fantastic&mdash;in the setting of a picturesque Bucharest of around the year 1800 (a pretext, in fact, for a narrative that transcends the specifics of any documentable historical framework), <em>The Book of Perilous Dishes</em> traces, as if in a dream, the limits of a fictional universe in which, as in some alchemist&rsquo;s alembic, the deceptive substances of the real are mixed in suitable doses with those, so clearly evident, of an unreality (or surreality) that breaks through into the midst of the everyday. Merchants, sorcerers, spiritists, cooks of the Princely Court, lovers, haughty young ladies, ambassadors from diverse lands, mercenaries, officials of the Sublime Porte, princes in exile and princes newly enthroned, schemers of all sorts, revolutionaries, Bonapartists, tricksters, and envoys of Sator populate the carnivalesque space of this novel of fantasy, whose deeper levels lead far into the distance, towards worlds we could scarcely imagine.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p> Bianca BURTA-CERNAT
521 183 <p>&nbsp;&rdquo;This is the novel of a sacrificed generation, that of the transition from communism to democracy, and is also one of the first novels dedicated to Bucharest after the Revolution.&rdquo;</p> Observatorul cultural
522 183 <p>&rdquo;Bogdan Stanescu is one of the most talented writers of the new literary generation in his country. Author of excellent books of poetry, prose and criticism he represents the best of the new post-communist spiritual climate in today&rsquo;s Eastern Europe.  <br />
His Kaspar Hauser (nicknamed <em>Bobitza</em> - <em>berry</em>) confronts a difficult childhood and adolescence in the periphery of Bucharest, among a broken family, a group of violent companions, young, brutal outsiders and his own confused solitude. In the second part of this ambitious novel (made of connected short and longer stories) we find him in a lucid transition towards a sceptical but still reasonable maturity, finally ready to accept his part in the tense and often traumatic pressure of our time. The brilliant modulations and potential of a dynamic, often picturesque style adds vitality, charm and mystery to the narrative.<br />
A subtle and profound coming of age book, astute and colourful, written with passion and intelligence, highly significant for the current disturbing and often overwhelming time of re-evaluations and change.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> NORMAN MANEA
523 184 <p>&ldquo;Take two lovers eager to rediscover themselves and send them to an exotic destination. Not a classic one, like Bali, the Maldives or Dubai, but one that lies where Europe and Asia meet. There haven&rsquo;t been many advertisements for the lands inhabited by the Buddhist Mongols of Kalmykia (see the film The Gulls), and not much has been said about Dumas&rsquo;s journey to the Caucasus, which is the obsession of one of the characters. And so, in the novel Perfumed Panthers, which is structured like a road trip, writer Dan Alexe reveals countless details about the customs, culture, tragedies, and inflamed conflicts of the lands by the Caspian Sea, the regions where Volga&rsquo;s Delta meets the steppe and the tracts once crossed by the caravans that took the Silk Road.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> Adriana GIONEA
524 184 <p>&ldquo;Having set off &lsquo;to discover the Islam of the snows and icy crevasses, over which the Caucasian horseman makes his steed leap after blindfolding it to hide the chasm,&rsquo; Dan Alexe looks deep into the chasm of the human soul, of the mountain peoples, of (absolute and local) power, and in this way makes the chasm look him straight in the eye. An abyssal novel, Perfumed Panthers!&rdquo;</p> Emilian GALAICU-P&#258;UN
525 186 <p>&ldquo;Transgressing Toma&rsquo;s war experience, the novel <em>Shrapnel</em> confronts us, as if in a mirror, with the image of a devastated people, who have either left the country or resigned themselves to the place of their birth, a people too often overwhelmed by sufferings of every kind, accustomed to them, abandoned by a state on the verge of collapse, a people eaten away by poverty, of course, but also above all by uncertainties to do with its national identity&#8239;.&#8239;.&#8239;. From the antechamber of death in Afghanistan to the native village that has become a place where nothing happens, Toma is a simple man, in whom a mindless, atrocious History has left its shrapnel, not only in one of his legs, but also in his mind. In short, a smaller history, part of the wider history of a post-communist country, itself part of a history wider still, that of Eastern Europe, adrift as it has never been before.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> Serenela GHITEANU
526 186 <p>&ldquo;This novel, which lets nothing escape its view, be it poetry, metaphor, or humour is one of the best that Polirom has published since it started promoting contemporary Romanian literature. I would say it is memorable, but I&rsquo;m worried lest some think I&rsquo;m being excessive in my praise. My copy is full of yellow post-it notes marking the exceptional passages. I hope you take my recommendation and try <em>Shrapnel</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> Constantin PISTEA
527 187 <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Joking aside, <em>The Strange and Endearing Life of Prita Barsacu</em>, Iulian Bocai&rsquo;s debut (mini-)novel, is a sensational book (&hellip;) Bocai&rsquo;s novel is a bildungsroman (or rather a &ldquo;bildungsnovella&rdquo;, as the title page specifies), although one of savage realism. Of course, it has an obvious meta- component, an implicit irony that comes from the combination of an &lsquo;elevated&rsquo;, television documentary-like narrative voice with lowly human subject matter: the early years of Prita Barsacu, the scion of a poor and scattered family, who lives in a village near a hydroelectric plant on the Olt River. What fills this life can be divined at least in part: physical and mental abuse at home and school, abject poverty, a toxic multilateral domestic setting, with an alcoholic father, a mentally ill mother, one criminal brother, one baker brother. N.B.: in the social context of the book, being a baker is worse than being a brute, inasmuch as baking is overly feminine, while brutality betokens masculinity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> Mihai IOVANEL
528 187 <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Iulian Bocai, who won the 2018 Polirom debut competition. I have described his book and read it with increasing curiosity, especially since his<em> bildungsnovella</em> gripped me from the very first page. From the short biographical note on the front inside flap of the book, I learn no more than that he was born in Oltenia in 1986, studied literature at Bucharest University, is working on a PhD thesis, and from time to time translates from English, French and German. (&hellip;) But in any case, with the tale of Prita Barsacu, Iulian Bocai has entered the world of the major Romanian novel from his very debut.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> Cristian TEODORESCU
529 188 <p>&ldquo;Our whole life is a theatre of the absurd, while we are puppets impaled on the spears of dark humour. This would be the introduction demanded by the latest novel by Bessarabian author Iulian Ciocan. A wonderful satire, written with vigilant care and rigour, but imbued with the everyday realism of the Republic of Moldavia, <em>The Queen of Hearts</em> wins you over from its very first pages. You can&rsquo;t put it down! You read it while you&rsquo;re drinking your morning coffee and it accompanies you on your way to work (in my case, a forty-minute journey, but which the novel makes delightful).&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> Corina MOISEI

<p class="MsoNormal">Main office: Ia&#351;i, 4 Carol I Boulevard, 4th floor, P.O. BOX 266. Tel.: 0232.214.100, 0232.214.111. Fax: 0232.214.111, office@polirom.ro<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p><br />
</o:p>&rdquo;Thanks to Polirom, literature in Romania today is much more than just a row of books on a shelf or a salon pastime. Contemporary literature is alive, is read with interest, stirs public debate, and creates currents of feeling and opinion. What is certain is that in Romania it is no longer possible to write or read literature in the same way as fifteen years ago. Not only the more intense rhythm of life but also a vital connection to the realities of the day oblige contemporary writers to problematise the world around them, from the political baggage of their personal memory to the miracles of everyday life, from sub&#8209;humanity to postmodernism. More recently, it has also been literature that has succeeded in imprinting an image of Romania&rsquo;s identity abroad. The national and international prizes won by Romanian authors, the numerous book fairs at which Polirom has taken part (Frankfurt, Leipzig, Lille, Zurich, Basle, Berne), and also numerous publications abroad, whether already in print or in press, have confirmed not only individual authors but also an entire literary wave.&rdquo; (Doris Mironescu)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&rdquo;Besides this appealing diversity, the indisputable worth of the writers included in Polirom&rsquo;s catalogues ought to make us confident, even optimistic, as to the response our literature deserves to produce abroad, a literature which for far too long was written exclusively by poets and critics, and was thus inevitably relegated to a minor status, that of a restricted, local, mimetic phenomenon. It is something well known, something always repeated as a wearisome reproach, that since the beginnings of our timid synchronisation with the West, prose (or the novel, to be more precise) has been our sole chance, the only form of expression whereby we have been capable of stirring the interest of foreign audiences in lands with high cultural pedigrees. And whereas in the past we have diligently imitated, so as to keep in step and not embarrass ourselves, today we are exporting our own literary products of the finest quality.&rdquo; (Antonio Patra&#351;)</p>
