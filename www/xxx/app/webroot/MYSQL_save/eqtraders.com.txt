1 About EQTC Welcome to EQTC! <!--image:traders.jpg-->Welcome!<p>EQTraders Corner (EQTC) was created at the launch of EQ by a stubborn redhead named Niami DenMother (aka 'Mum), in an attempt to make sense of the often-bewildering world of EverQuest tradeskills. </p>
<p>Since it was launched in March 1999, there have been many changes to tradeskills as well as to this website. We've gone from being run on 'Mum's personal AOL webspace to a several million hits per month website and message board setup. We've gone from flat files tracking a few recipes and some vendor and mob drop information to multiple database tables tracking thousands of recipes, mobs, drops and so forth.</p>
<p>One thing hasn't changed, though. We're still privately owned and run by 'Mum (with the technical help of her husband and some phenomenal volunteer staff, led by Aanuvane). Why is this point important? It means that this is basically a labor of love. It's not some huge profit-making site. There is no premium membership. There are no annoying popups. There is no begging in your mailbox asking you to help keep us running. There's just this dedicated staff trying to make sure that tradeskill information is freely available to all and sundry.</p>
<p>We finally broke down and added targeted banner ads to the sites to help pay for them. Just a little extra space taken at the top/bottom of the page. Easy to ignore if you want. {grins}  Running the two sites is a pretty time-consuming, and bandwidth-consuming process these days, and donations alone generally don't do the trick.</p>
<p>We do try, very hard, to ensure that the ads that go through block things like plat sales sites and suchforth, but once in a while one slips through our filters. If you see any ad of questionable legality, please post in our forums so we can get it blocked ASAP.</p>
<p>Please be aware that we do strongly monitor and moderate our message boards, and make sure to read the posts in the Visitor's Corner section of the forums before posting. While the tradeskill information on the site is freely available to all, we DO enforce rules of conduct on those posting to the message boards, and we can/will ban folks from posting if they can't accept our "our house, our rules" decision for the forums. We've seen too many message board forums turn into total chaos, and we're not going to let it happen here - especially now that we have SOE devs regularly stopping in to check on things, based on our reputation for relative sanity. ;)</p>

190 about_pricing Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Merchant Pricing, but were Afraid to Ask <i>by Balidil Anla'shok</i><p>
            <p align="left"><b>Charisma and Faction</b></p>
            <p align="left">As far as vendor prices are concerned, factions can
              be broken up into three categories. Dubious or worse, apprehensive,
              and indifferent or better. If your faction with the merchant is
              dubious or worse, of course, the merchant simply won't sell to you
              (I have something here that %Rs use..let me see...it's the EXIT,
              now get LOST!). If you're
              at apprehensive, the merchant will sell to you, but is going to
              charge you an arm and a leg unless you can get your charisma WAY
              up there. Lastly, any faction indifferent or better will get
              exactly the same prices for the same charisma. It doesn't matter if
              you're ally or sneaking and indifferent. <br>
              There are several crucial charisma numbers to shoot for. Key to
              this is that, whether your faction is apprehensive or indifferent
              or better, there's a stretch from 61 or 62 to 76 or 77 (I haven't
              been able to get a gear combination that gives any of my characters
              either 61 or 76 charisma yet, unfortunately) that gives
              exactly the same prices.  So, if you can get your charisma up to
              62, don't bother getting any more charisma boosters until you can
              get enough to get you to 76. However, when you do get to 76,
              the prices will suddenly drop by about 6%, instead of the 0.5%
              you get for most individual points of charisma. <br>
              Better known is the "magic number" of charisma, 104. This is the
              point at which indifferent or better merchants will give you the
              best price they're ever going to give you. This price seems to be
              based on 1.05 times a "actual value" that you will never see used,
              but is only directly known by the server. For instance, many gem
              and metal prices are clearly based on this. And, if you notice the
              prices at which the vendor will buy such things back from you,
              although it looks like a very irregular number, for instance 95pp
              2gp 3sp 8cp for a bar of platinum or a sapphire, that just happens
              to be 100pp divided by 1.05. <br>
              The last and highest number to shoot for is 132. This is the
              charisma at which you can normally get the cheapest prices even
              with apprehensive faction.</p>

            <p align="left"><b>"Greedy" Merchants</b></p>

            </ul>

            <p align="left"><b>The Pricing Roller Coaster</b></p>
            <p align="left">When many players have been buying from or selling to
              a merchant, he seems to get it into his head that "Hey, I'm so
              popular, I can charge better prices now!". Unfortunately, "better" in
              this context means "better for the vendor". I'm still carrying out
              research on this issue, but merchants that will normally give best
              prices at 104 charisma and indifferent faction can go at least as
              high as needing 134 charisma to get best prices, even with ally
              faction. It seems that, with less charisma than that needed for
              best prices, a set amount is added to the price you would normally
              get, i.e. whether your charisma is 120 or 50, a vendor might add
              3sp to the price you would pay from a vendor who hasn't been getting
              so much action. The actual amount can vary widely. <br>
	      This is particularly noticeable on merchants in very busy areas, for 
	      instance vendors located in or right at the entrance to newbie areas, 
	      or those in banks. In these cases, it's almost impossible to 
	      distinguish a "greedy" merchant from a merely "opportunistic" 
	      merchant. </p>

            <p align="left"><b>Stacking and Prices</b></p>
            <p align="left">When buying or selling items by the stack, the cost can
              be a bit more precise than the single item cost times 20. This can go
              either way, making it more or less efficient to buy or sell by the
              stack. One classic example is water, and other common items that are
              bought for 1sp. Since the real cost is 1sp and 1/2cp, even though the
              per item cost is rounded off to 1sp, when you buy a whole stack at
              once you pay 2gp 1sp, a whole 1sp more than buying them one by one. 
              On the other hand, with my Iksar's rather low charisma, he gets
              shuriken for 1sp 3cp each, but if he buys a stack, he only pays
              2gp 5sp 9cp, and saves a whole copper! <br>
              In general, to the best of my knowledge, this can never make more
              of a difference than 1sp per stack. So I usually don't bother with
              it myself, and just buy my water etc. by the stack. 2005-09-12 11:23:48 2003-06-15 07:27:25 Verdandi Board Goddess 0 0 2005-09-12 11:22:12 Verdandi Board Goddess

11 Alchemy - FAQ Alchemy Frequently Asked Questions <p><i>This FAQ originated on the now-closed Belgar's Alchemy site.  It has been updated and adapted here with permission.</i></p>

<p class="headers">Frequently Asked Questions</p>
<p>
<b>Who can make potions with alchemy?</b>
</p>
<blockquote> <p>Alchemy is a shaman-only skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>When can I start working on alchemy?</b>
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
You can start once your shaman is level 25.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Is there a skill cap on alchemy?</b>
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
No, but there used to be.  As of the Dragons of Norrath expansion, you can take alchemy all the way to 300 skill at level 25.  Given the cost of ingredients, this would be extremely hard without considerable help; still, it is possible.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Where can I buy herbs?</b></p>

<blockquote> <p>See our <a href="<!--server:x-->sources/source_trade_page.php?st=Alchemy&menustr=110020000000">Herb Vendors</a> guide for a complete list of known herb vendors throughout Norrath.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Where do I find the recipes for known alchemy potions?</b></p>

<blockquote> <p>See our <a href="<!--server:x-->recipes/recipe_page.php?article=29&rsa=Alchemy&sb=item&sub=&menustr=080010000000">Alchemy Recipes</a> pages for detailed recipes and effects.</p> </blockquote>

<p><b>What are the best potions to make in order to increase my alchemy skill?</b></p>

<blockquote><p>We're working on revising this answer, as it's changed considerably since the last edit.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>What attribute has the greatest effect on alchemy success rates and skill increases?</b></p>

<blockquote> <p>Wisdom. </p>
<p>See our guide on <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=g8&menustr=040010000000">Beginning Alchemy</a> for more information.</p> </blockquote>

<p><b>Where do I find the various dropped ingredients used for certain alchemy potions?</b></p>
<blockquote> <p>Search for the item or click on it in a recipe.  Part of the item detail is the known sources, including what can drop it and where it is foraged.  If you cannot yet kill the kind of creature that drops an ingredient, or cannot easily get to them, try checking vendors near those creatures to see if players have sold some off. </p> </blockquote>

<p><b>What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?</b></p>

<blockquote><p>An intriguing and age-old question that is highly dependent upon whether one is speaking of the African swallow, or the European swallow. See Monty Python's "The Search for the Holy Grail" for further details.</p></blockquote> 2006-09-18 10:48:26 2003-05-14 01:20:02 Verdandi Board Goddess 0 1 2010-12-06 08:27:14 EQTC Editor Aanuvane
8 Alchemy - Getting Started Alchemy: Getting Started <p><i>This guide originated on the now-closed Belgar's Alchemy site. It has been adapted and updated here with permission.</i></p>

<p>So you wanna make potions for fun and profit? Well, maybe just for fun anyway. Here's a suggested step by step way to get your new skill started.</p>

<p class="headers">The Skill Cap:</p>

<p>The only restrictions on alchemy are that only shamans can do it, and they must be level 25 to start.  Alchemy <i>used to</i> also be capped at five points of skill per level.  That has changed, so that a shaman at level 25 can go all the way to 300 skill.</p>

<p>The trainer at any shaman guild will allow you to put 21 initial practice points into alchemy skill, but no more. This is true whether or not you actually put any training points in before 21.  Skill above that level must be obtained "in the field", which means to get further skill increases above 21 you will need to attempt to make potions. So unless you'd prefer to spend considerable time and/or plat getting there the hard way, I recommend saving 21 guild practice points to start your alchemy off. </p>

<p class="headers"> The Influence of Stats:</p> 

<p>Originally the popular theory was that intelligence helped you gain skill faster, while wisdom helped you successfully create items more often. <b>This is incorrect.</b>  For alchemy, it is either the highest of your intelligence or your wisdom that determines how quickly your skill improves.  Given that shamans need wisdom for our spell casting, and have no use for intelligence whatsoever, you can ignore intelligence and focus on wisdom.</p>

<p>Only your skill (and certain AA abilities), and not any stat, determines how often you succeed at making something.   For more on this, see the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=19">Stats and Tradeskills FAQ</a>. </p>

<p class="headers">New to Tradeskills?</p> 

<p>The basic system of tradeskills is that you have certain ingredients which are combined in a certain tradeskill container.  For example, to make a Distillate of Alacrity I, get one Arnworth, five small vials and a medicine bag.  When you first open the medicine bag, it may open to a window that looks just like any other container, except with a Combine button in addition to the Done button.  Or, it may be more complex, with a search interface and buttons for "favorite recipes" and an Experiment button.  That is the recipe book, which lets you create things more quickly, by automatically combining the right ingredients when you select that recipe in the "book".  The catch is that not all recipes are available in your recipe book to start.  Some of them you will have to make once to learn them, after which they will be in your recipe book.</p>

<p>So if you want to use the recipe book to make a Distillate of Alacrity I, search for Distillate of Alacrity.  Then select it in the result list box and hit Combine.  It will automatically find the right six ingredients in your inventory and attempt the combine for you.</p>

<p>If you would rather use the experiment mode, or are attempting a recipe that you need to learn first, open the container in experiment mode and put the five ingredients in.  Remember that multiple quanties of the same item must be placed into each slot unstacked in order to perform the combine.  Click combine to attempt the combine.</p>

<p>Whichever way you choose to attempt your combine, you will receive one of five possible messages and success/failure outcome combinations</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>a) You fail and receive a message indicating <u>you do not have the skill</u> to make that potion. (This message is the same when you fail, regardless of your actual skill relative to the recipe difficulty.)</p>
<p>b) You will fail but receive a message indicating <u>your skill in alchemy has increased</u>. (One of the best messages!)</p>
<p>c) You will succeed> in making the potion and receive a message indicating <u>you have created something new</u>, but receive no indication of whether the potion is trivial.  (That means it is not trivial yet.)</p>
<p>d) You will succeed> in making the potion and receive a message indicating <u>your skill in alchemy has increased</u>. (Twice as good!)</p>
<p>e) You will succeed in making the potion and receive a message indicating that <u>you can no longer advance in skill from making this item</u>.  (That means that recipe is trivial to you, so that you can no longer improve your skill by making it.)</p>

9 Alchemy - History Alchemy: A Not-so-Brief History <p class="headers">by Verdandi Snowblood</p>
            
<p>In the beginning, there were two kinds of herb vendors. One was found in some shaman cities and had a set of herbs that each could be combined with a different dropped item, like a cyclops eye or undead froglok tongue. The other type of vendor was the gypsies, found in gypsy camps across Antonica. They had a different, smaller set of herbs that each also could be combined with a different kind of dropped giant toe to make other potions.</p>

<p>However, shaman guild trainers across Norrath refused to train their pupils in the fine art of alchemy. It was well nigh a year before they received their instructions from The Powers That Be and began to teach us the fundamentals of alchemy.  The herbs and potions at the time were extremely expensive and of very limited usefulness. (One of them with an herb cost of more than 30pp and requiring a drop from the Plane of Hate had the tremendous effect of Endure Magic.) Therefore, when our guildmasters were fixed so that we could train, our line of potions available was completely replaced with new ones. This change is commonly called the Revamp.</p>

<p>All of the old shaman city vendor herbs were removed entirely, effectively removing access to those potions. Only the gypsy vendors remained and their potions continued to work. In the cities, the old herb vendors were replaced by a whole new set of herbs that took up two vendors because there were so many. These are the herbs that are most familiar to folks nowadays, the ones that can make sow potions and invis to undead potions. For these potions, no dropped component is required, they are made entirely via herbs bought from the vendors.</p>

<p>Thus the world remained, with Revamp Alchemy and Gypsy Alchemy composing almost the entire line of alchemy available. During the Revamp era we were granted the ability to create dyes for use in tinting fine plate armor. However, as these can only be applied to that single type of armor, they are not widely used.</p>

<p>With the advent of Luclin two additional sets of potions were added to a shaman's menu. First was a whole new set of potions with brand new effects. These include the mana potions and grow potion. These herbs are available in a few different places, all in Luclin. The other set of potions...well, shamans exploring Shar Vahl came across these strange herbs with naggingly familiar names...until it hit them. Old Alchemy. Once again available, this time in Shar Vahl, are the herbs used to make potions from the old, original, pre-revamp alchemy. These are the ones that required the drops like cyclops eyes and undead froglok tongues. </p>

<p>The discovery of the Plane of Knowledge brought only a single additional recipe for shamans, Quintessence of Knowledge, used as a reagent for a couple new items available in the new Planes. Some time after we ventured into the new Planes, we also learned to create the Grandmaster's Medicine Bag as a trophy of our accomplishments and useful reward for our hard work.</p>

<p>Most recently, the Ykesha brought us a diverse wealth of additional potions. Some of these grant the illusion of a different race, some grant new focus effects, some allow the creation of dyes effective on any armor, and some bring new effects similar to those we had in previous lines of alchemy, including gating to one's bind spot or group shrink. Some of these use vendor ingredients found only in the Ykesha zones, some require dropped ingredients, some require herbs from Revamp alchemy, and some require a combination of all these sources. Truly a mixed bag.</p>

<p>The Lost Dungeons of Norrath, or LDoN, introduced five new alchemy potions.  Three of them are the first group effect potions.  Another is the first shaman-made invisibility potion, allowing us to compete with the invisibility potion sold by vendors since the beginning.  The fifth is the guktan illusion potion, complementing the introduction of the playable guktan race.</p> 

<p>When Gates of Discord came, we received two new lines of potions: awareness potions and concoctions.  Awareness potions offer focus effects for different types of spells.  Concoctions can be equipped and thrown as missiles, with varying effects like snare or damage.  We also received the quests to learn to process taelosian sludge and highland fudge, part of the larger set of processing quests available in all tradeskills.  Neither of the sludges have any known use at this time.</p>

<p>One of the latest and greatest items made with alchemy are the Omens of War augments.  These beauties require some rare and difficult drops, but create some fantastic items.  The complete process of creation also requires jewelcraft, and can be done by rogues with poisonmaking rather than shamans with alchemy.  Still, a fantastic option.</p>

<p>Most recently, Dragons of Norrath brought a hodgepodge of potions. Some are additions to the awareness lines of potions, including some with effects like regeneration, rather than focus effects.  There are also additions to the concoctions lines, and a way of bottling both DoN and previous concoctions to enhance their effects further.</p>

<p>Thus, the major lines of alchemy are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Old Alchemy (requires dropped ingredients, herbs only found in Shar Vahl)</li>
<li>Gypsy Alchemy (requires dropped ingredients, herbs only found on gypsies)</li>
<li>Revamp Alchemy (no dropped ingredients, herbs found in many places)</li>
<li>Luclin Alchemy (no dropped ingredients, herbs found only on Luclin)</li>
<li>Quintessence of Knowledge & Grandmaster's Medicine Bag</li>
<li>Ykesha Alchemy (some require drops and some don't, herb vendors vary by type of potion)</li>
<li>LDoN Alchemy (some revamp alchemy ingredients, some foraged ingredients)</li>
<li>GoD Alchemy (no dropped ingredients for concotions, only to process sludge, which has no known use)</li>
<li>Omens Augments (requires dropped ingredients, no herbs but other ingredients off varying vendors)</li>
<li>Dragons Alchemy (requires dropped ingredients, herbs found in various places)</li>

10 Alchemy - Tools Alchemy: Tools & Accessories <p><b><i>Bags:</i></b> Click the name of the vendor or crafted items to be taken to the purchasing information or recipe.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><!--item_ulinkedname:1141--></b> - <i>Vendor bought</i>, this fundamental alchemy tool is the container in which you combine your ingredients.  Every single alchemy recipe uses a medicine bag. They are available from most alchemy vendors, especially those carrying a large selection of herbs.</li>

<li><b><!--item_ulinkedname:8268--></b> - This is a <i>tailored</i> alternative to the Medicine Bag.  They are more expensive and more difficult to acquire but much easier to store between uses.  The item itself is not a container and can therefore be stored in any bags that can hold small items.  In order to get the usable container, you put the Folded Medicine Bag in one of your general inventory slots and right click it.  This will summon a Folding Medicine Bag, a No Drop container that is functionally identical to the vendor-sold Medicine Bag.  It is not No Rent.  Your Folded Medicine Bag remains in your possession after you have summoned the Folding Medicine Bag.  Therefore, when you are done with the summoned Folding Medicine Bag, you can delete it.  Just be careful to delete the summoned Folding bag rather than the Folded bag.</li>

<li><b><!--item_ulinkedname:1824--></b> - This <i>tailored</i> bag is the basic tool for creating potions that have 5 or 10 charges.  To use, combine either 5 or 10 single charges of the same potion into the bag.  This process will never fail but will never give you any further skill.  Because it never fails, anyone can use this bag, even those who are not practicing alchemists or even shamans.  The Bearskin Potion Bag is a container capable of holding tiny or small items.</li>

<li><b><!--item_ulinkedname:8270--></b> - A <i>tailored</i> alternative to the Bearskin Potion bag, this item works much like the Folded Medicine Bag.  They are a little more expensive and harder to make but much easier to store between uses.  The item itself is not a container and can therefore be stored in any bags that can hold small items.  In order to get the usable container, you put the Folded Bearskin Potion Bag in one of your general inventory slots and right click it.  This will summon a Folding Bearskin Potion Bag, a No Drop container that is functionally identical to the regular Bearskin Potion Bag.  It is not No Rent.  Your Folded Bearskin Potion Bag remains in your possession after you have summoned the Folding Bearskin Potion Bag.  Therefore, when you are done with the summoned Folding Bearskin Potion Bag, you can delete it.  Just be careful to delete the summoned Folding bag rather than the Folded bag.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p><b><i>Skill Modifiers:</i></b>  Click the name of the crafted items to be taken to the recipe.  Note that these items do NOT stack with one another.  When you equip more than one alchemy modifying item at a time, only the highest percentage item will affect your alchemy skill.  Also note that equipping any one of these items only affects your changes of success.  For the purposes of trivials, your actual skill is still what determines whether or not you can skill up off of that item and whether or not you receive a trivial message upon success.  For example, if your alchemy skill is 100 and you have this item equipped, you will have the same chance of success as someone with a skill of 105.  However, you will still be able to improve your skill by practicing with recipes that trivial from 101-105.  Whether or not you receive a trivial message will also be determined by the trivial of the potion compared to your actual skill, and ignores the effect of the skill modifying item.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><!--item_ulinkedname:8272--></b>:  This item is created by gnomes via <i>tinkering</i>. When equipped it grants a 5% bonus to your alchemy skill. </li>

<li><b>Alchemist Trophies:</b>  With the Prophecy of Ro expansion, the tradeskill trophies were revamped.  Now, aspiring trade skill masters can obtain quests from Baublie Diggs in the West Freeport newbie area to obtain an initial trophy that is commensurate with their current skill.  As combines to increase skill are continue, the trophy will evolve providing increasing bonuses to the tradeskiller's skill.  Additionally, these trophies will also summon no rent bags.

<ul><li><b><!--item_ulinkedname:23002--></b>:  Provides a 1% bonus to your alchemy skill and will summon a Beginner Artisan Satchel.</li>

<li><b><!--item_ulinkedname:23003--></b>:  Provides a 2% bonus to your alchemy skill and will summon an Apprentice Artisan Satchel.</li>

<li><b><!--item_ulinkedname:23004--></b>:  Provides a 4% bonus to your alchemy skill and will summon a Freshman Artisan Satchel. </li>

<li><b><!--item_ulinkedname:23005--></b>:  Provides a 5% bonus to your alchemy skill and will summon a Journeyman Artisan Satchel. </li>

<li><b><!--item_ulinkedname:23006--></b>: Provides an 8% bonus to your alchemy skill and will summon an Expert Artisan Satchel. </li>

<li><b><!--item_ulinkedname:23007--></b>: Provides a 12% bonus to your alchemy skill and will summon a Master Artisan Satchel. </li>

<li><b><!--item_ulinkedname:23008--></b>: Provides a 15% bonus to your alchemy skill and will summon an Artisan Satchel. </li></ul>

<li><b>Philosopher's Stone</b>:  <b>This item can no longer be obtained, except from other players.</b>  It adds 10% to your alchemy skill.  It used to come from the Alchemist Varona in Grieg's End, but she no longer spawns.</li>

<li><b>Umbracite Swarm Orb</b>:  This <i>dropped</i> item is from Vex Thal and adds a whopping 15% to your alchemy skill, as well as <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12413">a whole slew of other stats</a>. It is No Trade.</li>

85 Alchemy-Mastery Alchemy: A Guide to Mastery <p>Though there are many paths to mastering any skill and you are always free to choose whichever recipes make the most sense for you and the ingredients you can obtain or afford, many of the tradeskillers over the years have collaborated to provide a suggested path to mastery for those who seek guidance.</p>

558 EQTC:Learn:TailoringNEW NEW! Tailoring Skill Up Guide <p>Ok so the stuff I'm about to post below isn't technically *new*.  It's been around for a long time in one fashion or another over in the EQ Traders Forums.  I'm just transcribing it here so it might be easier for newer folks to find.</P>

<p>If you have zero skill in Tailoring, the first thing you should do is go to Crescent Reach and see Tailor Nabirye.  She's on the second floor of Crescent Reach with the other Tailoring Vendor and Quest NPCs.  From her, you can obtain a set of "freebie" Tailoring tasks that will raise your tailoring skill to 54.  Hint:  You don't get noticable experience or faction gain from doing these tasks, so just keep asking for supplies and make more items until you hit the trivial for the item she has asked you to make.  Then you can either turn 20 of the item in or delete the quest and get the next one.  There is also a "freebie" type quest offered in Abysmal Sea.  It's a little different and not quite as refined as the CR freebies are.</p>

<p>After you've gotten your skill to 54, immediately head over to West Freeport and see Baublie Diggs for the Beginner Tailor Test (<a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=q233&menustr=040110000000">Trophy Quests</a> for more info).  Gather the ingredients up, make the items, turn them in and get your trophy.  Though this won't modify your tailoring skill much at this point, always keep it equipped when you're doing combines so it evolves with your skill level.  Eventually it will give you a nice skill mod.  You can wait and get one of the other trophy tasks, but be warned:  The higher the "test" the more difficult it becomes to obtain the ingredients to make the items in the test.<p>

<p>From this point you have lots of different paths you can choose.  Personally, if your only goal is to skill up as quickly as possible, I recommend sticking with Silk and Leather glove templates.  The silks and pelts aren't super hard to come by either by farming, barter or vendor diving depending on your available platinum reserves.  There's an alternative route of Hilt Wraps, but those will only get you to 268 (technically you can go to 282, but the higher pelts have better uses) and can only be done with pelts.<p>

204 EQTC:Learn:Xref:loy_research Cross-Reference: LoY Spell Research Drops <p>This is a list of the pages, runes, words, and other components needed for researching 50+ spells, designed to help figure out what drops are worth keeping and roughly what they're worth.  In the parenthesis after each spell name is the first letter of the class, and the level at which that class can use it.  Thus, (M55) denotes a level 55 mage spell, while (S59) is a level 59 shaman spell.  Components that can be used to <a href="<!--server:x-->recipes/recipe_page.php?article=125&rsa=Spell%20Research&sub=other&sb=item&menustr=080105120000">tailor robes</a> have the name of the swatch they produce noted after the spells.</p>
<p>Where drops have a ? before and after the name, they were only listed in the recipes for priest class spells and not for the int caster spells.  I'm not sure yet if they are mistakes in game or if something got goofed when they were translated on the boards for us, so take those with a grain of salt.  Also, the 60 cleric spell Blessing of Aegolism was listed with the same component twice in the recipe, so in practice it probably requires at least one more thing that's not noted for it here. Lastly, quite frankly my eyes started to glaze over as I plowed through the sea of yaeths and words and runes and toharons and zeannors, so there are probably mistakes of my own doing.  If you find any, please just point em out on the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=79">message boards</a> and I'll get em fixed.</p>

205 EQTC:Learn:Xref:old_research Cross-Reference: Old Spell Research Drops <p>These are the pages, runes, words, and other components needed for researching level 1-49 spells, with a list of what can be made from each.  It is intended to as a guide for researchers who want a quick reference for what items they should save, and for both researchers and non-researchers who want to know the value of the research items they find.  This list includes some ingredients that are also available from vendors as well as items that are drops only.  See the <a href="<!--server:x-->sources/source_trade_page.php?st=Spell%20Research&menustr=110120000000">Spell Research Trade Supplies</a> list for information on what is available on vendors and where. </p>

<p>Pages can only be used by enchanters while runes can only be used by wizards.  Words, on the other hand, are used by both necromancers and magicians.  None of the same words are used by both classes, so they have been listed with their respective classes so that necros and mages have more tailored lists for their own uses.  The level at which a spell can be used by that class is noted in parenthesis after the spell name.  Components that can be used to <a href="<!--server:x-->recipes/recipe_page.php?article=125&rsa=Spell%20Research&sub=other&sb=item&menustr=080105120000">tailor robes</a> have the name of the swatch they produce noted after the spells.</p>

206 EQTC:PayPal Help EQ Traders Corner Stay Running and Ad-free!! <table width=\"90%\" border=\"0\">

<p>
There are many expenses that come with running this site, and as the popularity of EQTC grows, so do the costs. It is no longer feasible for us to pay for the costs by ourselves, so we\'re asking for the help of those in the community who are able to contribute. <i>(FYI: All of the first two years, including domain name registrations, EZBoard fees, software and hardware costs were covered by the DenMother and House Ogre. Since December 2001, we\'ve accepted donations, but they do not cover the growing costs of running this site.)</i> While we\'re thrilled that the site has become so popular, the surge in traffic is really starting to cost money, especially now that it\'s become so costly to keep the message boards free of ads. (Not to mention a solid 60-80 hours a week of combined time from the DenMother and the House Ogre while the database is being built/developed.)
</p> 
<p>
We really <i><b>DO</b></i> want to keep the boards ad-free, and continue to develop the tradeskill database that will make recipe and supply hunting much easier, but we cannot do it without the support of the community.
</p> 
<p>
Currently, we have only the one method for donating to the site, though we may work out a second alternative for those of you who have problems with Paypal accounts for any reason:
</p> 
<p>
<b>Paypal</b> - donations go directly to the DemMother to help cover the new hosting costs, message board costs, software/hardware expenses, etc. If there\'s any left over (there usually isn\'t), it will go to cover things for Niami like asprin, chocolate, massage therapy, ... and hair color to hide the grey hairs that the site has caused ... consider it her \"pay\" for the amount of work put into this site. ;)

5 EQTC Editor Krazick The Patch Message I won't repeat the entire patch message, but here are the parts that are relevant to tradeskills, along with some commentary:

<ul><li><b>Added over 1,000 new tradeskill recipes for all levels of skill,</b> along with many recipe books. A few of the vendors of Norrath might be able to get you started on your way <i>(of course, we'll be scrambling here to get the information online for all of you, but expect things to be a tad ... hectic ... for a while) </i></li>
<li>Added Mortar and Pestle to a Thurgadin merchant <i>(this should make poisonmaking, dyemaking, pottery idols, and a few other things a bit easier for those who have chosen to live mostly in Velious)</i></li>
<li>Rubbing Alcohol is now available from a vendor in Thurgadin <i>(happy shawl questing! No more running to Cabilis!)</i></li>
<li>Hit point bonuses on food items should be working <i>(centi steaks and centi toe stew, anyone?) </i></li>
<li>Characters can no longer scribe a scroll that they can't cast due to deity restrictions <i>(imbue gem spells were bugged for a while so anyone of the proper level/class could scribe them, now you should be able to only scribe the spell for your deity)</i></li></ul>
<p>Your best bet for the first 24 hours is to keep an eye on the message boards for the new recipes. It's going to take some time to get these things webbed, especially with the server lag I'm already seeing this morning from eager folks at w*rk hitting the site, trying to see if anything's been found yet. 
<p><b><i>Addendum - </i></b>
<p>Erm, um ... if you tried to access the message boards earlier, and were timing out all over the place, you weren't alone. I feel sort of bad for the folks at EZBoard when they saw the load hit today. We've now been moved to a server of our very own (I'll be sending them a very heartfelt thank you to them for their fast work). The reroute to the new message board server is automagic, but please DO change your bookmarks when you have a chance, to cut down on their load.. It will take me days before I can change all the links on all the pages other than the front page, as the recipes that everyone's trying to get information on are the priority right now. <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/index.php">New message board link</a>
<p>It's going to take a while to get recipes into their proper places, and stuff tested out. There's a temporary recipe page found here, and as things there get verified, tested, etc., I'll get them onto the normal recipe pages as well.

6 EQTC Editor Krazick Happy Mother's Day! In a very hobbit sort of way (giving gifts on a special day instead of receiving them) this tired mother (of this community, plus 3 cats ;D) has a plethora of gifts for you all. Recipes, recipes everywhere! Yes, it's chaos everywhere, with tradesfolk running around, comparing notes, wanting to exchange their gifts for other gifts, and so on. It's going to take quite a while for things to settle down around here and for "DenMom" to clean up everything. In the meantime, you'll want to watch the message boards (as always), as well as bookmark the following: Main collection of May 8, 2002 recipes, <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=g79&menustr=080040120000">wood elven cultural</a>, <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=g67&menustr=080040000000">other cultural</a>. Yes, I really do mean to move each of the cultures to their own page for easier sorting out, and then later merge them with their other cultural recipes, but I keep getting sidetracked by new recipe updates. It'll get there.
<p>I've been agonizing for over a day now what to mention in a front page update, as so much of it is newsworthy to varying parts of the tradeskill community, and I know, no matter what I highlight, someone will feel left out. Some posts late last night/early this morning decided me on what would be highlighted ...
<p>Druids and tradeskillers from all across Norrath have been hard at work, deciphering the Liber Brassica Felix books, in search of the Protection of the Cabbage spell (a single-target PoTG). It's been a monumental undertaking, and I'd like to thank the EQTC community and the folks over at the Druid Grove for sharing information and ideas enough to get this sorted out quickly. The quest has been gargantuan, to say the least. And it's now over. The lovely Lady Xanthe Ravenwolf of Bertoxx exhaustedly reported in last night that she had completed the quest, and was kind enough to provide us with information on the reward (the spell and a nice earring), and a run-down of the quest. (I'll be working on webbing it after the caffeine kicks in.) We then received a visit from Rich Waters, one of the Lead Designers from EQ (I swear, he's got to be getting as little sleep as I am right now, from the looks of his posts on the boards!)
<p>Rich said
<p><blockquote>
Congratulations, Xanthe!
<p>With the first completion of this quest, a new spell was brought into the world, and I'd like to thank the many druids and tradesfolk who participated in this event. 
<p>This quest is unusual in EverQuest, as it was intended to be done once and then change after it was solved. In the next patch, Xanthe will reap the rewards of finishing the quest first, and all druids will find the scroll much easier to attain now that the quest has been completed.
<p>The quest will stay in game, for people who enjoy tradeskills and anyone who completes the full quest will find the final reward is quite suitable for the effort.
<p>Thanks for playing,
<p>Rich Waters
<br>Lead Designer, EverQuest
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, folks, if you wait until the next patch, the spell will be easier to obtain. The quest will stay in game for those of us who enjoy playing with such stuff <i>{curls protectively around her fishing pole and her Misty Thicket Picnic}</i>, but for those who don't have a tradeskill junkie's patience with such quests, find enough patience to wait for the next patch. ;D
<p>I'm back to practicing my dual-wielding skills - foraging for tufts of dire wolf fur on one machine while tackling site updates on the other ... have fun with all the new recipes, everyone!

7 EQTC Editor Krazick Just a quick note to let folks know that I've changed links around since the last front page update. The main May 8, 2002 recipes page can still be found in the same spot, but ALL cultural recipes have been moved to their <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=g67&menustr=080040000000">permanent links off the cultural recipes page</a>. In another week or so, I hope to split out the May 8, 2002 recipes onto thier permanent recipes pages. I'll also be redoing FAQs and trade supplies listings as time permits. 2002-05-18 06:57:44 2003-06-12 02:38:13 2003-06-12 02:37:31 0 EQTC Editor Krazick
8 EQTC Editor Krazick Patch Day! It's another BIG day with regards to tradeskills, and it will be a while before updates hit the site and the dust settles. I'll make another update later today, once we have some solid information in place, but a few things to note in the meantime. 
<p><li>The initial writeup for the <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=q34&menustr=120010000000">Protection of the Cabbage quest</a> is up on the site, including the new earring reward. Nondruids who had been working on this quest should pay special note to the fact that the previous all/all earring is now druid-only. </li>
<li>Many new smithing recipes were put in today, as well as many new trivials. It WILL be mid-afternoon before even the first of these gets onto the site. It's even more important than ever that you READ before you post your questions and comments in the message boards, as we're going to be running a tight herd on the chaos caused by stampeding smiths. There are specific sticky topics set aside JUST for recipes and stats, and other threads set aside for questions. </li>
<li>Other quests, item stats, etc. have changed, and we'll get those updates on the site as able. </li>
<li>Rennet vendors are back in place. </li>
<li>Remember to watch your manners when posting on the message boards. A LOT of folks have been less-than-mannered lately, and have found themselves in the doghouse. The posting and conduct rules are there for a reason, and we are very actively enforcing them. This goes especially for those of you wanting to let off some steam. Even in the Primal Scream Forum, remember that the rules apply. Keep it family-rated, and remember NO personal attacks. We understand that when tradeskills change, folks tend to get a tad ... excited ... but this message board community really does NOT appreciate some of the foaming at the mouth we've seen lately. Such antics only distract us from making sure that data gets accurately reported, then recorded, onto the site. </li></ul>
<p><b>June 5, Addendum 1: </b>
<p>The following is a post from Rich Waters, one of the Lead Designers for EQ: 
<p><blockquote>If you are not a Druid and you've completed the PoTC quest, go and speak with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove - She's more than happy to give you something you'll be able to use instead of Xanthe's Earring.
<p>If you're one of the few people who did the quest twice and lost an earring due to it being made lore, petition in game and a GM will reimburse you with the nine ingredients needed to make another earring after verifying your loss.
<p>If your Xanthe's Earring is out of charges, trade it in with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove, and she'll give you one that has charges. When items that didn't have an effect are retroactively changed, it sometimes causes the "out of charges" bug. 
<p>To trade the earring in with Rebecca, give her your Xanthe's Earring and she'll give you an alternate kind of earring. Give her back the alternate earring, and she'll give you a fully charged Xanthe's earring back.
<p>Sorry for any inconvenience this has caused you, this should solve any difficulties anyone's had with the earring.
<p>Thanks,
<p>- Rich

9 Niami Denmother I have several things to highlight today:
<p><blockquote>The new smithing recipes and trivials are slowly trickling in, and I have some requests to make, based on the first day\'s worth of data. Please be sure that when you\'re reporting on stats for new items, that you\'re including race/class/weight information. I know it takes a few extra moments to scribble it all down, but it really makes a difference on the completeness of information for the site. Please make sure you\'re clearly stating trivials - there\'s a difference between \"trivial 222\" and \"trivial <=222\". Make sure you\'re being fully clear if you know the <i>exact</i> trivial vs. it being trivial at that point or some point below. Please be sure that when you\'re reporting new trivials on old cultural items that you are explicitly stating whether you\'re working in racial chain or plate for things like dark elven and high elven armors. It may seem like a little thing, but when we\'re already dealing with normal, enchanted, and imbued/enchanted armor, I refuse to \"assume\" that I know which set you\'re talking about.
<p>That having been said, there is a lot of data already on the appropriate smithing pages. If you find a smithing page that does <i>not</i> include two trivial colums (old & new), then I have not yet processed any new information for that specific group of items. This may mean that nobody has submitted any new information, or it may just mean that I\'ve not reached that part of the huge pile of updates that have been dropped in my lap.
<p>Yes, I\'m aware that pretty much every smithing guide in the Learn Smithing section is now totally outdated. This situation isn\'t likely to change until new trivials are more fully nailed down and folks start submitting new guides based on that information.
<p>I\'ve managed to verifiy race changes to halfling cultural tailored armor, but folks are slow in reporting in whether other of the new cultural items that were added on May 5 have had stats changed based on yesterday\'s patch. Wood elves, especially, please check all those lovely tailored armors of yours, and report in if anything has changed with your armor. (I\'m hoping half elf was added to the sets.)
<p>Contrary to yesterday\'s patch message, enchanted clay is still not stacking. Whoops! 
<p>More updates have been done to the <a href=\"http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/potc_intro.htm\">PoTC quest writeup</a>, including the addition of the non-tradeskill spell-only version of the quest. It still needs a lot of fleshing out, but that\'s going to take more time than I currently have.
<p>The mailbox to which all my private EZBoard messages are sent is beyond overflowing with viruses, trojan horses, spam, unwanted trash as well as various stray emails from folks who need my attention. I\'m afraid to say that I\'m beyond behind responding to any real mail that might be lurking in that mailbox, and it\'s not likely to change any time in the near future. In some cases, I cannot respond as the people in question have not included any email address in their message (EZBoards doesn\'t include your email addy on private messages). Additionally, I\'m having problems with my ISP that I use for <i>the rest</i> of my email, and it\'s been timing out left, right, sideways and diagonally for the last several days. For the dozen or so of you offering to take over the fashion section, however, I\'m going to close down that section of the site. Due to a horde of problems, as well as system load, it\'s not feasible for this site to track every single new/old set of player-made armor and track two versions of the graphics for them (with and without Luclin models).
<p>Folks have started emailing moderators when they have problems registering an EZBoard account. Unfortunately, we don\'t own EZBoards, so it\'s rather hard for us to troubleshoot these. You\'ll want to report such problems in directly to the EZBoard <a href=\"http://pub121.ezboard.com/fezboardaccountproblemsfrm1\">Login/Support</a> Forum and see if they can help. (You don\'t need to be registered/logged in to post to that forum.)
<p>I\'ve developed zero tolerance for certain antics on the message boards. Please remember that the Primal Scream Forum, as is mentioned on the banner text when you enter that forum does not allow personal attacks (name-calling, slander, etc.), and yes, saying \"I hope you @#$ \'ing die\" is WELL beyond acceptable behavior and is subject to immediate banning. We also ask, rather clearly, that you \"keep it clean\". Unmasked swearing in subject lines, as well as swearing (however masked) <i>at specific people</i> are also not acceptable. For those that are unaware of the history of that forum, it was originally meant as a spot where people could rant and rave out their tradeskill frustrations after a horrible run of luck, etc., while still keeping it within the realms of polite public behavior. While we\'ve allowed some leeway on what\'s allowed in there, it is still not a place to come in and spew filth. There are plenty of other message boards in the world where you can spew that trash if you really need to, but we don\'t need it in our community.</blockquote> 2002-06-06 07:25:45 2002-11-03 07:25:45 2003-02-12 01:54:20 1 EQTC Editor Tobin Itharel
10 Niami Denmother Just a few quick updates:
<p>Cazic-Thule jewelcraft has been deciphered, and the first pieces have been successfully made. Recipes and stats are on the <a href=\"http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_cazicthule.htm\">Cazic-Thule recipes page</a>.
<p>The dust is finally starting to slowly settle from the June 5 patch and all the changes to smithing trivials. It\'s still going to take a while to get it all updated, but we\'re getting there. For all of those asking on the various forums, as far as we know <i>only</i> smithing trivials were changed.
<p>There\'s another patch this Wednesday. Hopefully the rockhoppers and sambata that share a cave in Dawnshroud Peaks will find their way home again, as well as a few other spawn issues. :) We\'ll have more of an update Wednesday.
<p>We received the following suggestion on our Quests message board, and there\'s already been responses that it does help when having problems with quest NPCs:
<p><blockquote>If any NPC is not responding to direct text do this. Clear your target window and say the quest text. For some reason they will respond when you do NOT have them targeted. So just make sure you don\'t have a target at all by pressing the escape key.</blockquote>
<p>As an addendum to this, close your inventory window before you hail them, as this has been reported to be one issue with non-responsive NPCs. If that doesn\'t work, close your eyes, stand on one foot, bay at the moon and hit the ENTER key ... wait, sorry, that last bit is the Bristlebane in me. Try the non-targeted talk and the inventory closed if you\'re having problems with an NPC, and, as always, remember to research in advance to verify that you have the proper faction, proper text, etc. 
<p><b>Administrivia:</b> we\'re working on collecting all the information needed to have a comprehensive tradeskill database that will allow cross-referencing of trade supplies, sources (vendors, mob drops, etc.) and recipes. It\'s a huge undertaking, and it\'s going to take a lot of time to get it ready for public viewing. If you see requests in one of the forums asking for help collecting data, that\'s why, and the information we need the most is on the exotic stuff - tradeskill drops off mobs, player-made cultural items that are then used as ingredients for other recipes (i.e., adamantite chain jointing, and other such things) and so on. So, as you\'re tradeskilling and shopping, the data that you get from a right-click is likely exactly what we\'re looking for. Keep an eye on the various forums for a request for your tradeskill(s). Meanwhile, this half-blind hobbit is toddling off tomorrow for lasik eye surgery,and is supposed to be MIA from the boards and other eye-strain until sometime Wednesday (patch day). Wish me luck! 2002-06-10 07:30:21 2002-11-03 07:30:21 0
16 EQTC Editor Tobin Itharel Patch Day ... seen with \\ <p>I\'m back from my lasik surgery at last, though the trip home took 6 hours
instead of 2 due to an accident closing off the highway we came home on. I\'m
exhausted, and going to avoid taxing my energy levels, much less my
\"new\" eyes, so site updates WILL wait until tomorrow. Please, please,
PLEASE in the meantime, remember to READ before you post your questions and
comments in the various forums, especially since it sounds like everyone\'s been
posting helter-skelter over there. The more mayhem folks make in the \"data
only\" threads, the longer it\'s going to take me to get things updated
tomorrow. For those who haven\'t caught it yet, here\'s what was tradeskill-related
from the patch message:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>** Trade Skills **</p>
  <p>- Improved many of the smithed Acrylia items<br>
  - Large Blocks, Blocks, and Small Blocks of Magic Clay are now stackable<br>
  - Brick of Deathsteel Ore is now stackable<br>
  - Several blacksmithed cultural armor set pieces have received a slight
  improvement to their armor class.<br>
  - Tarnished and Fine Steel Weapons may now be recycled into ore by placing
  them into a forge with<br>
  a water flask.<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other items of note:
<blockquote>
  <p>- Acrylia Reinforced Armor is now usable by short races<br>
  - Shadowhaven Faction Amulet should be more useful now<br>
  - Loremaster Borannin should be responding properly again<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It\'s very likely that you folks now know more about the effects from this
patch than I do, and it will stay that way until tomorrow. Please remember to
post trivial and stat updates to the proper spots in the message boards (there
are threads already started in the Smithing forum) ... and watch those vents
that are starting to pop up with inappropriate language and/or in inappropriate
spots, please.</p> 2002-06-12 12:00:00 2003-04-08 02:02:49 1 Niami Denmother
17 EQTC Editor Tobin Itharel Mischief and Mayhem <p>Fortunately, things are relatively quiet on the tradeskill front right now.
Discussion of the new EQ interface that is currently on Test can be found via <a href=\"http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm64.showMessage?topicID=275.topic\" target=\"_new\">this
message board thread</a>. Some progress has been made at last on sorting out the
<a href=\"http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_cazicthule.htm\">Cazic Thule
recipes</a>. As always, a lot of updates are going on behind the scenes on a
daily basis, especially in narrowing down smithing trivials, adding stats for
the newer tradeskill items, etc. A few weeks back, I also had to split apart the
cultural armor stats from the main armor stats page. This has caused quite a bit
of confusion, and it\'s currently not the most elegant or intuitive layout, but
it will have to do for the near future. For now, all smithed cultural armor
stats can be found a) via the nav buttons on the left-hand side of the <a href=\"http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm\">main
armor stats page</a> and, b) via a link at the TOP of each cultural recipes page
for that culture\'s stats. I apologize for the kludgy feel of this, but it\'s
going to be a while before I can tackle nav issues.
<p>This brings me to the mischief and mayhem portion of this update. I\'ve been
dual-wielding computers for quite a while now, as it allows me to work on site
updates at the same time I am performing research in-game, wield both my
accounts at once to have easier access to tradeskill mules, etc. Unfortunately,
the setup I\'ve been using for the last couple of years is not ergonomic, and
hasn\'t been very good for my chronic back problems. We finally made arrangements
to have both my office and Ngreth\'s office redone, with setups that should make
them much more comfortable workplaces. We\'ve been planning this for a couple
months, and yesterday the movers arrived to box up everything in my office, so
the folks could come in today with the custom setup for my office. Ngreth\'s
office was to follow next Tuesday. Unfortunately, some wires were crossed
somewhere (I blame Bristlebane, may all his toe fur fall off!), and the
installers showed up today with <i>Ngreth\'s</i> office setup, not mine. They\'re
not even done building mine. Soooo ... Ngreth and two installers are busy
disassembling Ngreth\'s old office right now and packing it up, most of my office
possessions are taking over the guest room, my cats are frantic and hiding from
the chaos, and I ... am working off a card table set up in my almost-empty
office. I\'ll be working off this setup until Tuesday morning, at which time I
re-disassemble everything and pray there are no more surprises in store. (edit:
hubby\'s office is taking 2 days to complete, so I expect mine will as well ...
wheeeeee).
<p>{gibber}
<p>Needless to say, I\'ll likely get less accomplished than normal for the next
few days. 2002-06-26 12:00:00 0
18 EQTC Editor Tobin Itharel Unburying! <p>Well, it\'s a week later than I\'d originally planned, but my new home office
furniture is finally installed, and I\'ve got the 2 PCs and the laptop set back
up. It\'s going to take me quite a while to get the CDs, documentation, maps,
knicknacks, unpacked, sorted and put into their new spots, but I\'m already
enjoying the feeling of \"space\" that the new layout gives me. (The
extra storage space will also come in handy, as I\'m definitely a packrat!)
<p>Meanwhile, I\'m sure you folks are more interested in what\'s going on
tradeskill-wise, so here\'s a small update for you. Barren Flounder, that had
been chased into virtual extinction by the introduction of Timorous Tuna into
their spawning grounds back in November, have been seen once again in Erud\'s
Crossing on Test server. This is wonderful news for the \"good\" erudite
clerics, who have been unable to enjoy the use of faithstones that their other
healing brethren have been using. Hopefully it will be re-introduced onto the
live servers with the next patch. We\'re also hoping to see a few other item
tweaks next patch, such as to the stats of the Cazic Thule armor and weapons,
stackability of Tae Ew meat, etc.
<p>As time and oomph permit, I\'m going through all <a href=\"secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm\">the
armor stats pages</a> to see what\'s missing for the older smithed armor sets. As
I\'m finding missing data, the relevant stats page is having question marks added
in the appropriate spots, and on the more major information, I\'m <a href=\"http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=6540.topic\">whimpering
for help</a> on data that I can\'t find elsewhere. After I tackle all the armors
(I\'m about a third of the way through the cultural sets now), I\'ll tackle the
smithed weapons. Those of you with a solid player-made weapon collection are
more than welcome to compare what\'s on the weapon stats page with the
information on your weapons, and post with missing information in that same
message board thread.
<p>My thanks to Fallenhero for the new art at the top of this page. We try very
hard to keep the site fast-loading, without a lot of extra frufru, but it\'s
amazing how a couple tiny files make a difference. :)
<p>For the Americans amongst us, may you have a happy and <i>safe</i>
Independence Day tomorrow.</p> 2002-07-03 12:00:00 0
19 EQTC Editor Tobin Itharel Just a few quick things... <p>The fish & game wardens in Erud\'s Crossing are happy to announce that
their efforts to reintroduce barren flounder into the waters have been
successful. (i.e., Erud\'s Crossing was patched today) Erudite clerics of the
non-evil persuasion can now join their priestly bretheren in the possession of a
coveted <a href=\"secrets/recipes_may8.htm#pottery\">Faithstone</a>. <font color=\"#800000\"><b><i>(Note:
folks on the Quellious server apparently did not get the zone patch and are
still fishing up Timorous Tuna. The other servers, so far, seem to have been
restocked properly.)</i></b></font>
<p>The mysteries of <a href=\"secrets/recipes_cazicthule.htm\">Cazic Thule
tailoring</a> continue to unravel ... so to speak.
<p>Those of you who have seen stats of items on other sites and have come here
looking for the recipes may find that the following will aid in your search:
<ul>
  <li>Those looking for \"Luminate\" armor (as per Alla\'khazam\'s and <a href=\"http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/\" target=\"_new\">EQ\'Lizer</a>)
    really want to look for \"Luminant\" heraldic armor, which is <a href=\"secrets/recipes_smithing_human_qeynos.htm\">Human
    Cultural, Qeynos</a>.
  <li>Those of you looking for Stormreaper Chainwoven or Stormreaper Steelwoven
    will not that it is not smithed (as per <a href=\"http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/\" target=\"_new\">EQ\'Lizer</a>).
    These items are made via <a href=\"secrets/recipes_tailoring_halfling.htm\">halfling
    cultural <i>tailoring</i></a><i>. (It seems their data entry gnomes are a
    tad busy right now, but these will get fixed in their database soon).</i>
  <li>Those of you looking for Tae Ew items, the tailored Tae Ew goodies are
    still on the <a href=\"secrets/recipes_cazicthule.htm\">Cazic Thule recipes</a>
    page.
  <li>If you\'re looking for ___ Heraldic armor, or \"that new Veeshan bard
    armor\", you\'ll find it, again, under <a href=\"secrets/recipes_smithing_human_qeynos.htm\">human
    cultural, Qeynos</a></li>

100 Niami Denmother EQ2 Beta! Applications to become a beta tester for the long-awaited EQ2 will start being accepted next Monday, May 3, starting at 10am PDT.  Further details can be found on the <a href="http://everquest2.station.sony.com/beta.jsp" target="_new">EQ2 beta application page</a>. Given the amount of excitement I've seen from folks regarding this, please expect a good chunk of lag from that site while all the ravening hordes pounce upon it. :) 2004-04-27 01:09:07 2004-04-27 01:11:26 2004-04-27 01:11:11 0 Niami Denmother
101 Niami Denmother Random Housecleaning I did a bit of work on the links page while waiting for my EQ2 beta application to process this morning. While there\'s no way to include links to all the EQ sites out there, I\'ve hopefully managed a decent cross-section of links for you, as well as removed some links that were dead, defunct, or mortally wounded. You\'ll also find that I expanded the offerings in the other games section to include some of the other MMORPGs that are out there. 2004-05-03 01:46:16 0
102 Niami Denmother WTF! No, I've not taken to swearing at folks, I'm just bouncing around after appearing in a comic strip.<p>
Niami's rolling pin first appeared in art when <a href="http://www.gucomics.com" target="_new">Woody</a> made up a lovely sig pic for the boards for me. Now it's back ... along with the rest of her, and Ngreth, too!  If you've not been following <a href="http://www.wtfcomics.com" target="_new">WTF Comics</a>, I recommend that you do.  Peek at issue <a href="http://69.57.151.222/archive.html?141?#141" target="_new">#141</a> (the rolling pin!) and then <a href="http://69.57.151.222/archive.html?145?#145" target="_new">#145</a> and <a href="http://69.57.151.222/archive.html?146?#146" target="_new">#146</a>(and onwards if more have come out by the time that you read this).

103 Ngreth Thergn Ngreth's Guild Summit Summary <p>After finally receiving our invite, Niami decided to send the House Ogre instead
  of herself to the Guild Summit. With that you were already doomed to poor writing!
  But I will press on and do the best I can. I also did not bring a camera, so
  we will have to muddle on without pictures.</p>
<p>Being local, and having to work on Friday, I declined to show up at the Baseball
  Game, and instead came in for breakfast Saturday morning. Once there I shook
  a few hands, and then sat down to chat with a few guild leaders/representatives,
  two of them being leaders on the server I actually play on.</p>
<p>After Breakfast, The group was bussed to SOE (where since I drove, I missed
  the big group picture.. oh well) where we sat in the nice hot San Diego weather
  while John Smedley gave us an introduction to what we should expect for the
  day. One big revelation was this: Gates of Discord was intended to work with a
  level cap increase to be released on the 5th anniversary of Everquest. Because
  of this the zones were tuned for level 68 or 70, making it the WAY too difficult
  beast that we faced. Additionally, a developer that is no longer with SOE (no
  more than that was said about the developer, as I am sure they are legally
  required to not say anything more) decided to play with waaaaay high attack
  skill numbers on the mobs. Put these two together, and you got the near-impossible
  expansion that we got.</p>
<p>Now that said, they have tuned Gates of Discord down, and reduced the overly
  high attack skills of the mobs, so that it is much more possible than before,
  though the later zones are still raid oriented. So if you had a bad experience
  before, you should go try it out again. (The main part of the retuning went
  in two patches ago, though they are still doing some final tweaking.)</p>
<p>Another interesting piece of information that was given out was that the largest
  segment of EverQuest fans are level 30 to 50. They do NOT base this on just
  the number of characters at the level, but at the amount of playtime in those
  levels.</p>
<p>There was also talk about how BETA can be improved, and they are open to suggestions.
  They are planning on trying to invite more "uber guild" in total
  to help them with testing. These guilds would be Character Copied over in full.
  (At a dinner later in the evening, I found out that a guild was invited in
  whole, and copied, to help beta test Gates of Discord, but they decided they
  would rather raid on live server than help Beta test... so were not useful
  during the testing. This is a problem in general where testers go raid with
  their
  guild on live instead of testing as they have been invited... instead they
  just hang long enough to get "strats" for live release.) They may
  even bring back the "token" system that was used in PoP beta to help
  convince people to test.</p>
<p>During this chat they said that though marketing folks will be around to listen,
  they are NOT there to sell us anything. And I can say they did not make any
  attempt to push anything on us while we were there :) That is not to say there
  was not any marketing at all, it was voluntary. (I will explain this more soon.)</p>
<p>The biggest thing I want to bring from the initial conversation is this. The
  Developers themselves love the game, they want to make a fun game, and a game
  that you want to play. They play the game themselves, and want it to be fun.
  The developers pay includes royalties from the games, so they want it to sell.
  Though not directly in the conversation, it seems that for whatever reason
  the decision makers were not listening to the developers. This summit is to keep that from
  happening again. The developers will listen to us, and the decision makers
  will listen to the developers</p>
<p>Next we were taken on a tour of the three buildings that make up the SOE compound.
  We got to see a few of the servers that make up the game. Many of the servers
  were in an off site building, but a few were there. Each server is 30 dual
  pentium 4's with 2 gigs of ram. There are 48 servers, making for 1440 computers
  for just the server hardware. This does not include dev clusters, login servers,
  chat servers, databases ... so you can imagine the huge undertaking it is. There
  was some indirect information indicating they run Raid 5's, but raid 5's do
  not preclude disasters, just make them rarer and more recoverable :) If two
  drives fail at the same time (rare, but not statistically impossible) data
  loss can occur. FULL backups are made daily, so the worst case is a full days
  rewind.</p>
<p>At the end of the tour, they pointed out a room where they will be showing
  Omens of War and Epic 2.0 graphics. They said that during lunch we can go in
  and see if we wish. That was the extent of the marketing push. Of course many
  people wanted to see epic 2.0, so the room was crowded :)</p>
<p>After the tour, we settled down into 5 smaller groups to speak with the developers
  about our concerns. The following is what we spoke about, basically in the
  order in which I wrote it down. <strong>NONE of this is a promise that this
  will be done, this is just a listing of the discussions we had.</strong> I
  will mention when the developers gave ideas of what they would like to do,
  but of course all has to go through approvals and time before they will become
  reality.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There was a request for Group and Guild /corpse commands
    <ul>
      <li>The current system creates a "list" of people that have permission
        to drag your corpse. A few ideas go with this. They are thinking of adding
        group, guild, and raid as valid elements to the list. Another possibility
        will to add options that you can turn on with slash commands and in the
        options window. These options will allow you to turn on group, guild,
        and raid dragging as a switch, meaning that all elements in the group,
        raid, or guild will be able to drag your corpse until you turn off the
        switch. One other thought on this, to make the draggers life easier, would
        be to allow a "drag" command which locks the corpse to the person, no
        longer requiring them to spam the /corpse command to drag. This would
        also allow the dragger to drag a group of corpses easily</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A request for RAID MOTD options in order to list items such as Main Assist,
    designated buffers, and such information.
    <ul>
      <li>Dev response: Basically looking into it, and liking the idea</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There was a request for sounds to be sendable or activatable.
    <ul>
      <li>This one went a different direction and greatly expanded. The developers
        indicated that they were interested in adding a "filter" that you can
        customize to make sounds if you see certain words or phrases. This went
        on with
        ever expanding ideas from adding options to add sounds on tells, group, and raid
        chat to fully customizable context-sensitive filtered chat windows.
        The results of this conversation were not clear.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There was an Official statement about the rumor that certain amounts of
    AA's will be needed in order to gain levels when the level cap is increased.
    <ul>
      <li><strong><font color="#339999">The developers officially confirmed that
            this is a FALSE rumor. The new level caps will NOT be dependent on
            the
            player having certain amounts of AA points. Players can still advance
            without getting any AA points.</font></strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In response to requests for a method to recover augments, and not have
    them destroyed...
    <ul>
      <li>The Developers indicated that it is in the works, they are still working
        on the balance and cost factor of it, but it is definitely planned. It
        may even be a trade skill item that allows it to be done. Nothing is
        set in stone.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There was a request for a guild bank.
    <ul>
      <li>They are looking into it, and it has a chance to go, but realistically
        the whole Guild code needs to be reworked. More on this later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>During this time I brought up that we want the appropriate developers to
    be given the time they need to fix the "old" trade skill issues, the main
    ones being Cultural Holes, and PoP drop rate.
    <ul>
      <li>Seeing neither Maddoc nor Absor were in the dev group I was working
        with, the developers I was with dutifully wrote it down :)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After this conversation we all had a cookout lunch. During this time I did
  speak with Maddoc, and put through that we want him to have time to fix the
  cultural and PoP issues :) So the info go the the correct person. I also decided to
  go hit the game room where they were showing off OoW graphics. The graphics
  for many of the new epic 2.0's were there, and even though the particle effects
  were not in, nor was the animation in yet, they were gorgeous (though I was
  not pleased with the looks of the Mage epic...)</p>
<p>After lunch, we had a meeting with a representative of the Customer Service
  team. The main thing they wanted to say is that they are introducing a new
  service for guilds. The introduced a guild dispute hotline. For certain issues,
  (only) a guild leader will be able to send mail to a mailbox and get priority
  assistance. This is a pilot program, and they will listen to feedback to make
  it better. Click on the image link to see the handout we were given.<br />
  <a href="../images/articles/GuildCSSmaller.jpg"><!--image_op:GuildCSThumb.jpg..77..100..0--></a><br />
  The most common thread of what people wanted was a way for up to 2 people other
  than the guild leader to also have permission to send mail, so that the guild
  leader is not forced with another task, or to ALWAYS be on. My handwriting
  on the page is for what additional information you can include to help make
  the letter sent more useful.</p>
<p>Each server has a dedicate GM from 2-11pm. The rest of the time, there is
  a pool of GM's that roam servers (this same pool is around during the dedicated
  time to help with large loads)</p>
<p>Be liberal with your use of /report. /report records the line of text right
  above the chat input line, and the 19 lines above this. This means you can
  scroll back to get the text you want. It will record those 19 lines even if
  they are not visible. One thing they were not clear about (because they were
  not sure) is it MAY record those 20 lines in ALL open chat windows. If you
  want proof of people being in an area. Do /who and then /report the /who results.
  This will be taken as proof while screen shots will not be taken as proof.
  SO sometimes you do have to anticipate problems :/</p>
<p>One thing they said was, if all else fails, and it is the last few seconds,
  loot the item. It is **NOT** likely that the item will be moved to the correct
  person. It will be very situational. But if the item is allowed to rot on a
  corpse, it absolutely will not be reimbursed. There is no log of items on
  mob corpses, there is a log of items looted. The customer service personnel
  have no way to tell what was on a corpse, so will not reimburse from it. *IF*
  you can show some proof that the person was around for the encounter (/report!)
  and that they were not able to loot for a game reason (Link dead is not a
  game reason), they *MAY* "move" the item (more like delete from one inventory
  and add to the other). So the basics is this, as a last resort, and a last
  resort only, do not let an item rot on a mob corpse, loot the item and hope
  that the planets are aligned correctly and you can get the item moved. Do not
  expect this to allow you to loot items for a person not around. They really
  need proof that the person was there for that particular encounter, and that
  SOE game issues prevented the person from looting (again, Link Death is NOT
  an SOE issue in normal situations... normally it is an ISP issue, and does
  not count)</p>
<p>The Guide program will be changed from them actively answering petitions,
  to them being an "event' troupe. They will go around running events on the
  server, making it more alive and dynamic.</p>
<p>After this conversation, developers were brought in again to have more conversations,
  this one more focused on what we want to see in the future, than what we want
  fixed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guild Tribute will cost 2/3 of the individual tribute, PER PERSON... so
    if an ability costs 60 tribute per 10 minutes for the individual, it will
    cost 40 tribute per 10 minutes per person ONLINE in the guild at the time.
    Some will stack, some will take "best" depending on the buff given.</li>
  <li>This brought up a whole conversation about guilds, and wanting more customizable
    guild rankings. The developers we spoke to seemed open to it, but indicated
    that it will probably take a whole guild system rewrite, and that they WANT
    to
    do this. It will just take prioritizing.</li>
  <li>There was a request to do something about stuns and mezs and similar things
    being all or nothing. The request was for a way to have these be partial,
    like have the attack ability be reduced in response to a partial. The developers
    did not seem very receptive to this, but they did not say no either.</li>
  <li>There was a request to have it possible to have AA's refunded, or just
    removed. The developers were very noncommittal to this.</li>
  <li>One side dev comment was that they will work really hard to make sure that
    future raid sizes are set to max 54 and not have the max changed around to
    more or less so that guilds can predict better.</li>
  <li>For epic 2.0 the final battle WILL be a raid (balanced to 54 people) If
    the raid succeeds at this step, you WILL receive the item needed at this
    step. It will not be chance as many epic 1.0's were.</li>
  <li>There may be "partial" epics (1.5) for more casual people to reach, without
    having to do the full final raid.</li>
  <li>Typical epic documents are 20-30 pages long. These will be epic.</li>
  <li>Epic 2.0s are being looked at carefully to ensure that there are of similar
    difficulty.</li>
  <li>There was a suggestion for more consumables for trade skills other than
    baking, brewing, and alchemy. The idea is for items with charges or whatever,
    for
    all trade skills, for a continual source of income for trade skills</li>
  <li>New Character models for the new graphics engine are in the works, but
    are far off from being even previewed, much less implemented.</li>
  <li>Except for specific accepted events, events will be tuned to last 2 hours
    on average, as the target length.</li>
  <li>There was a request to make some of the Kunark, and Velious "boss" mobs
    or "uber" mobs spawn more often than once a week.</li>
  <li>It was revealed that point expenditure for GoD AA was tuned to Plane of
    Fire experience gain rate.</li>
  <li>They will consider the "Flowing Thought" (mana regen) cap.</li>
  <li>There is a work in progress already to make the titles available in game
    choose able by the user. You will be able to choose from titles that you
    are eligible for. They will be adding titles for race and trade skills. There
    MAY be some combination titles, but they have not committed to those.</li>
  <li>There was in idea to add a "raid vendor" at the end of raid adventures
    and expeditions to allow for "higher" raid only prizes not available from
    the more public vendors.</li>
  <li>It was revealed that LDoN raids are only 30 points because the loot drops
    given during the raid were also considered part of the reward.</li>
  <li>I forwarded the idea that we want more solstice earring, and shawl type
     recipes and quests... it was given hearty approval by the players in the
    same group :)</li>
  <li>Another idea was forwarded (not by me) to have certain recipes be "loot".
    This would mean you have to earn the loot to make the item.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this last meeting we went to dinner, where we took over a room at a
  club/restaurant and mingled with each other and the developers. Maddoc even
  chose to sit next to me and put up with the firing line :) During this dinner
  we
  were given a document of initial plans. CLick on the image bellow to see it.<br />
  <a href="../images/articles/OfficialSummitSummarySmaller.jpg"><!--image_op:OfficialSummitSummaryThumb.jpg..77..100..0--></a><br />
  One thing to note.  The dev responsible for fixing the collision problems,
  is still working on it, and will continue to work on it. These plans will be
  assigned to other developers :)</p>
<p>All in all I got the idea that the developers really do want to make a game
  we want to play, so please, don't accuse the developers of ignoring the players,
  it never
  was them that was doing so!</p>

104 Niami Denmother May 16 Patch As <a href=\"http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=16595\">promised last week</a>, a few tradeskill changes went in with yesterday\'s patch:
<ul>
<li>-There have been several upgrades to Gates Tradeskilled items.
<li>-Gates smithed weapons have been adjusted.
<li>-Gates fletched arrows have had their damage increased and are now magical.
<li>-Tradeskill drinks from Gates of Discord have had their duration enhanced.</ul>
<p>Another happy bit of info, at least in my eyes, is the fact that there\'s now a PoK stone to Gulf of Gunthak, making it easier on those making ribbons, potions and prismatic dyes (as well as on all the folks that hunt out there). 2004-06-17 12:35:09 0
105 Niami Denmother Singing the Birthday Blues We're not going to make him <a href="http://69.57.151.222/archive.html?150?#145">break down ore</a> (nor will we make him sing {shiver}).  We also won't <a href="http://www.gamergod.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=41">ask him about Denmark</a>. Hopefully, what we will do is band together to sing our beloved House Ogre, Ngreth, a happy birthday.  On second thought, mayhaps we could have the iksar just hiss along, instead of trying tae sing?  Hm.  On third thought, mayhaps we could all jus' wish him a happy birthday without the singing - I'm out of honeycomb for earplugs.  {wink}<p>

108 Krazick DB Master Database Turns **ONE** today <h3>This day in History</h3>
<p>There are websites out there that will give you some historical notes about what happened on any particular day of the year. And July 21 is a interesting day... One site tells me that on July 21 there were some interesting milestones occurred:</p>

<ul>
<li>1904 (100 years ago) Camille Jenatzy sets world auto speed record at 65.79 MPH</li>
<li>1954 (50 years ago) At Geneva, France agrees to independence of North & South Vietnam</li>
<li>1969 (35 years ago) Neil Armstrong steps on the Moon</li>
<li>1984 (20 years ago) 1st documented case of a robot killing a human in US (Is Will Smith onto something?)</li>
</ul>

<p>[Note there are lots more, I just selected a few]</p>

<p>So why do I bring this up today? It is simple, there is another milestone to add to the list, but it most likely will never be on par with any of these events...</p>

<blockquote><p>From September 8th through 11th RackNine will be making changes to its network architecture and short outages may affect portions of the network while traffic is re-routed to increase capacity. During this period trouble ticket and email support may be inaccessible and I?d recommend calling toll-free for any inquiries.</p>

 
<p>Once our network is upgraded we?ll be increasing our packages to reflect RackNine?s huge growth in network capacity, look for this and other exciting changes in future email.</p></blockquote> 2004-09-08 07:18:09 0

<h4>Details:</h4>
<p>Start by hailing Chamberlain Thoridain after having received the Blessed Underfoot Prayer Shawl.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'You have done well on your first trial but so far there has been no reaction from Brell. While this is unexpected, we should continue if we hope to accomplish anything. Are you ready to [begin] the second trial?'</p>
<p>You say, 'begin'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Will it Live?'.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Very well. This trial will have you working with various types of Cosgrove Clay to create some simple statues. We will even see if you can bring life to them. I have given you a tool you will need during part of the quest. If you loose it you can ask me for another [tool], but please be careful, it takes time to make each tool. Good luck!'</p>
 
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain will give you a Pure Water collecting tool. No stats, goes in primary.</p>
 
<p>You are going to need to travel to the Foundation. In the farm not far from the zone in is Foreman Gribblebitz.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Foreman Gribblebitz'</p>
<p>Your task 'Will it Live?' has been updated.</p>
<p>Foreman Gribblebitz says 'What? Oh, you are one of them. And Thoridain sent you? Well. Oh Clay. Yes, yes, here you go.'</p>
 
<p>This will get you the Gribblebitz clay sample. Next you will want to go ahead and ask him about the clay as well.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'what clay'</p>
<p>Foreman Gribblebitz says 'Oh no! You have been destroying the golems for their clay? No! That will not do! They are important! Here, take this sample tool and get your clay sample that way. What is wrong with all of you people? The first thing you want to do is destroy! If you have not been destroying them, I apologize for my assumptions, but you see what I am dealing with all of the time!'</p>
 
<p>He will give you a clay sampling device. This device will allow you to retrieve the sample from a clay golem. While next to a clay golem, you can use the device, be warned they will attack as well as any other mobs around them. This will give you the golem clay sample.</p>
 
<p>If you run around the west side of Foundation, over the small little pits, eventually you will get one that pops an item onto your cursor. This is the Foundation clay sample.</p>
 
<p>Also over on the west area of Foundation you will find plenty of cliknar mobs. Simply kill them until you get one to drop a cliknar claimed clay sample and loot it.</p>
 
<p>The pure water collection tool requires to be sterilized before it can be used each time. To do this, you combine the Pure water collection tool with a vodka in a kiln. This creates a Sterilized Pure Water Collecting Tool. Also, you will need to bring idol sketches, sculpting tools, and high quality firing sheets with you to Brell's Temple. The combines for the statues must be done on the pottery wheel and kiln located in Brell's Temple. They are in the main room that Brell paces around on the west side of the room.</p>
 
<p>From that central room, you will need to clear the mobs in the first room to the west of Brell's room. There is 1 roamer and 4 static spawns. Once all 4 static spawns are dead, simply walk up to the center area, and the clay of cosgrove should appear on your cursor. With all 5 clay samples you will need to clear to the east of the central room. There are 4 static spawns in this room as well. When all are dead, simply walk into the water fountain/pool in the middle of the room with a sterilized pure water collection tool. You will get a vial of purest water and the collection tool back. Run back to the kiln and resterilize your tool and run back. Repeat this until you have all 5 vials of the purest water. Now go over to the pottery wheel in the main central room. Combine an idol sketch + scultping tools + a vial of purest water with each of the 5 clay samples. You will craft 5 unfired clay statues. Next simply fire them in Brell's Temple in the kiln with a high quality firing sheet. Once you have fired all 5 statues, you turn them in to Chamberlain Thoridain. Once you have turned in all 5, simply put on your Blessed Underfoot Prayer Shawl and hail Chamberlain Thoridain again then turn it in to him.</p>
 
<p>If you were to fail one of the combines on the statues, you can simply hail Chamberlain Thoridain and he will give you the replacements so you do not have to recollect them from mobs.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Great. Give me your Blessed Underfoot Prayer Shawl, and I will give you your next shawl.'</p>
<p>Your task 'Will it Live?' has been updated.</p>
<p>Your task 'Will it Live?' has been updated.</p>
<p>You have expanded your knowledge of the clay of cosgrove.</p>
<p>You gain experience!!</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Yes, you have done very well. Not only did you learn that the clay that comes to Brell's Temple is special, you also offered a prayer to Brell just in the act of creating in his presence. Here is your new shawl.'</p>
 
<p>At this point you will receive the <!--item_linkedname:37489-->.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'While your skills with the Clay of Cosgrove were impressive, it has not moved the Creator. I must admit I have some doubts as to the chances of success but even so, we must try. Are you [willing] to test your skills in the third trial?'</p>
<p>You say, 'willing'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Sewing it Forward'.</p>

125 CleavingWarlord Cleaving the Warlord - A Poem by Nherko E. Llafsnot <p>
If ye have bested Tallon, <br />
 and Vallon, too (or not?), <br />
 then get thee down to Eriak, <br />
 and there ask him, "What blood?" 
</p>
<p>
He'll draw his blade and cut himself, <br />
 and spill for you his own, <br />
 now take this vial, mount your steed, <br />
 and ride to Saryrn's zone. 
</p>
<p>
Find you there her constructs, <br />
 of which there are four breeds, <br />
 Insanity Fangs they'll drop for you-- <br />
 these stasify your needs. 
</p>
<p>
Into the barrel--fangs and blood, <br />
 celestial solvent, too, <br />
 to get one of the tempers, <br />
 proceed you now to brew. 
</p>
<p>
Now off to Valor go with haste, <br />
 and ride up to the swamp, <br />
 o'er everything that spawns up there, <br />
 shall you proceed to romp. 
</p>
<p>
Valorium shards, no drop, take these! <br />
 but whatever you do, <br />
 be sure the one that takes 'em, <br />
 is someone who can brew. 
</p>
<p>
Then ride again to Knowledge, <br />
 and then much like before, <br />
 except without the blood, of course, <br />
 brew up one temper more. 
</p>
<p>
Now head on back to Tactics, <br />
 and take a bunch of friends, <br />
 for in its depths drops ore with which, <br />
 this Zek-Bane quest will end. 
</p>
<p>
Tagrin Maldric spawns down there, <br />
 a troll both big and bad, <br />
 kill him there--but not too fast! <br />
 because you'll need his adds. 
</p>
<p>
Smiths will loot his guardians, <br />
 these flying swords--Decorins, <br />
 then (with water) find a forge, <br />
 to put Decorin ore in. 
</p>
<p>
Drunder's Steel--that's the thing, <br />
 with which you'll end this trial-- <br />
 into the forge with proper molds, <br />
 and aforebrewed blue vial. 
</p>
<p>
Almost done! It's good so far, <br />
 but there is more to do! <br />
 forge it now with your black vial, <br />
 and so your quest concludes. 
</p>
<p>

<h4>Details:</h4>
<p>Upon zoning into Brell's Temple with your prayer shawl, you receive an emote.</p>
 
<p>"Chamberlain Thoridain says 'I sense a sacred relic of Brell on your person. If you would like to know more about this relic, come speak to me.'"</p>
 
<p>Chamblerlain Thoridain is located in the central room near Brell Serilis.</p>
<p>Hailing him starts the following dialogue.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Greetings upworlder, and welcome to the Temple of Brell. As soon as you entered the temple I could sense the energy of a sacred relic, though I am unable to determine which one. Would you be willing to [show] me the relic you possess?'</p>
<p>You say, 'show'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'A Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl! That brings back memories of my life in Thurgadin. Many ages ago, I served Brell there as a priest, much as I do now in His temple. The Thoridain family was responsiblefor testing those aspiring to the highest ranks of the shawl. Very few reached that point, and almost none ever attained what you now hold in your hands. To have earned such a relic of Brell is unheard of for one who is not a [Coldain].'</P>
<p>You say, 'coldain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'We consider ourselves to be His most devoted servants. In the time I have spent here, many new wonders were created. My understanding of the will of Brell expanded and was able to realize how much more we were capable of honoring our creator. With this new insight, I was inspired to devise a new series of trials for the devoted. Those who prove their worth would be rewarded new, more powerful shawls as symbols of their increasing [devotion to Brell].'</p>
<p>You say, 'devotion to brell'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain looks pained and says 'Despite our new devotion to Brell, something changed recently and he no longer speaks to us. He is consumed entirely with the creation of something and never leaves the workshop anymore. Perhaps we could help each other here. If you were willing to undertake the new trials showing your devotion, it might turn his attention to you, and in turn you would receive a much improved shawl for each trial you pass. Would you like to begin the first [trial]?'</p>
<p>You say, 'trial'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Still Hungry'.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Excellent! Although we are spirits and no longer require food, we still remember the wonderful taste. There are several whom I would like you to visit. Find out what food they would most like to have and prepare it for them. Although this may seem pointless, the effect on their spirits will be tremendous. Hopefully such an act of goodwill toward His followers will not go unnoticed.'</p>
 
<p>The first NPC is Dorrvix. Dorrvix is located in the gnoll camp in Brell's Rest.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Dorrvix'</p>
<p>Your task 'Still Hungry' has been updated.</p>
<p>Dorrvix says 'You want know what Dorrvix want? Dorrvix want food. Dorrvix want Brell's [Bounty] [cooked] right way.'</p>
<p>You say, 'bounty'</p>
<p>Dorrvix says 'To make good cooked Brell's Bounty you need good Brell's Bounty, sauces, and spices. Don't forget steam best way to cook.'</p>
<p>You say, 'cooked'</P>
<p>Dorrvix says 'Yes. [Steam] only way. Other way cook too much.'</p>
<p>You say, 'steam'</p>
<p>Dorrvix says 'Dorrvix no know. You find steam. Maybe stick head in lava!'</p>
 
<p>Brell's Bounty are common ground spawns all throughout Brell's Rest and Cooling Chambers as well as can be foraged in the UF expansion. To prepare the brell's bounty you need to combine it in a mixing bowl with a water flask. The steam he speaks of is a drop from the elemenals in Brell's Rest, Essence of Steam. It is flagged as a quest item and used in tradeskills and is tradeable. Make the brell's bounty steam steaks in an oven/spit and hand it in to Dorrvix. Upon handing the item in to Dorrvix, you get the task to update and 
Dorrvix says 'Good good! Look good! Dorrvix eat. You go away now.'</p>
 
<p>Next you need to go to Cooling Chambers and speak with Talbot Roaringhead. Talbot is located in the 2nd room of dwarves.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Talbot Roaringhead'</p>
<p>Your task 'Still Hungry' has been updated.</p>
<p>Talbot Roaringhead says 'Chamberlain Thoridain sent you to me to ask what I desire? That man deservers your respect, he is a great soul. Be sure you always speak to him with respect and speak of him well. What I desire will not be the easiest thing for you to get, it will even require that you go back to my homeland to retrieve a particular [egg].'</p>
<p>You say, 'egg'</p>
<p>Talbot Roaringhead says 'Yes. I long for the taste of snow griffon eggs. I know it is asking much of you, but it would really raise my spirits. If you will take on this task, I have a particular way to [cook] this that would be ideal and has never been done before.'</p>
<p>You say, 'cook'</p>
<p>Talbot Roaringhead says 'Take a single snow griffon egg and mix it with spices, neutralized goo acid and caveflower pollen. The neutralized acid will help the frothiness of the egg, and give a slight salt taste. The pollen will give a faint hint of honey to the overall dish. You should be able to find the neutralized acid and caveflower pollen within the cooling chamber.'</p>
 
<p>Snow griffin eggs if you recall were used in the first coldain shawl series and are an uncommon drop from the snow griffins that roam around the Eastern Wastes. These eggs are no drop. The caveflower pollen is a no drop, lore ground spawn near the zone in of cooling chambers. It is under a light producing flower at the bottom of the ramp that leads back out to Brell's Rest. It is not a very long respawn timer and if you bring a spit with you, along with the eggs and spices you can pick a few of them up while hunting the goos near the zone in for the acid. The neutralizing goo acid is an uncommon to rare drop from any goo model in the zone it is tradeable. Upon handing one of the divine snow griffin souffles in to Talbot, you receive the following message.</p>
 
<p>Talbot Roaringhead says 'Oh my. That is most excellent. I must commend you on a job well done. It is so well executed that I insist you share this with my foremen. I know that may not have been part of the original deal and may inconvenience you, but I truly insist.'</p>
 
<p>You now must deliver a souffle to each of the 3 foreman located in the cooling chambers. Simply head down the 2 paths and locate the 3 foreman. South path takes you to the upper foreman and deeper in will be the lower foreman by the lake. The middle foreman is down the east path from Talbot.</p>
<p>Once you hand all 3 in you are now ready to move on to the Underquarry and find Yolgund Murkwader.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Yolgund Murkwader'</p>
<p>Your task 'Still Hungry' has been updated.</p>
<p>Yolgund Murkwader says 'So. The uppity Chamberlain Thordain sent ya to find what I desire. I desire a bit o' a break. Yes, I do enjoy the work, but I still need a break. I do nae forsee that happening, so perhaps I can kill two bugs with one weapon, and ye be my weapon. I desire ale marinated [cliknar] claws.'</p>
<p>You say, 'cliknar'</p>
<p>Yolgund Murkwader says 'The cliknar have turned into a scourge upon the underfoot. While I have never tasted their meat, I am willing to try it for the fact that you will need to kill some to make it. Take 3 claws, and marinate them in double brewed double stout dwarven ale and spices.'</p>
 
<p>Head into the southern stonequarry and then east into the silver mines of the Underquarry and you will find the cliknar. The models that stand up right with 4 arms have the chance to drop the intact cliknar claws, tradeable item. Then you need to brew or get a bottle of 2x brewed 2x stout dwarven ale. The easiest place I found was to go to Crescent Reach on the main floor as all the components are sold by vendors there to make the ale. Combine 3 of the claws with 1 of the ales and some spices in an oven or spit and return to the Underquarry and hand it in to Yolgund.</p>
 
<p>Your task 'Still Hungry' has been updated.</p>
<p>Yolgund Murkwader says 'Thank you. I will try this later. While it does not look appetizing, it does smell rather good.'</p>
 
<p>The next step is to find Turuff the Warrior in Kernagir, the Shining City. From the zone in you head NW to the first building and inside you go around the corner and will find a circle of about 10-12 NPCs. Turuff is a kobold standing by a pillar facing into the circle.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Turuff the Warrior'</p>
<p>Your task 'Still Hungry' has been updated.</p>
<p>Turuff the Warrior says 'Turuff desire good [meat].'</p>
<p>You say, 'meat'</p>
<p>Turuff the Warrior says 'Turuff smart. Turuff know you know what best meat is and Turuff no need to tell you. You no trick Turuff. You know [gravy] as well.'</p>
<p>You say, 'gravy'</p>
<p>Turuff the Warrior says 'Yes. The gravy is good. Use much gravy. Be sure you chop meat too.'</p>
<p>The meat he desires is horse meat. You can find horse meat in PoR zones, Theater of Blood or Elddar Forest. You will need to grill the horse meat, combine in a mixing bowl, horse meat with a grilling sauce. The gravy he is referring to is brown gravy. This is made from vendor sold components, again I recommend Crescent Reach as it has all the components in the same zone. The gravy is made in an oven or spit and then you combine the grilled horse meat with 2 brown gravy and to chop it, you use a filleting knife. This is a crafted tool that is returned on success. Return to Kernagir and hand the Turuff's Favorite Meat back into Turuff.</p>
 
<p>Your task 'Still Hungry' has been updated.</p>
<p>Turuff the Warrior says 'See Turuff told you Turruf smart. Turuff find good person to make Turuff favorite food.'</p>
 
<p>Now you must go to Brell's Temple and in the central hub area where Brell Serilis paces you will find Master Alchemist Vakros.</p>

<p>Your task 'Still Hungry' has been updated.</p>
<p>Master Alchemist Vakros says 'Hello hello. Desire. But desire is not logical. But I can work with it anyway. I know what I desire. I desire a [Geerlok hypermodulating endospaning exotool].'</p>
<p>You say, 'Geerlok hypermodulating endospaning exotool'</p>
<p>Master Alchemist Vakros says 'Oh. You want to know what food I desire? How disappointing. Could you instead get me an [Ambleshift augmenting automator]?'</p>
<p>You say, 'ambleshift augmenting automator?'
Master Alchemist Vakros says 'Ok. Just food. I know. [Clockwork Stew].'</p>
<p>You say, 'clockwork stew'</p>
<p>Master Alchemist Vakros says 'You don't know how to make it? Well. You need to get organic clockwork oil, and then cook a clockwork balance gear in with grilled minotaur meat and vegetables in a pot. Are you sure you can handle that? Wait. Don't answer. You obviously do not have the skills. I won't count on getting it. Why did you even ask?'</p>
 
<p>Now you need to go back to Kernagir, the Shining City and kill any clockwork models throughout the zone to get the drops, organic clockwork oil and clockwork balance gear, both are tradeable. Minotaur meat can be found by killing minotaurs anywhere in Norrath, I recommend some place like Dragonscale Hills as it is fairly common there and tradeable. Combine the items together in an oven or spit and return to Brell's Temple to Vakros.</p>
 
<p>Your task 'Still Hungry' has been updated.</p>
<p>Master Alchemist Vakros says 'See. I told you you could do it. One should never doubt oneself. Thank you, I am sure I will enjoy eating this.'</p>
 
<p>The next step in the task is to equip your Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl and hail Chamberlain Thoridain who is located in the same room as Vakros. </p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Great. Give me your Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl, and I will give you your next shawl.'</p>
<p>Your task 'Still Hungry' has been updated.</p>
 
<p>After you hail Chamberlain Thoridain you hand your blessed coldain prayer shawl in to him.</p>

<h4>Details:</h4>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'While your skills with the Clay of Cosgrove were impressive, it has not moved the Creator. I must admit I have some doubts as to the chances of success but even so, we must try. Are you [willing] to test your skills in the third trial?'</p>
<p>You say, 'willing'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Sewing it Forward'.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Very good then. This trial will have you creating some necessary components of the shawls you have been receiving. These pieces will be used for any devoted followers who undertake these trials after you. Brell always looks kindly on those who help his devoted followers.'</p>
 
<p>This task starts out listing all the items you need to collect. Once you have collected all of the parts to make the items it unlocks the task steps for you to create the items. The task requires you to loot a certain amount, if you have completed that step and you fail a combine and need more, you can get the items from a vendor or another person if they are tradeable to replenish your supplies but you do have to do the initial looting. When you start the task, you will receive the Glacial Slush Water Collector.</p>
 
<p>Woven Fur Padding:</p>
<p>Downy Gnoll Fur drops off of any gnolls in Brell's Rest. They have a camp on the west side of the zone. Downy Kobold Fur drops off of any kobold in Brell's Rest. They have a camp on the east side of the zone. I would estimate it is about a 1 in 10 drop rate for these. When you start the task, you will receive the Glacial Slush Water Collector. This device is used to collect the glacial slush water from the cooling chamber. Go to the deepest part of the zone, where all the undead are by the lake. IVU is a big help. Find the largest iceberg in the lake, stand at the highest point, remove any levitation effects and jump off to the east into the water. Dive down slightly so that you are not floating near the surface, but do not swim all the way to the bottom. Click the Glacial Slush Water Collector and you will get 1 Glacial Slush Water. There is a 1 minute reuse timer on the collector so you will be sitting there for a little while. If you have found the right spot, and you removed any levitation effects, you should remain in the spot so you can repeat the process to collect all the waters you need. Note: THESE WATERS ARE TEMPORARY. Bring your Downy Gnoll and Kobold Furs down with you and combine them after you collect all the waters. 1 Downy Gnoll OR Kobold Fur + 2 Glacial Slush Waters will create Frost Shocked Gnoll or Kobold Furs. Chamberlain Thoridiain warns you that you will lose 1 of 4 of these combines so it can be helpful to bring extras. Once you have 3 Frost Shocked Downy Gnoll Furs and 3 Frost Shocked Downy Kobold Furs, combine them in your sewing kit to create the Woven Fur Padding.</p>
 
<p>Wing Vein Boning:</p>
<p>Pristine Mephit Wing Veins drop off of "a deranged mephit" in Lichen Creep. I would estimate these at a 1 in 10 drop rate. The deranged mephits can spawn in the place of any mephit in the zone so you may have to clear a bit to get enough drops. Stonegrind Solvent is a very common drop off of the goo's in the lower section of The Cooling Chamber near the zoneline to Pellucid Grotto. They are not hard to kill and the drops are fairly common. The solvent is no trade so you will need to camp these if you fail a combine and need more. The wing veins are tradeable so after looting your 4 you can get extras from others. Combine 2 of the wing veins with 2 of the solvents in your sewing kit to create the bonings. You need 2 bonings.</p>
 
<p>Underfoot Silk Panel:</p>
<p>Head to Fungal Forest. Find any spider mob, I found them most commonly on the west side of the zone closer to Pellucid Grotto. Any spider mob will drop between 1 and 5 Loam Tainted Spider Silks every time. These are fairly easy to collect and just require killing enough spiders. The Loam Tainted Slime drops from the oozes in the southern part of the zone. There are 2 versions of Loam Tainted Slime. The only one that will update the loot step of the task and can be used in the combines drop from a specific ooze "vigorous earth". These spawn in the Hungry Earth camp near Excrug Shrivstem. The slimes drop at about a 1 in 3 drop rate. The silks and the slimes are tradeable so you can get extras from others after fulfilling the loot requirement should you fail a combine. Once you have all the slimes and silks you can begin sewing the silks and swatches together. To make a thread, you need 2 silks and 1 slime. To make a swatch you need 1 thread, 4 silks, and 1 slime. To make the panel you need 4 swatches and 2 threads. This totals to 28 silks and 10 slimes if you have no failures.</p>
 
<p>Turn in the Woven Fur Padding, the Wing Vein Bonings, and the Underfoot Silk Panel to Chamberlain Thoridain. Put your Revered Underfoot Prayer Shawl on and hail Chamberlain Thoridain.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Great. Give me your Revered Underfoot Prayer Shawl, and I will give you your next shawl.'</p>
 
<p>Hand in your shawl and receive <!--item_linkedname:37581--> and 5aa.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Ah yes. Very good. Service to others, and sharing of your craft is important to Brell.'</p>
 
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'The craftsmanship of the previous pieces you created was outstanding. Even though nothing has changed with Brell, we will press on. Are you prepared to [accept] the fourth trial?'</p>
<p>You say, 'accept'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Bring Him a Brew!'</p>

<h4>Details:</h4>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'The craftsmanship of the previous pieces you created was outstanding. Even though nothing has changed with Brell, we will press on. Are you prepared to [accept] the fourth trial?'</p>
<p>You say, 'accept'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Bring Him a Brew!'</p>
 
<p>The first step in this task is to create a Brell's Best. This recipe is explained in the book, Brewing Brell's Best, sold on the Useful Automated Vendor in Brell's Rest. Return to Thoridain and hail him,</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Your task 'Bring Him a Brew!' has been updated.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'I see your talent at brewing is not understated. Hold on to that brew since we'll be using it as a base. Now we will begin your trial in earnest. Here is a magical water sampling jar. Travel to the areas I have indicated and collect a sample of water from each. There is likely only one suitable water supply in each area so you may need to do some searching. Be sure you do not lose the jar as I will want it back when you are done.'</p>
 
<p>You receive Magical Water Collection Jar. It is an inventory clickable item, 0.5 sec cast time that will collect water samples and duplicate itself, allowing unlimited collecting of samples.</p>
 
<p>Now you must travel to each of the zones indicated and collect a sample of water.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Brell's Rest, the steaming pool with the elementals is the proper location. Run in/near/there and click the collection jar. You will receive a sample. Clicking the jar does remove invisibility when you receive the water sample. Simply wait for the pather to move away and you can find a spot in the middle near the cooling chamber zone pit.</li>
<li>In the Cooling Chamber, the location is the lake all the way at the bottom with the undead. Run with invis/ivu down to the lake and find a spot in the water with no mobs around.</li>
<li>In the Underquarry, the location is the small lake in the main quest NPC room near the genari. Stay on the opposite side of the water from them and you can collect the sample without aggro.</li>
<li>In the Foundation, you will need to head east from the zone in to the next section and there is a small lake with some autarchians and baelorats around it.</li>
<li>In Pellucid Grotto, the lake in the far northwest corner of the zone is where you need to go where the memory crystals spawn around the lake. Move towards the middle of the lake to find a safe spot.</li>
<li>In Arthicrex, there is a small puddle in the ravine near the Underquarry zone in. There are 2-3 cliknar and 2-3 oozes that spawn near there that can see invis, be careful.</li>
<li>In Fungal Forest, there is a small pond near the east end of the zone with mephits all around it. Rarely will a mephit ganger see through invis so simply approach from a different side from them and can collect the sample near the middle of the lake.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Once you have all of the water samples, you need to create the Pure Underfoot Spirits. To do this, combine the 7 water samples you have collected in a brew barrel with a cask, barley, and yeast. Once you have this, you now must collect the Jelly of the Cliknar Queen. This is a ground spawn in Arthicrex deep in the Hive in the northern end of the zone. Go up the switchbacks to enter the hive area, be careful there are see-invis mobs along this path. Once at the top, go into the hive and down towards the bottom. The very bottom room has 2 tables with colored jars. Going up from the bottom to the 2nd path from the bottom leads to another room where the Hive Nurse spawns there are some additional tables with colored jars stacked on them. The ground spawn is ON one of the tables and it is a large vial that is yellow and sparklie. Several see-invis mobs are in the room as well as other trash mobs. Nothing sees through SoS. Once you have reached the room, either clear the mobs, or use some form of invulnerability to run in and grab the ground spawn is the best suggestion I can give. It was not easy to obtain. After you have the jelly, you need to return to Chamberlain Thoridain and speak to him.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Your task 'Bring Him a Brew!' has been updated.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'I am glad to see you were able to procure this jelly. That was no easy task I'm sure. The last thing we will need is a Sacred Cask of Brell. We only use them for the most sacred brews. They are kept in cold storage in Kernagir. You should speak to Brewmeister Stiegl about obtaining one.</p>
 
<p>Now you need to head to Kernagir and find Brewmeister Stiegl.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Brewmeister Stiegl'</p>
<p>Brewmeister Stiegl says 'What do you want?'</p>
<p>You say, 'sacred cask of brell'</p>
<p>Brewmeister Stiegl says 'Oh yeah? Well I am not in the giving mood today. Get'em!'</p>
 
<p>When you say the key phrase to him, the normal mobs in his room will despawn and 5 "a coldain brewer" will spawn and attack you. You need to clear these mobs and then Brewmeister Stiegl will become active and attack. Defeat him and he will drop the Sacred Cask of Brell. They hit like normal Kernagir trash mobs. Upon the death of Brewmeister Stiegl, the normal trash mobs in the room respawn.</p>
 
<p>Now that you have the cask you are ready to create Brell's Mythical Brew. To do this you combine the Sacred Cask of Brell with the Pure Underfoot Spirits, Brell's Best, and Jelly of the Cliknar Queen, as well as Yeast, Malt, and Hops in a brew barrel. Then you take this mythical brew along with the water collection jar back to Chamberlain Thoridain. Hand in the jar, then the brew, and then wear your shawl, hail Chamberlain again and then turn your shawl in to receive the Blessed Sanctified Underfoot Prayer Shawl.</p>
 
<p>Upon handing in the Water Collection Jar:</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Thank you for returning this. It's very valuable and we would not want to be without it.'</p>
 
<p>Upon handing in the Brell's Mythical Brew:</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'This is incredible work! Never have I seen a brew as potent as this. I hope it will have some effect on the creator.'</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Great. Give me your Sacred Underfoot Prayer Shawl, and I will give you your next shawl.</p>
<p>Hand your Sacred Underfoot Prayer Shawl to Chamberlain Thoridain.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'You have done the brewers of Underfoot proud with your accomplishments today. Here is your new shawl with any augments you may have had in it.</p>
 
<p>At this point you will receive a shawl based upon your class.</p>
<p>Casters: <!--item_linkedname:37582-->
<br>Melee: <!--item_linkedname:37583--></p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Your brew was truly potent. I believe I saw some glimmer of recognition from Brell when I gave it to him. We may be getting through to him after all! We must move forward with the next trial. Are you [prepared]?</p>
<p>You say, 'prepared'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'I Hope You Can Hear This'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Good. Given the reaction to your brew, Brell may be receptive to further input. You will attempt to create the sacred prayer runes of Brell. Given the sacred nature of these runes, I am sure it will have some effect. Off you go!?</p>

<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Your brew was truly potent. I believe I saw some glimmer of recognition from Brell when I gave it to him. We may be getting through to him after all! We must move forward with the next trial. Are you [prepared]?</p>
<p>You say, 'prepared'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'I Hope You Can Hear This'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Good. Given the reaction to your brew, Brell may be receptive to further input. You will attempt to create the sacred prayer runes of Brell. Given the sacred nature of these runes, I am sure it will have some effect. Off you go!?</p>
 
<p>The first step is to find a place that has some fallen trees. The particular place you are looking for is in Pellucid Grotto in the northeast section of the zone in the cliknar area. Upon approaching the appropriate place, you will receive an emote that will cause the ground spawns to appear. There are some see invis cliknar in the area you will want to avoid. The ground spawns look like sticks with a couple green leaves on the ground around the downed trees. The fallen branches do not stack. You will need to collect 6 branches even though the task only calls for 2 for the first update. [2 branches for the tool, 3 branches to make the 6 wood panels (yield of 2), and 1 branch for the ornate trim] The ground spawns will respawn if you stay in the area so you can find one or 2 spots and just wait for them to pop again.</p>
 
<p>Intact Greken Spines drop from any greken model in Underfoot. Greken models are the nestlings in the lava in Brell's Rest and are also found in the lavapool in Convorteum. In Brell's Rest I was experiencing a drop rate of roughly 1 in 10. In Convorteum I had a much better drop rate closer to 1 in 3. I do not know if it was just good/bad luck with the RNG but I would estimate it is probably a 1 in 5 global drop rate for that NPC model. The spines are no drop and stack to 4. Combine 2 fallen branches and the 4 intact greken spines to create the Rune Carving Tools. This combine, and all the fletching combines for this task, can ONLY be done on the fletching table in Brell's Temple in the main room where Brell Serilis wanders. Now that you have your Rune Carving Tools, you need to find something to make the runes out of. Smooth Stones drop fairly commonly from oozes in Arthicrex, Fungal Forest, and Pellucid Grotto. I simply went back to the Hungry Earth camp in Fungal Forest and killed the oozes there and was not long to collect the 6 stones. Back to Brell's Temple.</p>
 
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Your task 'I Hope You Can Hear This' has been updated.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'I see you managed to create your rune carving tools and find some suitable stones. You are ready to begin carving the runes. Here are the patterns for our six prayer runes. Simply carve the pattern into the stone using your tools. Remember, this must be done using the fletching table here in Brell's workshop.'</p>
 
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain gives you the 6 rune patterns. They do not stack. The fletching table is right in that room, combine a stone with each of the patterns and your carving tools. The tools are returned on success. Once you have crafted all 6 of the runes you need to speak with Chamberlain Thoridain again. It updates the task but there is no dialogue. The task window now provides you with the recipes for the wood panels and the ornate trim. One fallen branch in the fletching table yields 2 wood panels. Create the 6 wood panels and then the ornate trim using the last of your 6 fallen branches and your carving tools. Now you can fashion the Rune Case using the wood panels, ornate trim, and your carving tools. The Rune Case does consume the carving tools. The Rune Case is a container so you will need to have a top level inventory spot available when you make this combine. Place the 6 Sacred Prayer Runes in the Rune Case and hit combine to create the Case of Runes. Hand the Case of Runes into Chamberlain Thoridain. Wear your Blessed Sanctified Underfoot Prayer Shawl and hail him and then turn your Blessed Sanctified Underfoot Prayer Shawl in.</p>
 
<p>Your task 'I Hope You Can Hear This' has been updated.</p>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Great. Give me your Blessed Sanctified Underfoot Prayer Shawl, and I will give you your next shawl.'</p>

<p>Your task 'I Hope You Can Hear This' has been updated.</p>

<p>You say, 'commence'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Honoring the Elements'.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'This task is the one of the most sacred rites in the temple. You must honor the elements of creation. You will begin by collection the essences of creation.

Normally these could be obtained peacefully but the current chaos in Underfoot requires you get them by force. Brell will understand the sacrifices were necessary.

<p>Collect all of the Essences. These ARE pre-lootable. Once you have all 35, you return to Chamberlain Thoridain and hail him to get the instructions on how to craft the gems.</p>

<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Very good. The next part of the trial will require access to the Font Chamber. If you have not yet assisted Gotonur in creating a keystone, you should speak to him now. If you already have the keystone then let us [proceed].'<p>
<p>You say, 'proceed'</p>
<p>Your task 'Honoring the Elements' has been updated.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'First you will need to make Cosgrove Amalgam by mixing some mercury and cosgrove powder. Then you will use this amalgam to fuse the essences you collected into a solid gem. However, to do this you will need the energy of the corresponding elemental font. Simply stand in the appropriate font for whichever essences you are attempting to fuse. If you are successful, you will create a raw gem from those essences. After that everything else should be quite simple.'<p>


<p>To craft the Cosgrove Amalgam, you need to combine a Mercury with a Cosgrove Powder. The amalgam does not stack. You will need 7 of these. To combine the essences with the amalgam you must be standing in the proper Font. The Fonts are located in the locked room inside Brell's Temple. To reach this room, you must be carrying the Keystone reward from the Brell's Temple mission and it will open the door just north of the main central room where Brell Serilis is located. Inside you will see 7 colored spheres over some bowls. Those are the Fonts. The color of the essences corresponds with the color Font you need to be standing in to complete the combine. I recommend dropping levitation effects, walking up the front side of the stand and dropping into the bowl of the proper Font. You will need a collapsed or reinforced jewelry kit to make these 6 item combines. Combine the 5 essences with an amalgam in the proper font. If you are not close enough to the bowl, you will receive a message saying you must be closer to the font of XXX depending on which essence/color you are trying to make. Once you create the uncut gems in the Fonts, you will need to cut them. Oval cut tools and a Jewelers Glass in your JC kit. Once you have all 7 Brilliant gems, you will need to combine them with an Enchanted bar of Cosgrite on the Jewelry Making Bench located in the main room with Brell Serilis. Then you simply need to hand in the Clasp of the Elements to Chamberlain Thoridain, wear your shawl and hail him and then turn in your Revered Sanctified Underfoot Prayer Shawl.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain'</p>

<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Your honoring of the elements was a success! Brell seemed to be watching you as you worked. However, I have only one trial left. I hope it will be enough. Will you [undertake] the seventh trial?' </p>
<p>You say, 'undertake'</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridain says 'Excellent! You will create some of the finest and hardest silver you have ever seen. This silver is blessed from the fires of the heart of the underfoot itself. You will make a filigree to use in the shawls, making them themselves an item of devotion to Brell.'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'The Temper of Silver'.</p>

<p>When you request the task, you are given the Silver Filigree Pattern that you will need for the final combine.  At this point you need to go to Underquarry and kill a cliknar mine worker to get two Raw Underfoot Silvers and a burynai plotter drops the Raw Underfoot Copper.  Once you have these, combine them in a forge to make the refined metals and then combine them to make the Brell Silver.  At this point you are ready for the shawl walk in Convorteum.</p>
<p>Up the tunnel near the zone in is the clockwork npc.  Hail him and you can turn in the Brell Silver to begin.  The clockwork will walk down the path towards the field and test the lava in several places.  He will stop to attack any mob that gets near him as well.  He does decent dps and can tank a couple mobs at a time.  But if you let him run off on his own, he will die and you will have to recollect the drops.  Bring some friends and escort the gnome around to the 5 locations.  To begin, say ?start?.  At any time, you can say ?stop? and the clockwork will stay in place.  Saying ?continue? will make him resume on his way towards his next point.  Locations the clockwork walks to:</p>
<li>at Loc [-870,692,-76]</li>
<li>at Loc [-1195,595,-76]</li>
<li>at Loc [-978,665,-76]</li>
<li>at Loc [-671,704,-76]</li>
<li>at Loc [-466,735,-76]</li>

<p>When he reaches each spot, he will stop for a minute or so and then the task will update when he begins to move again.  At 3 of the 5 locations, while he is waiting at the lava, 2 mobs will spawn named, a ravenous greken.  Hit for about the same as normal Convorteum trash mobs.   Once he reaches his starting point, you will receive the Heart of the Underfoot used in the final combine.  There is a time limit to the walk that if you get an emote about the power level of the clockwork that is a warning about the timer.  Next, head back to Brell?s Temple and use the forge around the center room and combine the Heart of the Underfoot with the pattern to create the final item to turn in.  Turn the item into Chamberlain Thoridain and then hail.  Wear your shawl and hail then turn your Sacred Sanctified shawl in to receive the Blessed Serilis Prayer Shawl.</p>
<p>You say, ?Hail, Chamberlain Thoridain,?</p>
<p>Chamberlain Thoridan says, ?How wonderful.  Brell himself spoke to you.  Though he has not stopped in his task, it brings me great hope that he will soon stop what he is doing and go back to his normal self.  You have done more than I could ever hope for, and I thank you.  If you have a very large group of friends, there is one more thing that may bering even more of Brell?s attention.  I will not think less of you if you cannot complete this task.  If you are [interested] bring me the head of the creature that has caused Brell to become distracted.  Also, if you are interested, you may [exchange your shawl] for a similar version of equal power.

45 EQTC:Quests:Luclin:Rallic Pack Rallic Pack <p>
<i>This quest produces a 10-slot, 85% weight reduction, container that can hold giant-sized items. </i>
</p> 
<p>
Speak with Rallik in the city of Katta Castellum; he's located in the building resembling a church, with a hedge around it, right next to the Tenebrous zone (loc -101, -39). Enter the building, take the left hall to the end, turn left, he'll be the door on the left. He was indifferent to be as a Tribunal-worshipping shaman, but KOS to a Cazic Thule monk. Hail him, follow the dialog, he asks you to bring back information from a courier. 
</p> 
<p>
The mob you want is called 'a grimling runner'. It can be found in the Tenebrous Mtns; it spawns on the south side of the zone, right along the wall. If you're coming from the Grimling Forest, turn left after you zone and hug the wall. For me, it spawned on the hill just before the first grimling mine, and pathed toward the mine. It drops a bag, the bag is LORE and NODROP, and not really a bag (it will fit in your bags, just make sure you have a medium sized slot available). Give the bag to Rallik, he will give you the (lore) rallic pack pattern. 
</p> 
<p>
Next you will need a perfect owlbear pelt. Many owlbears can be found in Hollowshade Moor at the owlbear caves. The loc is approximately 2000, 1000. 
</p> 
<p>
Finally you'll need to head to the newbie area of Shadeweaver's Thicket, just outside of Shar Vahl, or the newbie pit in Shar Vahl. You want shadeling silks, which you can get from xakra silkworms, or the lesser shades that roam in the northern part of Shadeweavers. You'll need 8 silks total to make 1 shade silk cord and 1 shade silk thread (2 silks = thread, 3 threads = cord). Combine cord, thread, pelt and pattern into a sewing kit (a coldain tanning kit also works) and you create a Rallic pack. Trivial is <=15

139 EQTC:Quests:Luclin:Seru Bane Seru Bane Weapons <p>
Weapons with the Seru Bane attribute are needed to be able to damage Lord Inquisitor Seru through normal melee. Procs on non bane weapons will land on him, but to keep up a continuous run of ?normal? melee damage, you need a Seru weapon with Bane DMG: Seru +# to be able to hit him. 
</p> 
<p>
Lord Inquisitor Seru is located in Sanctus Seru, and all of the items needed to make Seru Bane weapons are located in various zones of the SoL expansion. You will be traveling around and camping various things to make these weapons, so do not expect it to be as simple as making things such as normal forged weapons. 
</p> 
<p>
<strong>The original text for making the Seru Bane weapons: </strong>
</p> 
<p>
Book 1: <br />
 <u>Day 1</u><br />
 Today is a great day, so I shall begin this journal. The High Inquisitor has called for my skilled hand to create for him a set of armor, which cannot be pierced by any weapon. This is to be my last chance to be in good grace with Lord Seru, though I have denounced Katta I assume they can still sense that I miss my family. Regardless, I shall begin working with the materials that were supplied to me in the morning. 
</p> 
<p>
<u>Day 2</u><br />
 Creation is going steady; the ore is melting to my expectations. This metal, which I have named Yttrium, should not be able to be pierced. I have sent for items to help tint the armor as Lord Seru requests. 
</p> 
<p>
<u>Day 10</u><br />
 With the greaves complete I begin working on the Breastplate soon. I have discovered how to make perfect Yttrium Sheets so production should go faster. Mixing two bricks of Yttruim ore, with one Vial of Quicksilver Temper creates the perfect sheet. The Quicksilver Temper is a harder mixture though, I must request ingredients be brought to me often, they seem to be hard to come by. For the perfect hue I have been brewing one part Fungoid Sap, one part Meteor Dust, one part Shissar Blood, and one part Shiknar Ichor. I do not know where the Consillium of the Hand is acquiring these ingredients, nor do I care, as long as I can present Lord Seru with a fine set of armor. 
</p> 
<p>
<u>Day 18</u><br />
 I have finished Lord Seru's Breastplate and just returned from presenting the Praesertum with it. They shall take it to him soon, so I should get word in a week. I shall wait to see if this is enough to please Lord Seru. I shall begin work on weapons that can match the armor, in the case that it doesn't. 
</p> 
<p>
<br />
 Book 2: <br />
<u>Day 22</u><br />
 Success! I have created an entire arsenal that should be able to strike through his armor. I had the most success using the following: A Pommel Mold, Hilt Mold, one Vial of Quicksilver Temper, one Yttrium Steel Sheet, and either a Dagger, Short, Curved, or Long Blade mold created a fine blade. An Oak Shaft, one Vial of Quicksilver Temper, one Yttrium Steel Sheet, and either a Mace, Hammer, or Axe Head Mold created heavier, powerful weapons. For a powerful set of gloves, I used two High Quality Rockhopper Pelts, one Vial of Quicksilver Temper, and one Yttrium Steel Sheet. A bow made with an Oak Bow Staff, a Silk String, a Planing Tool, one Yttrium Sheet Metal, and one Vial of Quicksilver Temper imbues any arrow shot from it with the same properties. Should I be banished, I will create these weapons for Recuso to destroy Seru. 
</p> 
<p>
<u>Day 25</u><br />
 The inevitable has happened. My time for the question has arisen, even though too soon. I failed because of my longing for my family Katta. I know their ways are wrong but I of course still love them. I write into this log from a land of destitution, I have been named a Recuso. 
</p> 
<p>
<u>Day 49</u><br />
 A few days ago in search of shelter from the rain I stumbled inside this place. What is this place... my nightmares become reality. I feel as though I am being watched with every step. I can not remember the way out, I can not remember... anything. 
</p> 
<p>
Quicksilver Temper is brewed and trivial below 180. The Yttrium Steel Sheet has a high trivial somewhere above 250. Both of these items are droppable. The final combines' trivial levels are in the mid to upper 100s. The final weapons are no drop, so you have to produce them yourself. 
</p> 
<p>
<strong>Combines in brief: </strong><br />
 A VIAL OF QUICKSILVER TEMPER: shissar blood + shiknar ichor + fungoid sap + meteor dust <br />
 YTTRIUM SHEET METAL: 2 small bricks of yttrium ore + quicksilver temper 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Shissar blood can be found on the snake-type shissar mobs in Luclin, mainly in Ssra. temple, and also available in the grey. </li> 
<li> Fungoid sap is only dropped off An Ancient Shrieker, which resides in the Deep. There are a couple of camps of them on the far side of the invisible bridge. They are KoS and assist each other. Drop rate is said to be uncommon-rare. </li> 
<li> Meteor dust is found mainly in the Grey, from Shattered golems, shissar style mobs, and rarely from the skeleton version of the sun revenants. </li> 
<li> Shiknar ichor is found on the Shik'nar bug type mobs in Fungus grove. Any form of Shik'nar insect can drop it.

46 EQTC:Quests:Luclin:SHTrading Shadow Haven - Register for Trading <p>
<i>While this quest is not really a tradeskill quest, it is an important one for tradesfolk who wish to operate out of the Shadow Haven area. The quest results in an Amulet of the Haven (magic, lore, no drop): AC 1, CHA 2. It also adjusts several factions in the area, making it easier to shop there. Some merchants will still be dubious after completing the quest, so you may need to loop it several times (or do other quests) before you can shop with all the merchants.</i>
</p> 
<p>
It starts in Shadow Haven with Trade Commissioner Henry, after you hail him ...
</p> 
<p>
Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Hello there, traveler. I don't believe that I have seen you around these parts before- then again, I could have and simply forgotten since there have been so many new faces around here. However, if you are a newcomer to Shadowhaven, please make sure that you [register for trading] in the Haven. Registering with the Traders of the Haven will legitimize you in the eyes of local merchants and customers. 
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'register for trading'
</p> 
<p>
Trade Commissioner Henry says 'It's great that you are interested _____, you will surely be glad you did. I have some simple deliveries that I need completed if you wish to be a registered trader in Shadowhaven. 
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'what deliveries?'
</p> 
<p>
Trade Commissioner Henry says 'The deliveries are simple enough, I just need you to bring some letters to some merchants of the Haven that are currently working in other locations. Will you [deliver these letters]? 
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'I will deliver these letters'
</p> 
<p>
Trade Commissioner Henry says 'I surely do appreciate the help, _____- clearly you understand the value of solid relations with the locals. First, I will need you to take this newsletter to Sateal. He is currently on assignment in the Bazaar and has been out of the loop on the happenings of Shadowhaven because of his heavy workload. Bring this to him and then return to me with his sales report. I look forward to seeing you soon. 
</p> 
<p>
Receive a newsletter and bring it to Sateal in The Bazaar (inside the large merchant area).
</p> 
<p>
Sateal Deirosap says 'Ah great, I have been meaning to go and pick one of these up from the Trade Commissioner but I have been very busy with my work. I'm sure Henry has been waiting for my sales report so here it is. Please return it to him for me if you could and thanks again! 
</p> 
<p>
<i>(You receive only experience for this portion of the quest.)</i>
</p> 
<p>
Receive sales report and bring it back to Trade Commissioner Henry.
</p> 
<p>
Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Great to see you back so soon _____, you looked like a dependable person from the start. The next thing I need you to do is a bit more dangerous, but by the looks of you I doubt it will be a problem. Go to the Shadowhaven outpost in Fungusgrove and give Thar this book. Thar is a great merchant but I have seen his sales steadily declining, so I figured this book full of selling tips will help him regain his confidence and help him produce the kinds of numbers I know he is capable of. If his economy report is ready please, bring that back to me when you return. 
</p> 
<p>
<i>(You receive only experience for this portion of the quest.)</i>
</p> 
<p>
Receive book of selling tips and take to Thar Anton in the merchant area of Fungus Grove.
</p> 
<p>
Thar Anton says 'I see you have brought a book from the Commissioner. Well I'm not much for reading but I will surely try anything that may increase my sales. Anyways I'm sure you arent that interested in how bad my sales are and would like to be on your way so here you go. 
</p> 
<p>
<i>You receive experience and gain faction with Traders of the Haven, House of Fordel, House of Midst and House of Stout</i>
</p> 
<p>
Receive Thar's report and return it to Trade Commissioner Henry.
</p> 
<p>
Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Excellent work _____, I knew that you were someone that I could trust to get the job done. The trader's union of Shadowhaven will hear of your solid work ethic. Perhaps a courier job is in your future, I couldn't have expected anyone to make these deliveries as fast as you did! Please take this amulet as a symbol of your dedication to Shadowhaven's booming economy. While wearing this you are sure to get all the greatest deals from the merchants of the Haven both here and in the bazaar. It was a pleasure meeting, you and thanks for all of your help. 
</p> 
<p>
<i>You receive experience, gain faction with Traders of the Haven, House of Fordel, House of Midst and House of Stout plus receive the Amulet of the Haven. Since the amulet is lore, if you decide to loop this quest, you will receive a duplicate lore message when you hand in Thar's report, but you will still receive the faction adjustments. </i>

47 EQTC:Quests:Luclin:SonicWolfBane Shar Vahl - Sonic Wolf Bane Weapons <p>
<i>This quest requires the cooperation of all five Vah Shir classes, and requires that they have first completed their class-specific quests. It results in the creation of a weapon, and then sends you back to your guild for further questing.</i>
</p> 
<p>
<i>A question that has been often raised is: "Can one character do all the parts to the quest themselves?" No. You must be of the proper class in order to complete the class-specific quests leading up to this quest. Additionally, non Vah Shir can multiquest the citizenship quest and loop until they have enough faction to attempt various Shar Vahl quests, but for the class-specific quests, they may only complete the one for their own character class. (The other guilds will not allow them to complete their quests.)</i>
</p> 
<p>
<i>You'll also find several spots where details are sketchy. If you can help fill in the gaps, please <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=19">post details to the message boards</a>.</i>
</p> 
<p>
After each young Vah Shir completes their <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=q42&menustr=120070000000">citizenship quest</a>, their guild master starts them on a progressive set of tradeskill quests. Each class is directed toward a different tradeskill. Beastlords are assigned <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=q75&menustr=120070000000">tailoring tasks</a>, rogues are assigned <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=q76&menustr=120070000000">baking tasks</a>, shamen are given <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=q77&menustr=120070000000">brewing tasks</a>, warriors are set to <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=q78&menustr=120070000000">smithing</a>, and bards <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=q74&menustr=120070000000">create pottery</a>. 
</p> 
<p>
When each class completes all their assigned tasks, they are given a special no drop item (Rogues, Warriors and Bards recieved a no drop Hilt; Shaman recieve a no drop Shaft; Beastlords recieve a no drop claw) and sent to create their sonic wolf bane weapon (and, presumably, help those who help them to create their own weapons as well). This requires the assistance of Vah Shir from all other character classes, as each has to create an item that goes into the final weapon combine.
</p> 
<p>
The final combine of hilt/claw with the other needed parts is made in a purchased Weapons Assembly Kit (sold by Arms Historian Qua). There is no skill check on the final combine, but there are skill checks for each of the class-specific combines listed below.
</p> 
<p>
All the drop items are found in <a href="<!--server:x-->sources/source_zone_page.php?article=g89&menustr=110000000000&sz=1171">Hollowshade Moor</a>. Unless noted otherwise the owlbear items drop off owlbear cubs and grapplers (not owlbears in the caves) and the sonic wolf items drop off wandering sonic wolves (not off the sonic wolves in the caves).
</p> 
<p>
It appears that the combines for each of the items listed below is trivial in between 130 and 140 in the appropriate tradeskill. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Beastlords must create <b>toughened sinew lashings</b>. Combine stretching dowel, owlbear tendons, sonic wolf tendons, kelp salts and fish oil soaked rags in any sewing kit to create toughened sinew lashings. Trivial for the combine is 135 tailoring. Owlbear tendons drop in Hollowshade Moor off the owlbear cubs and grapplers. Sonic wolf tendons appear to drop off any wandering sonic wolf in Hollowshade Moor. Kelp salts drop off the moor tortoises in Hollowshade Moor. Fish oil soaked rags are dropped off the grimling fisherman (and their chief), also in Hollowshade Moor. </li>
<li>Rogues must bake the <b>sonic wolf bane poison</b>. This requires: salass moss, tortoise saliva, sonic wolf blood, poison dart felt. Mix in these items in a no drop acrylia mortar & pestle. Combine the results with a posion vial and water in an oven<i>. </i>The digested salass moss is dropped off owlbear cubs and grapplers in Hollowshade Moor. The sonic wolf blood can drop off any wandering sonic wolf in Hollowshade Moor. The poison dart felts are dropped off the grimling spiritists in Hollowshade Moor. Toroise saliva is dropped off moor tortoises in, yep, you guessed it, Hollowshade Moor!</li>
<li>Shaman must brew a <b>reactive sealant soak</b>. This is done by combining blackened salt crystals, sonic wolf brain, crystalized ygri root, digested night palm, a water flask, and a <a href="<!--server:x-->items/show_item.php?item=5111">ceremonial strainer</a> (no drop) in a brew barrel. The blackened salt crystals are dropped off grimling mystics in Hollowshade Moor. Sonic wolf brain can be dropped by any wandering sonic wolf in Hollowshade Moor. Crystalized ygri root is a ground spawn near the sonic wolf caves in Hollowshade Moor. Digested night palm drops off the owlbear cubs in Hollowshade Moor.</li>
<li>Warriors must smith a <b>porous dagger or claw blade</b> (based upon which class is receiving the final weapon). This requires bag of white sand (no drop), powdered wolf claws (no drop), sonic wolf blood (no drop), chunk of porous ore, water flask, and either a blade mold or a claw mold, depending on which item you are making. The chunk of porous ore is a ground spawn in Hollowshade Moor, reported to be "just before the bridge" in Hollowshade Moor, "left over the hill". The white sand drops off grimling fishermen and grimling mystics in Hollowshade Moor. Powered wolf claws drop off wandering sonic wolves in Hollowshade, as does the sonic wolf blood. The molds are apparently given by an NPC, and further details are needed.</li>
<li>Bards mush create the <b>ceramic sleeves</b> using pottery. The ingredients are: ashes of dark ritual, flask of water, vial of owlbear bile, sonic wolf blood, black silt clay, sketch (NPC provided <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=q74&menustr=120070000000">see Bard Guide</a>) for claw or blade. Then fire with a quality firing sheet. The ashes of dark ritual drop off grimling spiritists in Hollowshade Moor. Owlbear bile is dropped off owlbear cubs and grapplers in Hollowshade. The sonic wolf blood can drop off any wandering sonic wolf in Hollowshade Moor. The black silt clay is a waters edge and possibly underwater ground spawn in Hollowshade Moor.</li>
</ul> 
<p>
When you have combined the appropriate claw/hilt and the 5 other items in the Weapons Assembly Kit, you must bring the resulting weapon and your Apprentice cloak (given during your class-specific questing), to the person who gave you the quest (this varies based on class). A more printable recipe, as well as the stats of the sonic wolf bane weapons <a href="../secrets/recipes_luclin.htm">can be found here.</a> You are then promoted to Journeyman status, given a new Journeyman's cloak and instructed to bring your cloak to Ahom Guzhin. Details on the continuation of this quest <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=q72&menustr=120040000000">can be found here</a>.

34 EQTC:Quests:MultiZone:PoTC Xanthe`s Earring of Nature/PoTC Quest <p>
This is an outline of the two versions of the quest for the Protection of the Cabbage spell (NO DROP, level 59, single-target Protection of the Grove spell for druids.) The original version of this quest, which relies very heavily on tradeskills, results in a copy of the spell and a no drop earring. The second version (also linked in below), results in only the spell. The earring reward is:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
<!--item_op:1111..1..1..0-->
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you have completed this quest and are not a druid, fear not! You can hand this earring back to Rebecca Cabbageleaf for:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<!--item_op:1770..1..1..0-->
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>(Yes, druids can do this quest twice, first trading in their Xanthe's Earring of Nature for the Earring of the Solstice, <b>then</b> completing the quest a second time for the Xanthe's Earring of Nature. Remember to trade the Xanthe's earring in before attempting the second quest combine, due to the lore flag)</i>
</p>
<h3>Some basic background:</h3>
<p>
On May 8, 2002, during the massive tradeskill patch, nine Liber Brassica Felix books were introduced throughout the lands, each written in a different language. They outlined various "gifts" from the three druid races, and gave hints as to the proper combination of them. The folks here at EQTC and the druids from the Druid's Grove did <i>much</i> pooling of knowledge to solve this <i>extremely</i> tradeskill-intensive quest. It was the first cross-server quest of it's kind, and once it was completed, the folks at VI stated that there would become an easier path to obtaining the spell. They also stated that the quest would stay in place for those who wished to strive and obtain the extra reward. (The first person to complete the quest it was the lovely Lady Xanthe Ravenwolf on Bertoxxulous, which explains the new name for the earring.) At that time, the reward was the spell, and a lovely little ALL/ALL no drop earring.
</p>
<p>
On June 5, 2002 during another patch, the tenth Liber Brassica Felix book was found, and the old Earring of the Solstice magically changed into Xanthe's Earring of Nature in inventories throughout the lands. While greeted with some excitement, there was also much consternation by the non-druids in the community who suddenly found their all/all earring turn into something druid-only. Fortunately, VI took pity on all the frenzied tradeskillers who had spent the time and money to obtain the rather lovely earring, and announced partway through the day that Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungus Grove would be glad to accept trade-ins on earrings for something more suitable. (She could also be used to recharge earrings that were mistakenly out of charges, apparently by handing in the Xanthe's earring, then returning the Earring of the Solstice to her.)

<i><b>Please note that ALL of the "gifts" (and all the items that go into them) outlined in the links below are tradeable, so you can (and likely should) enlist the aid of grandmaster tradeskillers on your server for the items that are beyond your abilities.</b></i>

</p>
<h4>Second Gift of the Halflings</h4>
<p>
Note that halfings <i>REALLY</i> love their food, and many of the below recipes yield more than one on a success. Given the difficulty of the final combine, this is a good thing, as you will likely lose many to failures, but, for example, don't go overboard when making marmalade, or you'll find that you have no room for the rest of the ingredients. Also the picnic is a large item, so keep room in one of your bigger containers free for it.

229 Weapon Charts from Geoux Geoux, from the Antonia Bayle server, has provided us with several xls files, for those who want an easily-printable chart of the crafted weapons in any given tier, including wield style, stats, etc. He, like us, has noted several inconsistencies and oddities in weapon progression and stats, as mentioned below.
<h4>Charts</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/weaponsmith/tier2.xls">Tier 2 Crafted Weapons</a></li>
<li><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/weaponsmith/tier3.xls">Tier 3 Crafted Weapons</a></li>
<li><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/weaponsmith/tier4.xls">Tier 4 Crafted Weapons</a></li>
<li><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/weaponsmith/tier5.xls">Tier 5 Crafted Weapons</a></li>
<li><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/weaponsmith/tier6.xls">Tier 6 Crafted Weapons</a></li>
<li><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/weaponsmith/tier7.xls">Tier 7 Crafted Weapons</a></li>
<li><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/weaponsmith/tier8.xls">Tier 8 Crafted Weapons</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li> The Fulginate halberd (tier 5) is statistically wrong, compared to other 
    halberds. Expect this to be corrected in a future patch. </li>
  <li>The Adamantine trident (tier 7) also breaks pattern, but not as badly. It 
    should be 34 Str/Wis, not 17.</li>
  <li>The Adamantine scythe is statistically wrong, compared to other scythes. 
    Expect this to be corrected in a future patch.</li>
  <li>The Xegonite katar (tier 7) has no MP. It should have some; it?s what 
    the progression points to. Also, it?s description flags it as both a 
    1H slash and 1H crush. The Claw also flags as both slash and crush.</li>
  <li>The Xegonite ritual dagger has low HP on it. This doesn?t look intentional. 
    (60 instead of 16?)</li>
  <li>The Xegonite rapier?s secondary stats don?t make any sense compared 
    to other crafted rapiers.</li>
  <li>The Xegonite scimitar?s stats are wrong. It should have 42 H/MP, not 
    18 MP</li>
  <li>The Xegonite trident has stats for a xegonite 1H weapon. It should be twice what it is currently.</li>
  <li>The Ferrite battle hammer (tier 8) looks like it should have 55 H/MP, not 
    80 HP/30 MP. However, both ways it adds up to 110 H/MP combines. This may 
    be intentional.</li>
  <li>Both Tier 8 knuckles are leather-based instead of metal-based now. Is this 
    accident or intentional?</li>
  <li>Both Tier 8 katars are piercing instead of slashing now. Is this intended?</li>
  <li>The Ferrite ritual dagger has 80 HP/30 MP. This is probably reversed.</li>
  <li>The Ferrite leafblade and longsword probably have too many H/MP on them. 
    They have 70 HP/50 MP, should have 80 HP/30 MP or 55 H/MP.</li>
  <li>Both Tier 8 voulges are listed as 2H-piercing weapons. They are supposed 
    to be 1H pierce.</li>
  <li>The Ferrite tomahawk should be a str/sta/agi weapon, not a str/int weapon.</li>
  <li>Both Tier 8 scythes actually do more damage than the other 2H weapons. Intentional?</li>
  <li>The Incarnadine ritual dagger has 90 HP/45 MP. This should probably be reversed.</li>
  <li>Comparing the stat bonuses from the Ferrite weapons to the Incarnadine ones 
    makes me wonder if the Ferrite ones will be tuned down in the future. They?re 
    a huge jump from Adamantine, and not very far removed from Incarnadine. If 
    they do get ?nerfed?, it would probably be called for. As a weaponsmith, 
    of course I?d rather see the Incarnadine ones get boosted, but I don?t 
    think that would be very likely.</li>
  <li>In tier 7, they decided to make damage more interesting by varying the dmg/dly 
    ratios on their weapons, so it?s more than just combo 1 for 1-H weapons, 
    combo 2 for 2-H, and combo 3 for tridents. The ratings, however, remain the 
    same for all weapons in the category.</li>
  <li>Also in Tier 7, there appear to be no new weapons for that tier. All other 
    tiers, including tier 8, have new weapons each time. Having a gray background 
    in the Crafting Level box denotes them. It might be because of the fact they 
    got more creative with weapon damage, but there might be a couple new tier 
    7 plans down the road.</li>
  <li>There are a lot of unnecessary weapons that mirror each other now that dual 
    wield weapons have all been changed to one-handed. Examples of this are spears 
    and short spears. Expect a major weapon smith tradeskill patch in the future 
    to revise this. There?s also a good deal of weapon mirroring from when 
    your skills required specific weapon types to use (spears for Dragoon Spin, 
    for example). Now that all weapons will work with all skills, this could be 
    updated in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other notes from Geoux</h4>
<p>I?ve drawn all the information I used from the charts on EQ2411.com, look for future revisions of these tables on EQ2.EQTraders.com. These charts will print out on standard sized paper in landscape format. I hope this helps you, the weaponsmith, in choosing what you need to make!</p>

<p>If you have corrections, suggestions, or have better luck making it nice and readable on paper, by all means let me know! I know there?s some holes in Tier 8, hopefully I can get them patched soon!</p>

496 9thexpansion Chains of Eternity Announced This producer's letter was <a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq2/posts/list.m?topic_id=522020" target="_new">posted in the SOE forums</a> on September 6, 2012.
<blockquote>
  <p> Greetings Norrath! </p>
  <p>The time has come! We are very proud to announce our next expansion, EverQuest 
    II: Chains of Eternity! <br>
    The team is hard at work developing our ninth - yes, our ninth - expansion 
    and implementing the finer details, several of which I will go into here. 
    When the expansion launches, Norrathians will pass into Ethernere, the realm 
    of the afterlife, where all spirits pass after death on their way to their 
    final resting place.<br>
    <br>
    Recently, something has gone horribly wrong in Ethernere and it is bleeding 
    through in the mortal plane. Over the summer months, evidence of ripples between 
    the realms was in evidence as items with ethereal energy appeared upon the 
    dead. As the tears between the realms widen, it will be up to the heroes of 
    Norrath to save the immortal and mortal realms from collapse!<br>
    <br>
    The adventures in this expansion will be great ones! The team is spending 
    a lot of time ensuring that you experience the story, rather than merely read 
    it, so I won?t give it all away in this letter. As for features and 
    details, we?ve got a lot to crow about. We hope players enjoy it as 
    much as we?ve enjoyed weaving it together.<br>
    <br>
    Cross Over to More Content<br>
    In two re-imagined Ethernere overlands inspired by Feerrott and Loping Plains, 
    players will find a region in chaos. The natural ebb and flow of spirits passing 
    through the Ethernere to each spirit?s final resting place is corrupted 
    and on the edge of destruction, threatening every mortal?s life and 
    afterlife. Through the trials of nine new instanced dungeons, players will 
    attempt to mend the end of all things. Prelude content and dungeons give insights 
    into the threat from the other side while telling all new stories - including 
    advancing the story behind the Ages End Prophecy. Players meet new creatures 
    from the beyond and face a whole host of new challenges.<br>
    <br>
    Lots of Quests!<br>
    In this expansion, the signature, or main, storyline quest will be available 
    to everyone no matter how they play the game. Every player tough enough to 
    access the expansion content will have the opportunity to see how the story 
    ends, and raiding guilds will have opportunities to take part in special events 
    that support the story. Even when the main quest line completes, players gain 
    access to benefits as a result of their heroic acts and get rewards for replaying 
    content.<br>
    <br>
    Adventure and Tradeskill Levels Increased to 95<br>
    We are adding three more levels onto the cap which gives us a lot of opportunity 
    to create new spells, recipes, and Prestige Abilities, our next feature...<br>
    <br>
    Prestige Abilities<br>
    Each subclass will get access to new Prestige Abilities. Our engineering and 
    design teams are hard at work creating new abilities that will set a new bar 
    for players and for creating events. The new abilities give players more tools 
    to tinker with in combat, and designers too. <br>
    Tradeskill Prestige Abilities<br>
    We have started implementing Tradeskill Prestige abilities too. These allow 
    our tradeskill classes the ability to become specialists in their chosen craft 
    in a variety of ways. We?re still creating these and excited about the 
    opportunities that will open up for our tradeskillers!<br>
    <br>
    Guild Level to 95<br>
    To provide new benefits, we wanted to increase our Guild Levels . We will 
    speak more to that when we are further along with the implementation.<br>
    <br>
    Organic Adornments<br>
    We have a new adornment type in development! These Organic Adornments, as 
    the name suggests, will gain experience with the player and grow more powerful 
    as a result. There will be many to choose from so players can focus on how 
    they want to increase the power of their characters.<br>
    <br>
    Loot and more loot<br>
    Of course, there are going to be plenty of items in the expansion for players 
    to discover. This is a very strong content expansion with lots to do and find. 
    We heard our players ask for fewer features and more content that builds on 
    the core game so we?re doing just that.<br>
    <br>
    Extra content<br>
    At the same time as we?re focusing on the expansion, we are still offering 
    live content prior to the expansion. We are releasing the first areas of Sleeper?s 
    Tomb in mid-September which we refer to as the ?Prelude.? This 
    advances the world story as players find entry into the tomb. <br>
    <br>
    We have another event that we?re keeping under wraps that releases closer 
    to the expansion and then, of course, there?s ?Chains of Eternity? 
    itself releasing in November. We?re even releasing additional free content 
    at the same time that the expansion launches. Players will discover that avatars 
    are once again making an appearance in Norrath. These avatars are different 
    from those who appeared in the past.<br>
    <br>
    All in the all, the team is driving hard to bring the players awesome content 
    -- time and time again. I?m among a team of perfectionist gamers making 
    a game for gamers. It?s been incredible to see them work tirelessly 
    for excellence and everyone?s entertainment. Hard not to be romantic 
    about gaming...<br>
    <br>
    There?s more to come in the details, of course, but we have been bursting 
    at the seams to tell you what we can...and now we have.<br>
    <br>
    We invite you to come on this crazy ride with us. We really think you?ll 
    love it!</p>

1 about EQ2TC Welcome to EQ2TC! <a href="http://www.wtfcomics.com" target="_new"><!--image:niami.jpg--></a><p>Welcome to EQ2 Traders Corner! For those of you who are just experiencing tradeskills for the first time, this is the proud "offspring" of EQTraders Corner (EQTC), the largest and oldest EQ tradesill sites in the world. Please remember to read the Visitors Corner message board threads before posting in the forums, as there are some rules of the road that guests are asked to follow, not only to keep things focused on tradeskills, but also to cut down on the massive workload involved in maintaining and updating this site.</p>

<h4>Who's Who?</h4>
<p><b>Niami DenMother ("Mum")</b> - founder/creator of EQTC, this wee redheaded halfling lady is prone to spurts of activity followed by long naps in various people's packs. (Don't forget to leave some chocolate in there for her!).  Due to fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis, those naps are a pretty vital part of the creative process!</p>

<p><b>Ngreth Thergn("The House Ogre" or "the hubbyogre")</b> - Mum's RL husband and reason why EQ2TC was born. He did much of the physical web design for the sites, and while his current job doesn't allow him to do much commentary on the forums, he continues to be the person that keeps Mum balanced ...or at least as balanced as a redhead ever is!</p>
<p><b>FTC guidelines require that we disclose to you that Niami DenMother's RL husband is an employee of Daybreak Games.  Nonetheless, the opinions and other posts expressed here are those of the EQtraders staff and not of anyone at Daybreak Games.</b></p>
<h4>Why Did We Do It?</h4>
<p>Originally, given the high cost in time and money of running EQTC, Mum said a flat-out "NO!" when asked about an EQ2 site. However, the House Ogre can be quite convincing when he wishes, so we decided we'd give it a try and hope for the best.  Things have changed a lot since then - on his job front, on Mum's energy front, on how crafting works in the game, etc., but somehow, we keep plugging along. </p>

<p>Bear with me, and please pardon any out-of-date-articles. I do writing spurts in chunks as time and energy allow. In the meantime, browse the How To section of the site, wander the forums, and join me for an exploration of the addiction that is crafting in EQII!</p>
<p>There are times when crafting makes us all a bit crazy, and I'm no exception. <b><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g277">Here's an old, old (2004) page</a></b> of just how crazy it can be!</p>

59 accessories Furniture - Knicknacks and Doodads Various odds and ends have been added to the carpenter line that don't quite fit in any category. Sorry, no white elephants here ... but how about a nest for your baby dragon? 
<p>Note that with the release of GU36, the Rujarkian Firepit below has active flames and the Rujarkian Signal Fire has red-hot embers and a lot of smoke headed for the ceiling of your home (perfect for sending smoke signals to your attic gnomes?)</p>

108 adorn Adornments and You The adornment system that was released with the Echoes of Faydwer expansion is quite a bit for many folks to wrap their brains around at first glance (or even third or fourth glance), so 'Mum has been busy digging out some extra mental wrapping paper! Hopefully we can take this in small enough steps that you'll end up with a nice pretty package when we are done with this mini-lesson, not just some messy snarl of tape, brain, ribbons, and wrapping paper.
<p>Perhaps the best way to start, is to <b><font color=<blue">think of the adornment system as a way of creating semi-permanent buffs for gear.</font></b> In the end, that is basically what it will boil down to, anyway - items that crafters make that can then be placed on specific types and levels of gear.</p>
<p><b><font color=<blue">Every single tradeskill class will have something that they can make with the adornment system</font></b>. Not every class will have even close to the same number/type of adornments, but everyone can make something, eventually.</p>
<p><b><font color=<blue">Adornments are tradeable, and can be applied by anyone</font></b>. All adornments can be traded, and any player can apply them to the appropriate gear.</p>
<p><b><font color=<blue">Every adornment is meant for a specific slot and minimum level of gear.</font></b> Each adornment is used only in one specific gear slot, and can only be placed on a certain minimum level of the gear (NOT the level of the player, but the gear). So, a level 30 ear adornment, could be applied to an earring that was level 30 or higher, but not to a level 29 earring.</p>
<p><b><font color=<blue">Every adornment recipe requires special resources that are created by the transmute process.</font></b> When gear is broken down with transmuting, tier-specific special resources are created that are only used to craft adornments. The resources are tradeable, so you don't have to be a transmuter to make adornments. It is beyond helpful to have a transmuter as part of your crafting alt-army, to break down ingredients for yourself, but contrary to a widely-held misconception, you do not have to be a transmuter to make adornments.</p>
<h3>Adornments and the Crafter</h3>
When able, we will get out a master list of which class makes which adornments. However, the system was receiving tweaks right up until launch, and our lists are hopelessly tangled and incorrect. We're working on it as we get the proper recipe drops distributed to the classes that can use them.
<p>In the meantime, however, let me give you a few examples to help you get this settled in your mind. An alchemist might make some "polish" that can be applied to rings that increases your resistance to something, such as a fiery polish that has a +vs heat boost on it. A jeweler, on the other hand, might make a "clasp" for a neck slot item that increases the effects of all heal spells, while a provisioner makes a "fastening" for a wrist item that grants +STR.  And so on.</p>
<h4>Ingredients and Naming</h4>
If, using the above example of a fiery polish, we were to make the item, it would have a different prefix name, and use different ingredients, based on the tier of the recipe. A flickering fiery polish would be the tier 1 version, for example, while the tier 7 version would be a scintillating fiery polish. The tier 1 version of it would be likely to use ulteran powder and lapis fragments, while the tier 7 version would use illusionary powder and lunar fragments.

Let us just step back from that for a moment. It will make much more sense once we have some confirmed recipes to look at.  Instead, let us take a quick look at this from the customer end.
<h3>Adornments and the End-User</h3>
Everyone and their cousin's cousin will be wanting adornments. Please realize that the supplies won't always be easy to come by, recipes won't always be easy to come by, and your crafter is likely to be as confused, or even more confused than you are, with regards to what can/cannot be made by whom.
<p>Every crafting profession gets <b>different</b> adornment recipes from every other crafting profession, and it is not always easy to tell at a glance which crafter you will need in order to adorn a specific item with what you want. What you want may not even be an option.</p>
<p>Take several deep breaths, let the crafters catch up, and start edumacating yourself now on some of the easier details to sort out. Adornments are tradeable and do NOT require any crafting skill to apply.  To apply the adornment, you right-click on it and select the use option, then mouse over the item that you wish to adorn. If the cursor is outlined in red, that item cannot be adorned for one of <i>several reasons</i>. If it is outlined in blue, you are clear to use the adornment on the item.
<ol><li>Items must be fully repaired before you try to adorn them</li>
<li>Items must be of equal or <b>higher</b> level than the adornment you are trying to put on it. It if says level 30 on the adornment, it can only be placed on an appropriate item that is level 30 or higher.</li>
<li>Adornments are permanent. Once you place the adornment on an item, there is no getting it back. 
<li>Any stat changing effects from an adornment will display on the item in blue text. Any proc will be listed in the proper spell effects section on the item.</li>
<li>One adornment per item. Placing a second adornment on an item deletes the original adornment and replaces it with the new one.</li>
<li>Every adornment is targeted at a specific gear slot - no trying to put an adornment for an ear slot on your bracelet.</li>
<li>Not all gear can be adorned, even if you match up the level and slot correctly. Imbued gear cannot be adorned until after GU32 goes live. Certain quest rewards, such as items in the Claymore quest line, cannot be adorned, etc.  Any item that displays as "ORNATE" cannot be imbued.</li>
</ol>
There will be more written on this subject, however, please realize that the folks that are trying to get this all set out in a coherent format are still trying to wrap <i>their</i> brains around it enough to explain it to others. Please DO post questions/comments to our forums with specific confusions, error corrections, and so on...
<h3>Take Note - Quality Matters!</h3>
One important thing to note is that quality matters ... kind of.  Every adornment recipe will show you a secondary result (byproduct) when you examine it. As well as the adornment itself, you will recieve back one or more of the ingredients used in the recipe, based on the quality level completed. While the amount returned for tier 1 adornments isn't that impressive, every little bit helps, and it really adds up when you're finishing off a tier 7 adornment and getting back a half dozen (wild guess, I don't remember numbers) of the fragments that went into the creation of the item.
<h3>Class-Specific Adornment Guides?</h3>
One of our community members, Lucutious of Najena, with the help of the community, put together adornment charts for his guild's wiki, with information sorted by tradeskill class and by slot.  Rather than try to duplicate his efforts, he's been kind enough to give us a link to the master adornment guide. Check out this wonderful <a href="http://www.deadzed.com/pe/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Adornment" target="_New">Master Adornment Guide</a>.  You can also find a more compacted master chart, without a lot of the extra bells and whistles on the <a href="http://www.britlore.co.uk/eq2/adornments.php" target="_new">Britannic Lore site</a>.

82 ALH Curt Schilling and SoE Help Raise Money for ALS Association <h3>CURT SCHILLING ENTERS A WORLD OF FANTASY DURING RED SOX-YANKEES SERIES JUNE 5, 6, 7</h3>
<h4>World Series MVP Debuts in the Virtual World of EverQuest II As an Evil Villain and Helps to Raise Money for ALS Association</h4>
<!--image:schillingnpc.jpg-->
SAN DIEGO, CA ' May 24, 2006 ' Sony Online Entertainment LLC (SOE), a global leader in the online video games industry, today announced that Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling is about to debut in his favorite online video game, EverQuest II, as an epically awesome, loot-dropping virtual bad guy who battles unwary players.  And it's all for a good cause.
<p>Schilling's video game character will reside within the online world of EverQuest II (EQII) for three days during the Yankees vs. Red Sox baseball series June 5, 6 and 7, 2006 at Yankee Stadium.  During this time, anyone can register for and log into EverQuest II at www.battleals.com to challenge the evil Schilling character, appropriately named 'Curt Schilling.'  
</p><p>
Every time a player defeats the virtual Schilling character, Sony Online Entertainment, creators of EverQuest II, will make a donation of $5 dollars (up to a maximum of $10,000) to the ALS Association, which assists patients with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.  After the three-day baseball series, Curt's character will remain within the game as a high-powered enemy that characters will have to face later in the game.  At the launch of the campaign on June 5th, Schilling's 10-year-old son, Gehrig (named after the legendary Yankee first baseman), will be one of the first to battle his virtual dad in-game.
</p><p>
In addition, SOE will encourage its hundreds of thousands of EQII players to type /ALS within the game in order to donate money to Curt's charity of choice, the ALS Association.  This program will run for the entire three-day series and will give the SOE player community a chance to help with this worthy cause.
</p><p>
"ALS is about as devastating a disease as you can imagine," says Schilling. "It's relentless, ruthless, and devastates entire families as one member slowly perishes.  With video games exploding in popularity, I can't think of a better place to reach the masses to raise awareness.'
</p><p>
ALS is no stranger to baseball; it's more commonly known as Lou Gehrig disease, named after the New York Yankees infielder whose Hall of Fame career was cut short by the degenerative nerve disease.  Lou Gehrig played in 2,130 consecutive games before ALS stopped him, a feat matched only by Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr.  Curt Schilling and wife Shonda have been involved in the fight against ALS for more than a decade.  Shonda serves on the board of directors of ALS Association's (ALSA) Greater Philadelphia and Arizona Chapters and advocates for ALS patients with members of Congress.
</p><p> 
Schilling may be one of today's top athletes in professional baseball, but off the field he spends time playing with his son in the award-winning Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) video game EverQuest II -- a fully realized 3D fantasy world of mythical creatures, magic spells, majestic landscapes, and fierce dragons -- since the game's creation.
</p><p>
EverQuest II offers players a huge online world where thousands of players come together for shared adventure and community.  This online game sets the standard for graphical realism, as players are immersed in the game's exciting locales and dangerous lands. EverQuest II has a powerful epic storyline and gives players the potential to be hero or villain in a world that never ends. 
</p><p>
'I enjoy the anonymity and the ability to interact on a personal level with people I wouldn't normally meet or know,' Schilling said. 'That, and the game is a riot. There's no end to it, the world is enormous, the possibilities are endless, and above all else, it's a place to go and relax amongst friends. What I can't get enough of is your ability to interact with real live people. The game's about teamwork, and knowing the right way to pick and play your class properly in such a way that it complements a group. That's why EverQuest has stayed so popular.'
</p><p>
The 39-year-old baseball superstar has been a long time fan of SOE games, even contributing game reviews of expansion packs to gaming magazines, and is an avid web communicator, feeling this is the best way to connect with the video game fans.

104 altars Furniture - Altars The Echoes of Faydwer expansion introduced several new quest series regarding the return of the gods. These quests allow players to help the gods regain power in the lands, make sacrifices at that deity's altar in return for favor that can be used to call down miracles and the like, and so on. 
<p>While a deity revamp is still in the works, another good-only gooddess, Erollisi Marr, was added in 2015 to the list of those who could be worshipped.</p>
<p>On top of the altars being quest rewards within the deity progression, there are carpenter-made versions of the altars.  The common (tier 4) altars look the same as the basic altar rewarded in each deity quest line, and the rare (tier 7) "imbued" altars looks the same as the advanced altars that are given out later in each quest series. (The crafted altars reduce your purchase cost for blessings and miracles in comparison to the quested altars - see chart below the images for details.)</p>
<p>All crafted altars are no value. There is no status rent reduction tied to these house items. In addition, <b>altars cannot be placed in guild halls</b>, due to how the worship system is handled.  However, there is a "shrine" version of these altars that is purely decorative, for use in guild halls and homes alike. These decorative shrines</p>
<p>No trade recipe books for the altars are sold on special Deity Historian NPCs at the BBM docks and in front of the Kelethin Library.</p>
<p>Common altars (level 35 recipes) use: <b>9 severed briarwood, 2 feyiron clusters, 1 etched leather pelt, 8 garnet sandpaper</b>.  The rare ("imbued") altars (level 65 recipes) use: <b>1 rough lumbered ebony, 14 rough lumbered rosewood, 3 adamantine clusters, 2 horned leather pelts, 20 acrylia sandpaper</b>.</p>

<p>In each of the below images, the common altar is on the left, the rare version is on the right.</p>

<h3>So, I Have an Altar - Now What?</h3>
Deities reward their faithful worshippers with various blessings and miracles, each of which has a specific favor cost assigned to it. This favor is earned by performing specific quests for your deity, as well as sacrificing various items of value at an altar dedicated to that deity.  Crafted altars reduce the favor cost of such blessings and miracles, in comparison to their quested counterparts.
<p>
This list also include the Blessed altar, a dropped altar that has the same graphic as the crafted rare imbued altar, and the Ordained altar. (The Ordained altar is a fabled no-trade drop from Mayong Mistmoore - thanks, Faush, for the added details!).</p>
Numbers used in the below are comparing the first available blessing and miracle. Blessings and miracles vary in cost based on which one you select, but the percentage discount should stay the same for any specific altar type.

<h3>Shrines</h3>
As mentioned above, the way worship at altars is handled made it so that altars are not allowed to be placed in guild halls.  An additional carpenter-only recipe book (Decorative Deity Shrines) was added to the Deity Historian NPCs containing recipes for purely decorative shrines that can be placed in the guildhall.  Decorative means that they cannot be used for worship, but you can place them for looks.  In addition, each of these shrines have extra particle effects that you do not see with the common or imbued version, making them even more impressive decorations than their more humble counterparts.
<p>The recipes are level 65, and require 3 rough lumbered rosewood, 2 adamantine cluster, 1 horned leather pelt and 10 acrylia sandpaper.  The finished shrines have 100 rent status reduction when placed in a home.</p>

<p>The fall/winter/spring EQ2 event overload, coupled with expansion time, tends to cause more burnout for me every year. When the inevitable happened in 2016, I ended up wandering over to DC Universe Online for a bit to unwind. Of <b>course</b>, once I created a few alts, I couldn't long resist the lure of writing in yet another world and I've been doing so in chunks ever since!</p>
<p>It all started innocently enough, of course -- I joined a league (guild) that had a character bios section in their forums. One bio became two, two became three, and they were a bit more involved than what the leadership had been expecting. The next thing I knew, there was a story subforum set up, and my alts started clamoring to have more of their tales told. While I am no longer with that league, the Muse has zero desire to be quieted, so this section was born.</p>
<p>This section is in-progress, and likely will be for quite a while. Stories are still being written, and additions will come at unpredictable times. (On top of yet more medical mayhem, the expansion/event chaos season in EQ2 is once again ramping up for several months of swamped redhead, so the Muse may not get as much of a romp as I'd like.)</p>
<p>Now that this section has been added to my site, additional updates and additions to these tales will include a publishing date, so you can readily tell when something has been added.</p>

<ul><li><b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g598&menustr=128200000000">GypsyLynx</a></b> - star traveling alien felinoid, nature healer and not-so-grumpy redhead.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g606&menustr=128200000000">Volt Sisters</a></b> - a large and still growing multi-part saga of identical twins who ended up on extremely different paths. You'll find that GypsyLynx also figures prominently in at least the first several installments of this ongoing storyline.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g602&menustr=128200000000">Pink Spinel</a></b> - currently this only contains a biography for this bookish crystalline sorceress, but a story is percolating in my head. Only the Muse knows when it will consent to being more solidly recorded!</li>
<li>Blue Halfpint- this is a placeholder for now. Never fear, though, there are several chapters waiting for that final spark that pushes them from rumbling around in my head to being recorded here.</li>
<li>RockLobstr - yep, another placeholder. It may turn out to be just a brief biography of this humorous themed persona that ended up with a distinct personality of her own, or it may end up with a story or stories. Time will tell!</li>

<a name="downtime"></a><h3>Volt Sisters #1: So Much for Downtime</h3>
<p>You would think with all the parks and such in Gotham and Metropolis, that GypsyLynx would be able to find a calm patch of greenery to rest and mentally recharge. As a nature healer, she <i>needed</i> that sort of downtime for her own sake, but didn't want to stray too far from the cities and the inevitable emergencies that required her skills. The parks that she'd found, however, tended to be teeming with heroes, villains, Ivy's plants, Brainiac's minions, Circe's beasts, Queen Zazzala's drones, and so on, and so on.</p>

<p>Thus, she took to the rooftops, and the various roof gardens that were scattered hither and yon. Sadly, today seemed to be one of those days where even those were not a peaceful haven, and she finally settled in a lovely little roof garden in Chinatown that only had one occupant.</p>

<p>Of course that lone occupant was a teenage heroine who appeared to have been crying recently. Better a crying teenager than a raging adult, however - their problems usually were a bit easier to handle, and didn't leave her worrying as much about her own safety.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the girl appeared to have functional flight wings, Gypsy set down carefully on the small roof, making sure she was just a bit out of arm's reach. She was less worried about the girl lashing out than the she was worried that her arrival might spur the girl into doing something suicidal that even her wings couldn't pull her out of.</p>

<p>With a mental sigh, Gypsy did something that she hated doing, and tried her best to resemble a Terran feline basking in the sun. Various people had called the pose "catsprawl" or "flatcat", and she knew she looked ridiculous as she lay sprawled, eyes closed, on the roof ... but that was sort of the idea. While she loved basking in the sun, she really disliked people thinking of her as some overgrown cat. (She swore she would do something rude to the next person who offered her catnip!)</p>

<p>Sure enough, the quiet sniffles from the girl soon turned into watery giggles. Gypsy swiveled one ear towards the sound, and cracked an eye open. Her voice was mellow and dreamy-sounding as she spoke. "I may not be related to the cats you have here on Earth, but I have to admit they have the right idea about basking in a lovely sunpuddle to unwind. It feels divine on these old bones."</p>

<p>Now, which of those tempting conversational lures would the young one go for? The fact that she was hinting that she wasn't from Earth? The fact that she called her bones old, when she appeared to be in her 20s or so? Neither? Both?</p>

<p>The inelegant snort that came as a response proved that typical teenager response won out over mere curiousity. "Right. you're not THAT much older than me."</p>

<p>Gypsy slowly turned her head to the side, still sprawled. A light breeze had sprung up and she took a moment to try to blow a long strand of red hair out of her face before she gave it up as a lost cause and answered. "Actually, my people were very long-lived, and, as a healer, I also know how to reverse and delay some of my own aging processes. I'm ... hrm ... about 537 or so, when I convert it over to Earth years."</p>

<p>"Were? What happened to your peop- Whoa! 537?! No way!"</p>

<p>Gypsy shifted until she was sitting cross-legged on the roof, still careful to give the girl some space. "Brainiac happened to them. And yes, 537-ish. Years get kind of fuzzy when you spend so much time traveling from planet to planet, as many of them have some very varied methods of measuring time, and some vastly different planetary rotation schedules compared to my world ... or yours." She leaned back, bracing her arms behind her and turning her face to the sun. There, she'd broken the ice while still keeping it mellow and low-pressure. The teen would either keep the conversation going or not, as it suited her, but at least she no longer looked on the point of tears.</p>

<p>"Brainiac is quite the home-wrecker, isn't he?" The girl's voice was bitter as she ran a hand through her short, spiky white hair.</p>

<p>"Homes, families, cities, entire worlds and the races contained on them. It can be pretty hard to wrap your brain around it, especially since it is hard to "get" something with that different a mindset from your own. I used to really hate him, but hate can only propel you so far before it twists you all out of recognition. Now, I just want to stop him from causing yet more harm and destruction."</p>

<p>She could see the girl biting back on several heated comments, and guessed that hatred still seethed in the teen. To difuse and divert, she added. "Folks call me GypsyLynx, by the way."</p>

<p>Good manners, or at least good habits, had the teen responding. "They call me DarkVolt." She bit her lip, then burst out, "And Brainiac split my twin and I up. I HATE him!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry about you and your twin. Do you want to talk about it? These ears will hear as much or as little as you want them to hear." Gypsy swiveled her ears around, making a silly face at the same time.</p>

<p>This drew an unwilling-sounding giggle from DarkVolt before the teen stared down at her hands and the small arc of electricity now forming between them. She stared as if mesmerized, then drew a deep breath.</p>

<p><i>Good going, Mree. Now she's either going to shout at you or zap you. Either way, you can kiss your afternoon downtime goodbye.</i> Mentally talking to herself was a bad habit that Gypsy had picked up during the centuries she had spent planet-hopping. However, that was better than doing the same thing out loud -- at least, it was if she didn't want to be locked up in an asylum! She'd heard about how these humans housed those they believed to be insane, and she had ZERO intention of getting anywhere near such a place, thankyouverymuch!</p>

<p>DarkVolt's shoulders sagged and the electricity dissipated. If Gypsy's ears had not been as good as they were, she'd have had to strain to hear the low-voiced comments. "My twin is a villain now." She looked up, torn between defiance and fear, as if expecting the worst, and her voice got louder. "There, I said it. She's a villain! And we're twins! We're supposed to be the same! That's what identical twins ARE! So everyone's acting as if it is all my fault! They're expecting me to crack and go evil too!"</p>

<p>Gypsy blinked, then calmly replied, "Well, that's certainly silly of them."</p>

<p>Clearly, that was a new reaction to her news, and one that the girl clearly didn't didn't know how to handle. "But, they- ... I ..."</p>

<p>"You'll find that "they" have just as many wrongly-held beliefs as right ones. So will you, especially if you listen to them. So, indulge an old lady and tell me what happened. After, I'll explain why I think their expectactions are silly, deal?"</p>

<table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:humor/dark_troller.jpg--></td></tr></table>

<a name="troubled"></a><h3>Volt Sisters #2: Troubled Teens</h3>
<p>"Kyra and I are identical twins. Or, well, we were identical." DarkVolt bit her lip. "Um, I'm Kyla Volt, by the way. Anyway, we used to do everything together, and folks couldn't tell us apart. But then things started changing. She started wanting to hang out with a rougher crowd, and we started arguing a lot -- we never used to do that. Kyra said I needed to lighten up and stop being so squeaky clean."</p>

<p>"Then one day she was caught breaking into someone's locker at school, and got detention for a week. The only problem is, that she claimed to be me when they caught her, so it was my name on the detention slip." Kyla took several deep breaths before she continued, her dark eyes bleak as she stared down at her fisted hands.</p>

<p>"We had a horrible fight as she drove us home from school that night. I accused her of getting me detention so she could go hang out with her new friends without me hanging around trying to keep her out of trouble. She accused me of turning into a boring snob that didn't know how to enjoy life anymore. The longer we argued, the more wild our accusations became."</p>

<p> She swallowed heavily, before continuing. "We were both so distracted with our argument that we didn't notice we were in the middle of a HIVE infestation until it was too late. They were stealing exobytes, security guards, heroes and villains were trading fire with them, and it was a huge mess. The next thing I know, the car was hit with ... something." She hesitated a moment, then took several tries to get the next part out. "They - ... They say I was flung from the car during the crash, while Kyra was left trapped inside."</p>

<p>"The exobyte canisters that hit us in all the chaos may have saved our lives, but they also split us apart. We both ended up with electrical abilities, but, as Kyra says, I got the 'pretty goodie two shoe wings', while she ended up becoming a "part-metal maiden" from the explosion debris that ended up merging with her body."</p>

<p>Kyla's tone momentarily took on the flat inflections that Gypsy often heard in the highly traumatized. "She said that now that we looked so different, maybe folks would stop pushing her to be so much like me, and took off. I hear she's hanging out with greed demons and the like now."</p>

<p>"I HATE these powers! I don't want to be some wimpy healer! And I know Kyra and I could have worked things out if we'd had more time! I wish --" She broke off, and hunched over, breaking into heart-breaking sobs.</p>

<p>Gypsy slid over to sit beside her, and simply held her while she cried. Sometimes the hardest part about being a healer was knowing when to simply let a caring touch start your work for you.</p>

<table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:humor/snarkvolt_dps.jpg--></td></tr></table>

<a name="stray"></a><h3>Volt Sisters #3: Taking In a Stray</h3>
<p>As she held the sobbing teen, some instinct caused Gypsy to activate her healing gifts. After over five centuries at healing other races, she was adept at running some rather in-depth medical scans, and she'd heard rumors of a few less-than-stable exobyte transformations. </p>

<p>Her insticts were unfortunately accurate once again. Kyla's control of electricity was weak and erratic, and she would never be a powerful meta powered hero. Perhaps the exobyte suffered some damage in the explosion that blew open the canister before hitting the teen. Perhaps it was Kyla's own unwillingness to become an electricity-based hero. Or ... perhaps it tried to change both twins at the same time, and they each got a partial transformation? An interesting theory for another time, and one she couldn't investigate further unless she had a chance to also examine Kyra, or "Snark Volt" as she was calling herself, as if to taunt her "DarkVolt" sister.</p>

<p>It was a shame that after the upheaval that acted as the death blow to the sisters' relationship, they ended up stunted powers on top of it all. Then again, with the Kyla's teenage scorn regarding being a "wimpy healer", maybe it was for the best?</p>

<p>But what would she do instead? Gypsy would have to think on various options she could suggest, while she got to know Kyla better. Call her a meddler if you like, but her nurturing nature was not going to let her sit by and not help this girl.</p>

<p>As if on cue, Kyla slowly started getting her crying under control, and Gypsy felt a slight stiffening of the girl's shoulders. Correctly interpreting the signal, Gypsy dropped her comforting arms, and slid away just a little. Humans, especially hormonal teenaged ones, tended to be a bit uptight about personal space and comforting touches.</p>

<p>She went back to soaking up the soothing sunshine while she waited for Kyla to speak.</p>

<p>When Gypsy had arrived on the roof, most of her attention had been focused on the troubled teen sitting in a miserable huddle. Now, she took an extra glance around the rooftop so as to give Kyla a bit more time to pull herself together without feeling like she was being stared at. She tilted her head a bit to stare at an overstuffed backpack sitting next to a bench, then turned her head to look at Kyla with a raised eyebrow as the girl cleared her throat.</p>

<p>"I- IwaskickedoutofmyhouseandnowIhavenowheretostay." Kyla's face was a mixture of defiance, shame and pleading desperation.</p>

<p>"Kicked out?! Some humans do NOT deserve to have anything to do with the rearing of children." Gypsy snarled, then calmed her tone a bit. "Tell me what happened, while I try to figure out some safe options for you." She was 99 percent certain that Kyla was a "good kid" through and through, but she needed to make sure before she put any plans to find the girl shelter and help in motion.</p>

<p>"After Kyra and I changed, and Kyra took off to be with her new 'friends', Dad packed up and left. Just packed his stuff, and walked out the door, leaving me alone with Mom. Mom-" She gulped, then forged on. "Most of the time Mom blames me for Kyra's leaving, for Kyra's change, for Dad's leaving, for the accident ... even for Brainiac, some times. When she isn't blaming me for everything wrong, she's pretending that nothing is wrong. Kyra is just 'going through a rebellious phase' and will be back 'any day now." Or worse, she thinks <i>I</i> am Kyra, and badmouths 'Kyla' for leaving."</p>

<p>Kyla clenched her fists, then continued in a small voice, shame making her shoulders and her wings droop dispiritedly. "I finally couldn't take it anymore, and shouted at her I never knew from moment to moment how she was going to react to me. That this wasn't my fault, and that I need her help. She- she told me I was a horrible child, a horrible sister, a horrid daughter and lots of other stuff. She even accused me of making up the detention story just to shift the blame. Then she kicked me out. She told me not to bother coming back unless I had Kyra and Dad with me."</p>

<p>"She's right. I should have just accepted my detention quietly, and not argued with Kyra. Then we'd all be one happy family still. It IS all my fault!"</p>

<p>Gypsy's voice was gentle, but firm. "Hey, no more of that. It is NOT your fault, and I repeat what I said earlier. Some humans should NOT have anything to do with the rearing of children. Period."</p>

<p>Kyla looked as if she was about to defend her parents, but Gypsy continued talking, catching and holding the girl's eyes. "When horrible things happen, folks can act a bit strangely and not all can cope well with them. Kids tend to be pretty resilient, thankfully, since, when adults fail to cope, it is the kids that suffer the most. Your dad simply refused to deal and walked away. Your mom, well, she checked out mentally - most likely she feels powerless, and as you're the only one she had left, she decided it was easier to blame you than anyone else. Again, NOT your fault!"</p>

<p>"Now, do you have any other relatives in the area?" A mute headshake to Gypsy's question was the only response, as Kyla struggled to keep from crying again.</p>

<p>"Mom's not the only one feeling powerless! Everything is just so out-of-control!" Kyla grabbed hold of her head and shook it, hands clenching in her spiky white hair.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Gypsy's exclamation caused her to look up in confusion.</p>

<p>The mentions of "power" and "control" had sparked a thought in Gypsy's mind, and she held up a finger, asking for a moment while she chased the stray thought down.</p>

<p>Power, control ... Lanterns! It must have been close to 50 years ago, on some planet whose name she now forgot, when she had healed a very badly wounded member of the Lantern Corps. She had refused payment, and he had insisted that the Green Lantern Corps owed her a debt. This wasn't quite what he had in mind with that promise, however, so all she would do is make the Lanterns aware of the girl, so they could see if she would suit as a recruit.</p>

<p>"I <i>may</i> have a long-term solution for some of your problems, but I need to check in with some folks first. In the meantime, there's no sense trying to involve Social Services or the like." (There was no disguising the flinch that Kyla gave at the mention of that organization.) "They're overloaded with too much right now due to all the chaos, and as a metahuman, they're likely to try to pawn you off on another group. Some of those groups are less than reputable, and I don't want you scooped up by Lexcorp for their metahuman study." Gypsy couldn't control her shudder as she mentioned Lexcorp. Some of the stories she heard about his experiments made all her fur want to stand on end, and she wasn't easily frightened!</p>

<p>"For the short term, my place is not only bigger than I need, but I'm also rarely there. You're welcome to crash there for now. I can also check in with the authorities, so they know where to find you in case either of your parents comes to their senses, but I'll make it clear that you're welcome to stay with me for the time being. I've built up enough renown around the city that they won't quibble with me taking a minor under my wing. Speaking of which, how old are you, anyway?" She paused, finally letting the girl get a word in edgewise again.</p>

<p>Kyla flushed. "Sixteen. Technically able to file as an emancipated teen in Metropolis, but I have to prove I can support myself. I wanted to go look for a job, but without a place to stay, and an adult guardian ..." she trailed off, biting her lip. It was clear that her pride had her wanting to pass up the "charity" of a place to stay, but that she'd had enough time on her own, and enough intelligence, to not quibble when she knew that she desperately needed a helping hand.</p>

<p>"Don't go fretting the job quite yet. Let me check and see if my idea pans out, and that you suit them and they suit you." Gypsy grinned, but wouldn't explain that cryptic statement any further as she led Kyla back to her Metropolis lair.</p>

<a name="loose"></a><h3>Volt Sisters #4: Loose Ends</h3>
<p>Kyla made a bit of a face at the brightly-colored Playhouse bed when Gypsy showed her where she could sleep.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Kyla, I know it may seem a bit loud, but it was a cheap spare bed. And I nap-tested it myself after I bought it to make sure it was at least comfortable. It definitely beats sleeping out in the streets or on a mattress on the floor of some crowded shelter."</p>

<p>Kyla flushed, then rushed on. "I know. Please don't think I'm not grateful for what you're doing ..."</p>

<p>"S'ok. I sort of flinched and squinted my eyes the first time I saw it, too. I keep meaning to redecorate, but there have been too many other distractions and priorities." She tilted her head a bit as she saw Kyla biting back a question. "I don't mind questions, you know. I don't bite ... much." She grinned teasingly and swiveled her ears for effect.</p>

<p>"I get the idea that you're really busy, which makes me wonder why you chose that rooftop ..." the teen said hesitantly.</p>

<p>"Well, originally I'd been searching for somewhere green to take a bit of a breather and that rooftop was the best I could find at the time." Gypsy answered truthfully. Best to start as she intended to go on, and make sure that Kyla knew she could expect truth from her instead of comforting platitudes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I rui-"</p>

<p>Gypsy waved her hand and spoke reassuringly. "Easy, Kyla. Let me finish. I may have arrived there because of that, but I'm. Hrm, how would you say it on this planet? Oh, yes, I'm "wired" to help folks. My people believed that a true healer is one who heals hearts as well as bodies, and I've carried that belief with me everywhere I go. Before you think it is all one-sided, it helped me, too. I haven't made many friends here, yet, and you feel like you could become one."</p>

<p>Kyla flushed at the praise, then blurted out. "Thanks. It is just that, well, that rooftop garden was pretty formal and fussy, and you seem that you'd like something more wild." She belatedly clapped her hand over her mouth. "That came out sort of wrong, I mean something less fussy, not implying something based on the catlike look."</p>

<p>A purring sort of chuckle came from Gypsy's throat. "I know. You don't have the sort of vibes coming off you that some humans do, thinking I am little better than a wild animal. It happens, and they're not really worth my time. Anyway, back to the subject at hand, it was the closest I could find to nature without either being in the middle of a war zone, or heading out into the country. I never know when I'll be needed, so I try to stay within either Gotham or Metropolis for speedier response time."</p>

<p>Kyla's face brightened at the thought of being able to do something for the lady who was helping her so much. "Have you ever been to the north end of the hydroelectric dam here in Metropolis?"</p>

<p>"I have passed by the front of it before," Gypsy said with a slight frown. "But I don't remember seeing much greenery."</p>

<p>"Behind and to the sides, there are some steep hills leading down to the water. There are trees and bushes and such left to grow however they want, without all that formality they have in Chinatown." Kyla offered excitedly. "I think it would be perfect for you! Folks tend  avoid it due to how rugged it is. That's where I slept last night, though I kept worrying that I was going to slide down the hill and into the water."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Kyla. I really appreciate it. I'll be sure to check it out. I really need my nature recharge times, and they're getting harder to find these days. Hopefully heroes and villains alike will continue to leave that area alone. It is one thing for them to break the mass transit systems. It would be another to interrupt the power that all factions in this ongoing battle need in their everyday lives."</p>

<p>Sensing that the teen could use some quiet time to herself, she left Kyla to get settled in at her place and headed into Midtown Metropolis. She wasn't going to get any more downtime with her brain now spinning with ideas, so she might as well not only check out the area that Kyla had mentioned, but also to start tying up a few loose ends.</p>

<p>Business before pleasure, of course, Gypsy thought as she entered the Midtown Metropolis Police Department. A quick query as she entered referred her to a "Mister Conlon" who was serving double-duty manning a desk, as well as selling gear to random heroes.</p>

<p>"I'm selling ..." the fresh-faced man in a suit began. She could tell from his tone and the look on his face that he had said his spiel far too many times, and was heartily tired of it.</p>

<p>"Pardon the interruption, but I'm not buying. They told me I should speak with you to file a report on a homeless teen that I found."</p>

<p>"They're a dime a dozen these days with everything going on. Give her this pamphlet on local youth shelters, and hope that she not only follows through but that they have room for her." He pushed a pamphlet across the desk to her, then started to turn away, clearly dismissing her from his mind.</p>

<p>She slid the pamphlet back towards him. "Thank you, but it is a bit more complex than that. I'll try to be brief, since your time is valuable, and I can then provide further details if needed." Gypsy hurriedly added, forcing the man to turn back to her. "She's a 16-year-old heroine, thanks to the accident that happened when she and her twin were transformed. The twin's gone villain, the dad's walked out, the mom's mentally checked out, pinned all the blame on her, and kicked her out of the house. I can and will give her a home at my place until something better can be arranged."</p>

<p>"That's good of you, but the shelt-" he began with a frown, only to be interrupted.</p>

<p>"Sir, we both know the shelters and Social Services are overloaded. They're also not well-suited to handling depressed teenaged metas. There's a real danger that she would fall through the cracks, or that Lex Luthor would get his hands on her by bribery or deceit. We do NOT need him experimenting on any more metas, much less a vulnerable teenage girl. Add in that the twin is tangled up with greed demons, and keeping a decent but impressionable teen out of harm's way is a Really Good Thing."</p>

<p>Those last two points thawed the petty bureacrat's demeanor quite a bit. "Good points. So, if you're going to take her under your wing, erm, paw, erm ..."</p>

<p>Gypsy waved off his fumbling for words. Now was not the time to get her fur ruffled if she wanted to have this fellow helping, rather than hindering her efforts. "I'd rather not get charged with kidnapping. I'd like to leave my contact info, and her name with you, just on the unlikely chance that one of her parent's comes back to their senses and tries to pull her back into that toxic household. Having Metropolis's finest solidly on my side if that happens, so they can be stalled until she can file for emancipated minor status could be the saving of this girl." There. Often the local police resented the heroes and villains tromping all over their jurisdictions, so the fact that she was coming to them and politely asking for their assistance might soothe a few ruffled feathers and make it easier to get the assistance she needed.</p>

<p>"Gotcha. Let me take down the information and start the word spreading through the other precincts right away! And, um, sorry about the paw-thing, ma'am."</p>

~~~

<p>Gypsy then headed to the other end of the station, where she'd heard that the Green Lanterns were recruiting. Once there, her cat-pupiled green eyes widened in surprise as she saw a familiar face. "Drisch! I was going to stop in to see if they could pass a message to you, and here you are!"</p>

<p>"That's Recruiter Dri-" the Green Lantern paused in mid-word. "Well, Mreeannallyrr Prrrtan, as I live and breathe. Have you been hiding yourself in stasis for the last few decades? You don't look like you've aged a single day since you saved my life out in sector 2816! What brings you to this embattled planet?"</p>

<p>Gypsy blinked rapidly to counter the sudden sting in her eyes. After the destruction of her world by Brainiac, there were few beings in the universe that had ever bothered to learn her full name, and fewer still that remembered it. It had been many, many long years since she had heard it uttered by a friend.</p>

<p>Thus, it was with the greatest respect and appreciation that she responded, "My apologies for the informality while you're on duty, Recruiter Drisch." She gave him a smile and a respectful nod of her head. Chivying hotheaded humans into wielding the power of Will was likely not an easy task, and those standing near him needed to know that he was deserving of her every respect. "The promotion suits you, I must say. As to what brought me here, I arrived here rather by accident, but I have stayed due to Brainiac. And, I, um, stopped by to cash in on that favor."</p>

<p>"If it is within my power and doesn't conflict with my duties, I will be happy to aid you in any way possible, my lady. I owe you my life, after all." he returned gravely, and ushered her into a currently unoccupied office where they could speak more privately.</p>

<p>Once the door was closed behind them, Gypsy got down to the purpose of her visit, "I've found a talented teenager in need, and I think she would make a good Lantern."</p>

<p>"I can make no promises. We have selection criteria, and many hopefuls lack the proper Will to finish their recruit phase. We also tend to want them to have reached adulthood first, as this is a difficult path to walk." He tilted his head and clopped his protruding tusklike teeth together. "But you know all that, and you never struck me as being the sort to make frivolous or unreasonable requests. Another of your hunches?"</p>

<p>Her own laugh was rueful as she spread her furred hands wide, careful to keep her clawlike nails retracted. "Yes, another of my infamous hunches. I'm not asking for preferential treatment for her, just that someone meet with her and see if she would suit your needs as well as I think she would -- and that you folks would suit her needs as well." Quickly, she outlined what Kyla had been through and what she viewed as some of the girl's main strengths and weaknesses. </p>

<p>Drish listened attentively, then responded, "Considering that, if not for one of your hunches, two Lanterns would have died that day instead of just one, I would be honored to at least meet this young human. I trust your hunches and your judgment."</p>

<p>Gypsy's eyes brightened at his response, but she replied gravely, "I am most appreciative. Since you are so busy here, and I do not wish to get her hopes up unduly after what she has been through recently, how about if I make dinner for us at my place after you are done your shift tomorrow? I remember enough of your dietary preferences that I can put together a meal suitable for our three races. Until and unless you decide to recruit her, all she will know is that an old friend of mine is visiting for dinner."</p>

<p>Drisch bowed. "I fear I will end up deeper in debt to you, as I remember quite fondly your cha'veth stew."</p>

<p>Gypsy laughed. "I may have to get creative on the ingredients on such short notice, but I'm good at improvising in the kitchen!"</p>

~~~~

<p>Kyla was the only one of them that was surprised when, after dinner the next night, Drisch not only invited her to become a Green Lantern recruit but also offered to personally mentor her.</p>

<p>Gypsy merely grinned and winked, "It was all because of the cha'veth stew, right?"</p>

<a name="twins"></a><h3>Volt Sisters #5: Twins</h3>
<p>"I guess you want your space back after all." Kyla stared down at the dishes they were cleaning up now that Drisch had left. While her face was partly hidden by her pose, her entire posture spoke of her conflicted feelings.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I'm enjoying having you here," came the immediate reply. As the teen looked up with a "Yeah, right" sort of look, Gypsy continued, "No, really. You're well mannered and amazingly housebroken for a human teenager. You're pretty good about cleaning up after yourself. You give me someone to chat with, instead of me just talking to the potted plants all the time, too!" She injected a note of teasing into her voice as Kyla's face continued to wear a troubled frown. "So, what's really bothering you?"</p>

<p>After several long seconds, as Kyla debated on several responses, she blurted out, "You're not just giving me a place to stay so you can make sure I don't turn out like my sister?"</p>

<p>Gypsy flicked a couple soap suds from the sink at Kyla. "Pffft! If I thought there was true danger of that, I'd not have let you into my home. I'd not have invited my old Lantern friend over. And he most definitely would not have recruited you for the Green Lanterns." She then decided that full honesty was the best way to go. "Yes, I asked him over here as a favor to me to see if you'd make a good Lantern. But that's all. He knew, and I knew, that if you didn't suit, that was all there was to it. He'd not have recruited you if you weren't what they were looking for. I did this not for me, to get rid of you, but for you, in hopes that it would give you a few more options regarding your life. To give you a feeling that you had something under your control instead of feeling you had to be a healer due to what the exobytes dropped on you. Options are good, options are a happy thing. Besides, I'd rather you <b>not</b> leave here for a while."</p>

<p>Kyla's face was a study in confusion and surprise at that last comment. "Why not?"</p>

<p>"As mentioned before, I like your company. Also, it isn't safe for you to live on your own until you've got a bit more legal status protecting you. Even then, I'd rather you were somewhere safe until you were a bit more settled with the Lanterns or we can help you find a safe place to call your own. Lex Luthor is using some very shady means to grab metahumans to supposedly study their powers, and, I've heard some truly Bad Things about what happens to them. And, well, your sister's so-called friends may also try to use you to keep her in line. It won't hurt for them to know you're being watched by myself and the Lanterns, and thus aren't as vulnerable and as tempting a target. I may be a healer, but I am also a grumpy old redhead, and they'll think twice about messing with me." Gypsy grinned, showing off a mouthful of very pointed teeth.</p>

<p>Kyla's face seemed to crumple in on itself at the mention of her sister, so Gypsy shooed her to a chair at the table. "Sit. The dishes can wait. It is time for the promised talk about twins, in hopes that maybe you'll be able to let go of some of that guilt and worry that I know you're still lugging around."</p>

<p>"Forget everything you've been told by "them" regarding identical twins. It doesn't matter if "they" were parents, other relatives, friends, teachers, what have you. Just forget it all and please listen for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"All that being an identical twin means is that you start out sharing the same looks and genetics. Yes, when you were very young, you likely had very similar personalities, due to your closeness and how you shared pretty much everything. Eventually, however, differences in your personalities should have started to appear, even if you still did pretty much everything together."</p>

<p>"But why ...?" Kyla burst in.</p>

<p>"I'm getting to it. It usually starts with little things. A simplistic example would be a breeze on a hot summer day. One of you gets cooled by the breeze and feels refreshed, creating a positive link in your mind between good things and breezes. The other has the breeze blow dust into her eyes, making her even more hot and irritable. So she doesn't think so well of breezes. Something that basic and simple can change your mood and outlook a tiny bit. Even such tiny little things add up over time. And think of any time you were separated for whatever reason - maybe one got sick before the other or one of you ran errands with one parent while the other was with the other. Each of you had different experiences, and even if you told each other all about it afterwards, it wasn't <i>quite</i>the same as truly experiencing it firsthand."</p>

<p>"Very tiny, little things, like grains of sand, start building you into unique and distinct individuals. As time went on, I bet you started liking or disliking different things, as well, based on all those tiny little individual changes."</p>

<p>Kyla bit her lip and nodded slightly, "She- She used to hate doing household chores. Since Mom always assumed that if she saw one of us doing the chores, we both were, I usually did them so we'd not get into trouble." Her tone turned bitter, "Mom and Dad were big on punishing both of us when one of us got into trouble, too."</p>

<p>"I'm guessing that, as you got older, Kyra kept acting up more and more as rebellion for your Mom trying to force you to be perfect clones of each other, and you kept trying to keep the peace while covering up for her."</p> 

<p>The teen blushed, which was all the confirmation that Gypsy needed.</p>

<p>"So, you have two teens that have started growing in very different ways. And there is nothing wrong with that. Even your sister's acts of rebellion weren't anything horrible or unforgivable, I am betting, or you'd not love her as you do. But, you're human teenagers, and that makes for quite the emotional roller coaster due to all the chemical changes your body and brain are going through thanks to hormones. At the best of times that makes for some rocky moments, even between twins. But you didn't have the best of times. You already had a sister that was coming to resent you because of the expectations of others. She wanted to be an individual instead of just someone's twin. It was easier to blame you, than to blame everyone who lumped you two together as a single unit. Just like it was easier for your Mom to blame you for the split in the family, rather than taking a closer look and realizing that, as a parent, she had to take responsibility too."</p>

<p>"Then the accident happened, and you both changed, and it all came to a head before you two could properly talk it out. While your sister still worries about you, she allowed herself to be lured by the words of greed demons. She wanted to be valued, and they convinced her that she was deserving of taking anything and everything that she wanted to take. A part of her regrets that choice, but the other part of her revels in it."</p>

<p>"I didn't tell you all that about her!" Kyla exclaimed, confused.</p>

<p>Now it was Gypsy's turn to bite her lip. "Well, I sort of ran into her today on my way back here from shopping for ingredients for dinner and we talked --sort of. I hadn't told you sooner because we got immediately busy on dinner, and I didn't want you upset when our guest arrived. So, now, I'll tell you all about it."</p>

507 depots Depot Deliberations <table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:misc/depot_banner.jpg--></td></tr></table>

<p>Mum was a harvesting addict, and proud of it! Of course, this sometimes meant that she made the guild harvestables depot creak and groan as she tried to cram in more different types of resources than it wanted to handle, or more of a specific item than it wanted to hold.  Add in her pack pony, and her new gathering goblin, plus those of guildmates, and sometimes things in the depot got ... cozy."</p>
<p>She <i>really</i> needed to empty her bags, though, and didn't fancy selling a bunch of odds and ends of resources, so off she went to the guildhall.  "Mayhaps if I jump up an' down on top o' th' depot, I can cram a bit more rhenium in? It nae ... what?"</p>
<p>She stopped dead at the entry to the guild's crafting room, staring at the crowd of about a dozen people, most of them strangers, standing around the harvestables depot.  Before she could ask what was going on, the familiar voice of her guildleader piped up, "There she is! Let's try it!"</p>
<p>A large troll in workman's clothes scooped her up and carried her towards the open depot.</p>
<p>"Now jus' wait a dadburned minute. Let me go! Unhand me! Ard, tell him to let me go NOW!" She kicked, she screamed, she bit. She threw a full-fledged redheaded hissy fit, or as much of one as she could while some strange troll was trying to stuff her, willy-nilly, into a large wooden depot.</p>
<p>There she was, about to get a faceful of loam and other resources, and ... the depot spit her out with a loud "SPOOT"</p>
<p>"Well, ptooey tae ye as well!  As frae th' rest o' ye, someone best start explaining, afore I warm up th' RPoD!"  She blew an errant strand of red hair from her face and glared at guildmates and workmen alike."</p>
<p>All eyes turned to a distracted-looking gnome, who was scratching his head in bemusement.  "I don't understand. I expanded the number of units per resource type. I increased the number of unique resources it could hold. I fixed it so it would hold all crafting resources, instead of just most of them. She's most definitely a valuable crafting resource, and should fit in.  Even though she's larger than your average resource, the increased storage space should have been able to handle even someone of her girth."</p>
<p>Niami just stood there, openmouthed, trying to work her way through what had just been said.  Meanwhile, everyone but the speaker had taken several steps away from the pair, if they hadn't fled outright.  Even her guildleader was edging his way towards one of the teleport pads.</p>
<p>Her attention turned back to the gnome who had tinkered with the depot. "Sae, th' depot holds more now?"</p>
<p>"Five times as much, yes. I thought that would be enough to-"</p>
<p>"While I'm flattered that ye consider me a 'valuable crafting resource', I'm in nae way, shape or form thrilled aboot being scooped up with nae e'en a-by-your leave, much less th' snarky comments aboot me girth, ye little pipsqueak. Th' fact that ye improved th' depot <b><i>almost</i></b> makes up frae it, but nae quite.  It means I'll consider healing ye -- after I beat the lot o' ye soundly!  Aye, th' whole lot o' ye!  I do nae expect th' gnome tae use common sense aboot grabbing someone an' stuffing them in th' depot, but the rest o' ye should hae known it was a bad idea!  An' as frae ye," she whirled to confront the guilty-looking guildleader. "NAE COOKIES FRAE YE!"</p>



<hr></hr>

<p>Sound the gongs, bang the drums, on December 18, 2012, the guild harvestables depot is being improved! The maximum number of different resources that you can store in a Guild Harvest Depot is increased from 200 to 1000. The maximum number of items in a single depot stack is increased from 20,000 to 99,999.  In addition, various resources that never fit into the depot before, including ingredient drops from Emerald Halls and the Nest of the Great Egg, will finally fit in it.</p>

<p>And that's not all!  Seven new guild depot amenities are being added!</p>

<table align="center"><tr>
<td align="center">Ammo Depot<br>(holds 100 different)<br><!--image:misc/ammo.jpg--></td>
<td align="center">Collectible Depot<br>(holds 5000 different)<br><!--image:misc/collectible.jpg--></td>
<td align="center">Food & Drink Depot<br>(holds 200 different)<br><!--image:misc/food.jpg--></td>

<td align="center">Fuel depot<br>(holds 100 different)<br><!--image:misc/fuel.jpg--></td>
<td align="center">Lore & Legend Depot<br>(holds 500 different)<br><!--image:misc/lore.jpg--></td>
<td align="center">Potion, Poison & Totem Depot<br>(holds 200 different)<br><!--image:misc/potion.jpg--></td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center">White Adornment Depot<br>(holds 500 different)<br><!--image:misc/adorn.jpg--></td>
</tr></table>


<p>In all cases, the purchase price each of these new depot amenities is 25 plat and 5,000,000 status.  The upkeep for each is  50 gold and 25,000 status.  (These are the same costs as the Harvestables Depot.)</p>
<p>Each of these new depots, as well as the Harvestable depot, will have a "Deposit All" button that will find everything in your packs that will fit into the depot in question, and dumps it all in.  This may be good if you have stacks and stacks of resources that you want going into a depot, or a few thousand arrows to make available to your guild, but you might want to triple check before you hit that button to be sure that you aren't about to deposit your own personal rares, or the contents of your own quiver and such into the depot as well.  Some of the depots might have some extra filters, instead of just "all", so you can deposit only the common resources, and the like.</p?
<p>At least for the time being, the access for these depots will go off guildhall access levels, not guild ranks, so you'll want to think carefully about how you have access for your guildhall set up, and who you want able to withdraw from the different containers. Anyone can <i>deposit</i> to the depots, and you will be able to set <i>withdraw</i> access to each individual depot to Trustee, Friend or Visitor.  Clearly, if your hall is set to allow visitors, you likely won't want every stranger off the street able to raid your depots, but you may want to check what guild ranks have which level of hall access (Friend or Trustee) before you set (from the amenities page) the depots to Friend or Trustee-only.</p>
<p>The other thing to note is that the harvestables depot improvements are <b>only</b> for the guildhall version, not the personal harvest depot.  They know that we want improvements there, and that we'd love things like the fuel depot for home use as well, but those are on the "we'll consider it later" list.  First, they need to see how these new depots work out for guilds, what sort of load it puts on the database, and so on.</p> XXX 2012-12-18 01:55:28 2012-12-17 10:07:52 Niami Denmother 0 0 2012-12-18 01:50:05 Niami Denmother
15 desks Furniture - Tired of Your Desk Job? While there aren't a large variety of desks, there are at least a few styles to choose from, including something suitable for the short folk. (The bizarre fir desk is VERY short, coming up to a halfling's knees or thereabouts, and is likely better as a bedside table).  
<p>
If you're interested in other desk-type objects, make sure to see the Tables page, as several of the bone tables, also make suitable desks.<p>

137 dfcfashion Fashion - Deathfist Citadel Armor Sets Spring 2007 saw the revamping of the Deathfist Citadel (DFC) zone. Along with that revamp came the release of some new class-specific armor sets that require recipe and resource drops from Zek and DFC. (Both recipes and ore are chest-only drops.) Sets are split between 3 pieces from a common dropped recipe book, and 3 pieces from a dropped rare recipe book.

134 domino EQ2TC Interview with Domino <p>As many of you know, Emily \"Domino\" Taylor took over as our new tradeskill 
  developer recently. Since I am sure many crafters are interested in knowing 
  more about her, she was kind enough to answer a few questions for EQ2TC.</p>
<hr>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Niami: Domino, thanks again for taking the time out to answer a few 
  questions for us, now that you\'ve settled in a bit! </p>
<p>We know from the <a href=\"http://eq2players.station.sony.com/news_archive.vm?id=1156&section=News&locale=en_US\" target=\"_new\">the 
  SOE mini-interview</a>, that you\'ve been crafting in EQ2 since beta. Are there 
  any other MMOs in which you\'ve crafted in the past, and if so, which ones?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Domino:</strong> I played EQLive for several years, but I never got 
    greatly involved in crafting, it just didn?t interest me. I think I 
    got one character up to about 300 in cooking, but that was the highest. I 
    used to spend quite a lot of time farming crafting components for other people, 
    but I didn?t have the patience to do it for myself.</p>
  <p>I tried out SWG briefly when it was fairly new (pre-Jedi unlocking) and played 
    around with a couple characters on a friend?s account. The crafting 
    there seemed very interesting, and I liked what I saw of it, but it was too 
    complex for me to really get involved in when I was just playing around on 
    a friend?s alt. The actual gameplay itself didn?t catch my interest 
    at all, so I didn?t end up getting my own account and sticking around 
    though. </p>
  <p>EQ2 is the only MMO I?ve played so far where the gameplay on the adventure 
    side was interesting enough for me to stick around long enough to get caught 
    up in the crafting, and the crafting was interesting enough to keep me doing 
    it once I started.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Niami:. Do you do any real-life crafts, and if so, what ones?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Domino:</strong> I like to cook, I also crochet, and I used to enjoy 
    pottery though I haven?t done that for a few years. I took a course 
    in making silver jewelry a couple years back and made a couple of rings and 
    things, but I haven?t kept that up. </p>
  <p>Actually, I just moved into a new apartment this week, so currently real 
    life and EQ2 are overlapping in a slightly surreal manner. I spend my evenings 
    looking around at furniture and furnishing my apartment, and I spend my workdays 
    looking around at furniture in Norrath too. I swear I?ve started expecting 
    to see rough linen rugs in Ikea. This weekend I got two baby cacti to decorate 
    my desk, but since I have a black thumb, the jury?s still out on whether 
    they?re going to live. It?s just as well gardening isn?t 
    a tradeskill in EQ2!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Niami: Do you want to admit to an in-game personal favorite tradeskill?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Domino: Carpentry was my first character to 70, so I?d have to say 
    that one. I have various other crafters, but I find something very satisfying 
    about being able to put what I made in my house and see it physically there. 
    That?s definitely a psychological advantage carpentry has over the others. 
    I have or had crafters of most types scattered around at various levels though, 
    and enjoy them all in their own way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Niami: I see from the SOE housing forum that you\'re collecting information 
  on furniture issues, to see if the Art folks can give them some needed loving. 
  Are we going to see some overdue TLC on those issues?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Domino: </strong>I can?t promise anything there, since I can?t 
    make those changes myself. I also know with the new expansion coming up, the 
    art department is flat out on more urgent things, so I don?t plan to 
    pester them about furniture bugs until things calm down a bit. At this point 
    I?m just compiling the information, so I can put a request in the (probably 
    very long) queue when it seems more appropriate. But, I hope eventually it 
    will be possible to address them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Niami: I suspect that this following question is asked of devs too 
  rarely. What can we, as a community, do to help you? Are there certain issues 
  you want us to report on, or specific forums or threads you want us to watch 
  for feedback?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Domino:</strong> I can?t speak for any other devs, but personally, 
    I don?t plan to be shy asking for opinions in the tradeskill forum if 
    I?m interested in getting some. Just don?t assume that simply 
    because I?m asking about something, that means it?s going to happen 
    tomorrow! I like to get a feel for the big picture before prioritizing things, 
    so some things I ask about today may be filed away for future reference way 
    in the future. </p>
  <p>It also helps if folks can keep threads on topic, and be detailed in their 
    responses; saying things like ?make tradeskills worthwhile,? or 
    ?the crafting process needs to be more fun,? while heartfelt, 
    really doesn?t help me to identify the issues that you feel need changing. 
    A concise list of exactly WHAT would make tradeskills worthwhile to you, or 
    suggestions about what would make the process fun, maybe even with any appropriate 
    screenshots or mock-ups to demonstrate your ideas, helps a lot in understanding 
    exactly what?s being requested. </p>
  <p>And finally, if you notice something is bugged, do submit a /bug report in 
    game. This sends it to QA so they can verify the bug, and once they?ve 
    done that they?ll pass it on to me with all the details of what files 
    and file names are involved. This saves me a lot of time since I don?t 
    have to go hunting around trying to find the files myself. While it may seem 
    more immediate to post bugs on the forums, it does bypass the QA testing and 
    ends up taking me more time to fix (it?s also more possible I?ll 
    accidentally forget about it, if it doesn?t sit in my bug queue).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Niami: For these next two, I want to remind the community that 
  even the best-laid plans and intentions change between concept and implementation. 
  In no way are these to be considered set in stone promises. Anyone found holding 
  these up to the devs with a \"You said ...\" in the future will be solidly 
  and thoroughly gnawed and/or solidly ker-thwapped with the RPoD by a feisty 
  halfling! ;)</p>
<p>What do crafters have to look forward to in the next update 
  or so with regards to bug fixes and/or new content?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Domino:</strong> I?m going to start trying to pad out the recipe 
    books of some of the classes who?ve traditionally had the fewest recipes. 
    I know that number of recipes isn?t everything, but it?s a good 
    place to start! However, I?m still learning where everything is and 
    how it all works, and I?m already starting work on the next expansion, 
    so until the expansion is out of the way, back-filling recipes is going to 
    be a part-time ongoing process that will likely end up being just a recipe 
    here and there slipped in when I have a few spare minutes. Woodworkers should 
    already have seen they have a couple of RP musical instruments heading their 
    way (with big thanks to dev Feconix).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Niami: Is there anything you can tell us about some of the long term 
  stuff you\'re hoping to tackle? I\'m sure your plate is beyond overflowing right 
  now, so it may be hard to target which are the \"hottest\" at the moment.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Domino:</strong> I?m hoping to make a post with some more details 
    on this very soon. I?m all for crafter world domination of course, but 
    apparently this requires a bit more negotiation than I?d expected. ;) 
    I don?t suppose I could borrow that RPoD for a couple of days ??</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Niami: Since I\'ve a reputation to maintain, will we be seeing the return 
  of any chocolate recipes at any time in the future?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Domino: </strong>Absolutely, this is very high on my list! I also 
    hope to introduce more roleplay type food such as birthday cakes and wedding 
    cakes, and of course, bring back cheesecakes for the ratongas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Niami: Following what now seems to be an EQ2 tradition, cake or pie?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Domino:</strong> Are you suggesting I have to choose just one? That 
    does not compute ? <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <strong>Niami:</strong> A woman after my own heart! Thanks again for taking 
  the time to answer these for us, Domino! I\'ll leave everyone with my own answer 
  to the cake or pie question, in the form of a little bit of lighthearted haiku 
  ...</p>
<blockquote>
  Cake or Pie, ask you?<br>
  The filling matters little.<br>
  Chocolate rules all.</p>

<p>Crafters who complete the Thurgadin crafting questlines, and do enough daily faction questing with the Forgemasters of Thurgadin will gain the ability to purchase heirloom recipe books for all crafting classes.  While the details of this process will be contained in another article, I wanted to get started by mentioning the furniture yummies from carpenters right off the bat.</p>
<p>Here is what you can expect to find as new carpenter furniture recipes.  All of them, other than the guild tapestries, require only common tier 9 resources. (The tapestries require a crystalline spiderling silk from the expansion crafting quest content, which will be covered in more detail later.)</p>

As with all other parts of the expansion preview, information was gathered during the beta testing phase, and last-minute changes are always a possibility.  Note that this expansion contains content for level 85+ crafters.</b></p>
<h3>General Expansion Information</h3>
Destiny of Velious, the EverQuest 2 expansion that will launch on February 22, is aimed at level 86+ adventurers and level 85+ crafters.  Access to the new area for those who own the expansion will be via an othmir on the Sinking Sands Docks.  (Note: If you haven't already been through the prequel quest to learn a bit of the lore, and to collect your Lodizal plushie, you may want to go work on <a href="http://eq2.zam.com/wiki/eq2_quest%3AThe_Beginning_of_the_End" target="_new">"The Beginning of the End"</a> before the quest is disabled, since we expect it will end on launch day.)
<p>And now, on to the crafting details ...</p>
<h3>Pristine Bonus Changes</h3>
As already mentioned in the SOE forums, the pristine bonus xp for first-time item creation is going away, and crafting quest and tradeskill writ xp will be increased.  Since there is already a spirited discussion regarding the change going on, I'm going to refer you over there, so you get the news directly from the source.  (See <b><a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq2/posts/list.m?topic_id=495103" target="_new">this thread in the SOE forums</a></b>). 
<p>My own <i>personal</i> recommendations with regards to these changes are as follows:
<ul><li>If you are below level 85 and want to experience the new content, get any unearned pristine bonuses in now, but hold off on any questing and writs that you've not yet done until after the expansion launches on Tuesday. This will maximize your xp. The downside is that you won't be able to tackle the new content crafting quests until you're 85, but you'll get the most leveling out of your efforts</li>
<li>If you are 85-89, again, snag what pristine bonuses you feel attatched to, then take a breather - you'll want to be full vitality and raring to go when the expansion hits with the huge number of new crafting quests!</li>
<li>If you are already level 90 - make sure you've got your T9 resources handy, any portable kits you want as timesavers, and you can hit the ground running</li></ul>

<h3>Stat Changes</h3>
We're getting <i>almost</i> used to things changing with regards to stats and how they affect various classes, which is a good thing, because, yep, there are changes again this expansion.  For a really detailed look at it, hit up your favorite adventuring site/forum and ask around there, but here's the Mum translation:
<p>HP and power won't be on gear.  Instead, HP will be based on your STA stat, regardless of class.  Power will be taken from whatever your adventuring class' primary stat is: STR for all fighters, AGI for all scouts, WIS for priests, INT for casters.  That is it.  No more AGI for avoidance, no more WIS for resists, no more INT for priest-class critical mitigation, etc.</p>
<h4>What Does This Mean for Crafters?</h4>
You may find resist jewelry is a bit more popular. You will also find folks may be a bit more fussy about stat lineups on gear. Other than that, the biggest impact will likely be for provisioners.
<p>Expect dual-stat food and drink, where one of those stats is <b>not</b> STA to drop a bit in popularity.  (There will likely be no reason anymore for someone to want INT/WIS food or drink, for example.)  Food and drink with single stats, or a primary stat plus STA, are likely to be more popular. If you are fuzzy as to the stats on the crafted food and drink, you might want to check out the <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g55&menustr=040000000000">You Are What You Eat</a> page here on the site and the food and drink charts by tier.</p>

<h3>How Many Recipes Do I Have?!</h3>
One little thing that suddenly appeared when I was using the default UI on the last few days of beta was a recipes count at the bottom when I opened up my recipe book.  The count on the copy I was using at the time was over 3000! If this feature stays in, you'll be able to see at a glance, without hitting the eq2players site, just how big your recipe collection really is.

<h3>A Word About Maps and UIs</h3>
Every single crafting quest that I saw in the new expansion (and I'm pretty sure I saw all there were ... several times), was tied into the map POI system. This meant there was a pretty aqua dot or highlighted area with for my quest target(s). This is a godsend for those of us who get easily lost. Note, however, that I was testing with the default map UI. If you use eq2maps and/or a custom UI for your mapping, you may or may not see these helpful little highlights on launch day.  Remember to check for available UI mods and such while you're waiting for the game to come up on Tuesday!  :D

<h3>Velious Harvests</h3>
As mentioned back at Fan Faire time, there will be some specialized Velious harvests with some limited uses.  Because the uses are very limited, and the area is so cold and bleak, do not expect the same amount of node density that you see elsewhere, or anything close to that number of nodes.  There aren't that many nodes.  Compulsive harvesters brace for that now.  Really. You don't need stacks of 200 of everything right off the bat.  Truly.  Repeat to yourself several zillion times between now and Tuesday so you don't go into harvesting withdrawal on that first day.
<p>That having been said, here is what you can expect:
<ul><li>Iceclad Cutlassfish: fishing nodes around Fina's Retreat, which is the area where you first arrive in Velious. These are used in small numbers for a few crafting quests. There are also some off the coast of the ringwar area, around 70, -544, 118</li>
<li>Dens - Brontotherium meat, manticore mane, molkor hide. Dens are found around Fina's Retreat, the Snowfang Gnoll camp, the peaks around the Goahmari village and near the old battlefield. The brontotherium meat is the common, the other two rare. The meat is used in several crafting quests, as well as some provisioner faction recipes. The other two are only needed for a single quest, if my memory serves me correctly.</li>
<li>Chillbloom gathering nodes - So far, found only in the snowy peaks above the Goahmari village, it is used only in some provisioner faction recipes, I believe.</li>
<li>Mining nodes - so far, found only in the <i>rocky</i> peaks around and above the Goahmari village, there are three stone types that can come from them. These are only used for faction recipes that commission craft items for adventurers using their instance drops.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Charmed, I'm Sure!</h3>
Level 90 dropped, crafted and quested charm slot items from the Velious expansion will be able to accept crafted ethereal adornments.  I seem to have lost my list of which adorns will work, other than the INT, WIS, STR, AGI ethereal adornments (I know there were a few others, but I can't find the notes right now - I'm sure someone will give me a memory clue sooner or later!)

<h3>Crafting Quests</h3>
There is so much crafting quest love that I'm going to do up a separate article about them. The short version in the meantime is several robust quest series, with some lovely house item rewards, a flying griffon mount quest for crafters, the first-ever tradeskill heritage quest for the Coldain Prayer Shawl, ... andddddd an appearance by the most-loathed crafting quest NPC of all time - Qho.  Once you get done with the initial screaming and gnashing of teeth at having to deal with that little brat again, you're going to love his reward!
<p>Below is a tiny bit of crafting quest eye-candy to whet your appetite a bit while I get busy writing over the next day or two.</p>

<h3>Crafting Recipes</h3>
On top of several crafting recipes from quests that you will be able to keep, every primary crafting class has class-specific recipes.  High-end tinkerers also have a small quest series, and get to keep one recipe that not only makes a house item, but is required for the Coldain Prayer Shawl quest.  (There are no new adorning recipes.)  Since there is a lot of ground to cover on the recipe front, that, too, will be covered in a separate article or two.

<h3>Far Seas Goodies</h3>
The Far Seas Supply Division faction vendor in Mara will be offering a three new fashionable crafting outfits to go with those already available ...

<h3>Red Glowie Love!</h3>
On top of a new red glowie collection in Thurgadin, there's some extra special love for those folks who have earned their <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q27&menustr=060020000000">Earring of the Solstice</a>. With the expansion, red glowies will be visible to those who have earned the earring, without the need for the earring to be worn.  Now maybe I'll stop forgetting to swap back to my healing earring when instancing with my guild!

<h3>Other Things to Think of Before Launch</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, there are a lot of new crafting quests, and there is a lot of running around to go with them. Crafters who are also level 30+ adventurers might want to have some totems of escape on them - even on classes that can also evac. Trust me, if you really get into the groove, you'll find a use for them faster than the cooldown timers!</p>
<p>Make sure your bags are stocked with T9 common resources and certain T9 fuels. (Ethereal coal, ethereal sandpaper, ethereal filament, ethereal kindling and aerated mineral water come to mind - no need for incense.) The fuels will also be accessible on various vendors, mind you, but sometimes you'll find yourself a goodly ways from a vendor when you need it, so planning ahead will save you some time.</p>
<p>Portable crafting stations come in handy in a few instances, to save you a little bit of running around the large zone.  They're not necessary, just time-savers. Forge, sewing table and woodworking table come to mind off the top of my head.</p>
<p>Pack extra sanity.  {sage nod}  You and everyone else are going to be full of questions, comments, links of newly-found stuff, etc. Every channel is likely to be scrolling like mad.  Personally, no insult meant to my guildmates, I may do like last launch day and not only turn off all channels, but turn off guildchat until I've gotten a chance to get settled in. Otherwise, I won't be able to move a step due to answering a flood of questions.  :D  </p>

<H3>What Next?</h3>
Stay tuned to the <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g446&menustr=115000000000">Destiny of Velious expansion preview</a> main article for more details as time and energy allow!

<p>Niami DenMother was up to her eyeballs in alligators when she heard rumors of the newly-rediscovered land -- and the alligators were fighting back!  She was also trying to deal with a lovelorn ogress, who had just suffered another Erollisi Day rejection. Much as she wished to go check for new crafting techniques and products, she just didn't see how she was going to fit everything into her already-busy days. Unless ...</p>
<p>Cautiously, she backed away from the medicated Ykeshan alligator, blue eyes alert in case of trouble.  "All right, Ngranna-lass. That be th' last o' them. Hopefully that will help them fight off whate'er's been ailing them.  I'm still nae sure why th' trolls couldnae do this themselves, but at least it be done now."</p>
<p>Ngranna clambered off the back of the groggy gator with none of her usual bounce. Even her green mohawk was drooping, and tears were once again leaving large streaks down her muddy green face.  "Dey jus' wanna see 'Granna all muddy, to laugh at her.  Everybuddy laugh at secksi ogress," she said sullenly.</p>
<p>Yep, definitely time to give Ngranna a project to distract her. The last time she got this distressed, everyone in the neighborhood had resorted to earplugs for a week, due to her extremely loud wailing and moaning.</p>
<p>Thinking about all that wailing, Niami spoke quickly, trying to forestall another round.  "Now that I'm done helping ye, lass, I'm wondering if ye could help me a bit.  It seems we've found a way back tae Velious after all this time, an' I'd like th' crafting checked out."</p>
<p>Ngranna nodded, lower jaw jutting out as she mumbled, "Sure, Mum. Not like 'Granna has hot date now."</p>
<p>"Och, lass. Think o' all th' new folks ye could meet while there. I'm sure, being cut off like they have, they've ne'er seen th' likes o' ye. Ye're a skilled jeweler, an' a fine figure o' an' ogress!" Mum coaxed, appealing to the large woman's wounded vanity.</p>
<p>Ngranna perked up a bit, lifting a meaty green hand to primp at her drooping hair.  "Dat true!  'Granna go clean up, den will head out.  Will send back report soon!"  With that, she stomped off through the swamp, making a big enough splash as she did so to thoroughly coat Mum in mud and swamp goo.</p>
<p>"Och!"</p>
<p>~~~~</p>
<p>A couple days later, just as Mum was getting worried that she'd heard nothing from Ngranna, a package arrived containing a battered travel journal. </p>
<p>Quickly, she flipped through it, a frown growing on her face as she read. As usual, Ngranna's habit of hiding her true self was strong, and she loosened her "dumb ogre act" only a little when she wrote ... at least for the first several entries.</p>
<blockquote>Giant turtle too old and stringy to make good stew. Fish have possibilities.</blockquote>
<blockquote>'Granna no want food that talks back, so left otter-men alone. Had nice crab stew snack, though.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Preserved parsnips ok, but 'Granna wonders about candied gnoll ears.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Would dwarves get mad if 'Granna snacked on spy-bird?  Goat-man got angry about wooly spiderling crunchies, so 'Granna not want to risk it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Brontotherium steaks! Dat hit the spot!</blockquote>

<p>"Och!  I should ha'e packed her a picnic basket afore she left. She's thinking wi' her stomach again!"  Mum shook her head ruefully as she tucked a loose strand of red hair back into her braid and continued reading.</p>
<p>Suddenly, her eyes widened as she read the next, clearly-written entry.</p>
<blockquote>I found a group of gnomish pirates on the docks of Thurgadin, and amongst them, one who called himself a gnome, but was as large as I was. Oh, his green muscles, how they ripple as he works. Such a thoughtful frown on his face as he concentrates on his "inventions."  I yearn to learn more of this mysterious Oomba, and think I may stay here a while, making myself useful. (See enclosed picture, Mum - isn't he a cutie?)</blockquote>
<table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:dov/oomba.jpg--></td></tr></table>

<p>"Gnomish pirate?  Um, riiiiiggggght.  An' distracting enow that she forgets tae act dumb?  An' what about th' non-food crafting?  Either she's been taken wi' snow-sickness, or she's in love ... again."</p>
<p>With a heavy sigh, Mum started mentally rearranging her schedule so that she could travel out to Velious for herself.  Once again, she was reminded that, if she wanted something done right, she had to do it herself.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Next week marks the release of the first Velious expansion for EQ2, Destiny of Velious, on January 22.</p>
<p>The non-disclosure agreement was finally lifted - for most stuff, and I can finally talk about all the crafting goodness coming our way.  Unfortunately, the "most stuff" doesn't yet include the crafting eye-candy that everyone eagerly awaits, and I am waiting for image approval before I put any screenshots up.  (<b>(Edit: approval was received after this article was published - thanks Amnerys and whomever else made this happen!)</b></p>
<p>In the meantime, consider this a placeholder -- I will be dropping in <i>lots</i> of preview information here as time permits over the next couple of days.  There's a huge amount to cover, and I am still trying to get it organized into something semi-coherent.  As I get things ready to read, I'll drop links in here at the bottom of the page, so you don't have to go hunting for it all.</p>

<li>16 Feb, 8:30 p.m.: As has happened with every single preview I've ever written for the site, I forgot something in the DoV General Crafting writeup. I've added a quick paragraph near the bottom of it, regarding red glowies. (New collection, and no longer needing to equip the solstice earring, only own it.)</li>
<li>17 Feb, 2:30 a.m.: Fixed the General link above.</li>
<li>17 Feb, 12:05 p.m.: Added in <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g449&menustr=115000000000">DoV Recipe Book Rundown</a></b> which includes a bit of eye-candy!</li>

<li>18 Feb, 12:08 a.m.: My brain is leaking out my ears, and the "brief" <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q103&menustr=115000000000">DoV Crafting Quest Overview</a></b> is the biggest DoV article yet.

<li>21 Feb, 1:32 p.m.: One grumpy, achy, redhead, reporting for more writing duty. Tackling the rest of the Iceclad quests, then seeing how far I can get on the rest.</li>
<li>22 Feb, sometime after midnight: editing was delayed due to a 6+ hour site crash, but the Iceclad quest series is now all documented. Depending on sleep, downtime and stuff like that, I may or may not get to documenting the Thurgadin quests, the crafter flying mount quests, and the Coldain prayer shawl quest in the morning. I'm pretty well done for.  :(  </li>
<li>22 Feb,~1 a.m.: Since I forgot to include the image anywhere else, the Thurgadin red glowie reward thumbnail went directly onto the <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q41&menustr=060000000000">Red Glowie page</a></b></li>
<li>22 Feb, 10:00 a.m,: I was typing like a madwoman while listening to the live launch webcast this morning, and I have a goodly chunk of the <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q106&menustr=060000000000">Thurgadin Crafting Quests</a></b> written up.  I need a stretch break, but will be back at the edting shortly if the servers aren't ready yet.  (There was some technical issue that delayed launch a bit, at last check, there wasn't an ETA, but they hope it will be "soon")</li>
<li>22 Feb, 10:12 a.m.: While I am thinking of it, SOE is doing a special 12 Days of Velious promotion.

<li>22 Feb, 1 p.m.: While SOE is beating yet another issue into submission, I'm beating more documentation into submission! The <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q107&menustr=060000000000">Crafter Flying Mount Quest</a></b> is now up!</li>

46 sagerecipe Recipes - Sage Sages, a level 20+ sub-class of Scholar, work with arcane knowledge, such as that involved in creating priest and mage skill scrolls.
<hr> XXX 2004-12-07 05:22:26 2004-12-07 05:22:26 Niami Denmother 0 0
116 scholarintro The Essential Scholar The Scholar class is one of three profession choices when you hail a crafting trainer in order to receive your crafting level 10 certification. You should choose this class if you are interested in becoming an Alchemist, Jeweler or Sage. If you choose this class, you will be a Scholar through level 19, at which point you will have to pick one of the three sub-classes (Alchemist, Jeweler, Sage).

<h3>The Basics</h3>
This is the profession that works with all the skill upgrades (app IVs and adepts) for all adventuring professions. The scholar also makes tier 2 jewelry as well as tier 2 potions and poisons. If none of these options interest you, then you should <b>not</b> be choosing Scholar as your level 10 crafting choice!

<p>If, however, you enjoy making spell after spell after spell, concocting potions and poisons, or making jewelry, this is the profession for you.

<h4>Equipment</h4>
You will be using the scribing desk for your spell scrolls. The chemistry table is where you will make app IV essences for tanks, as well as potions and poisons.  The work bench will be used for app IV runes for scouts, as well as all jewelry.

<h4>Items Made</h4>
Skill upgrades (spell scrolls, scout runes, fighter essences), skill upgrades, and yet more skill upgrades!  That will make up the vast majority of your scholar recipes, as well as some jewelry (rings, earrings, scarf, belt, plus a couple secondary/ranged items), and a limited number of potions and poisons, including the first potion of health (heal in a bottle!).

<h4>Item Progression</h4>
This is a good time, if you are considering a future as a jeweler or an alchemist, to become aware of the concept of "item progression".  What this means, essentially, is that not all crafted item types are available in all tiers, but as you progress through the tiers, more item types will be added to your recipe repertoire.  A good example for jewelry is that you don't get items for the wrist slot until tier 3. Additional jewelry items, such as tomes for secondary/ranged slots, metal necklaces, resist jewelry, etc. are also added in higher tiers.  For alchemy, the heal potion is added from tier 2 onwards. Additional stat potions and varying poisons, are also added in later tiers.  (See the potion and poison guide linked at the bottom of the page for the complete listing of potion/poison progression.)

<h4>Waitaminute ... Imbues?</h4>
Starting in tier 2, certain items can be imbued with a proc as part of the crafting process. In the case of scholars, this is limited to imbued rings. These rings will have a chance to proc when a certain event happens (depending on the imbue, it can proc when the wearer takes damage, or casts a certain type of spell.) The proc will boost a single stat (such as an imbued ring of wisdom boosting WIS) for a short time, as well as some other beneficial effect.
<h4>Reaction Arts</h4>
Ah, that sneaky crafting trainer!  When you spoke to the trainer to be certified in your level 10 crafting choice, he/she quietly added a new set of Scholar-specific reaction arts to your Knowledge Book. These tier 2 reaction arts focus on regaining or "buffing" durability, giving you an easier time in gaining pristine quality on your items.  (Note that reaction arts can be used to boost durability or progress any time during the crafting process, not just as a reaction to a crafting event.)
<p>When making tank essences, potions or poisons, you will be using the Chemistry reaction arts. When making spell scrolls, you will be using Scribing reaction arts. When working on jewelry or scout runes, you will use the Artificing arts. In each of these cases, the easiest way to find the proper reaction arts is by sorting the Tradeskill section of your Knowledge Book (K) across by category. A quick mouseover on the icons once this is done should enable you to find your Chemistry, Scribing and Artificing reaction arts, so that you can arrange them on hotbars for easy access.</p>

<h3>The Resources</h3>
When working with scholar recipes, you will find yourself using items from tier 2 gem, ore, wood and root nodes, as well as possibly a few hides from the dens. These nodes can be found in Antonica, Commonlands, and the far eastern portions of Greater Faydark.
<p>The common root of the tier, tuber strand, is used in quite a few recipes. Note that tubers have the same graphic as the filament fuels that the loom uses, instead of the "root" graphic used by the common roots of every other tier. They are also the only common root to not have the word "root" in the name, which can be confusing on broker searches.</p>
<p>Other common resources from tier 2 that are of interest to scholars are: iron cluster (common ore) that is mostly used in jewelcraft and scout runes, rough turquoise (common gem), electrum cluster (common soft metal), salty loam (used especially in tank essences and potions/poisons), severed maple (common wood used in spell scrolls), and tanned leather pelts that are used in belts.</p>
With harvesting skills of 20 or higher (easily obtainable in tier one zones), you should be able to easily harvest these resources for yourself.
<h3>The Rares</h3>
Rough coral is used to make adepts for priest classes, as well as jewelry suitable for INT/WIS casters. The rare soft metal from the gem nodes, silver cluster, is used for mage adepts, as well as for rare jewelry with tank-type stats. The rare loam from the ore nodes, alkaline, is used for both tank and scout adepts.
<p>In addition to these rares, you will also find that on the jewelry end of things small uses for blackened iron (the ore rare) for secondary/ranged items, cured leather pelts (the hide rare) for belts, and sisal root (the root rare) for a rare scarf.</p>
<p>The imbue material of the tier is "glowing" material, that is listed as a rare harvesting event on tier 2 nodes. (While many crafters view it as merely uncommon, not a rare, it is officially considered a rare event, so is listed here.) This material can be used by the scholar for making imbued rings.
<h3>Magic Dust!</h3>
If you complete a tier 2 adept 3 recipe to pristine quality level, you will receive two shimmering dust. (You will receive one dust if you complete to the third quality level on the adept, and none on the first two quality levels.) This dust "byproduct" is then used as the primary ingredient for tier 2 rare potions and poisons.
<h3>The Books</h3>
The scholar essential books can be found on the crafting trainer NPCs, generally found outside the various crafting instances. (For Kelethin, she is standing outside the Tunare's Pages building). Your Advanced scholars recipes, volumes 10-19, are drops in chests off creatures that are level 10-19, and are needed if you want to create adepts, rare jewelry and rare potions and poisons in that tier.
<p>There are also three Enigma books that you <i>can</i> scribe during your time as a scholar (Enigma of the Sage Volume 2, Enigma of the Alchemist Volume 2, and Enigma of the Jeweler Volume 2) that are used for making adornments. However, the adornment system tends to be confusing and overwhelming for many players, so, for now, just know that these books exist as drops on the corpses of tier 2 humanoid-type mobs, and that level 15 and higher scholars can obtain and scribe all three of them, if they desire. <i>(Also note that the Enigma of the Sage Volume 2 book is empty until Game Update 31. You can scribe the book before then, but you will not have any recipes available from it until GU31 is patched to the Live servers.)</i> </p>
<h4>Quick Reminders</h4>
<ol><li>Harvesting your own resources makes a lot of sense, especially in the lower tiers. It keeps your costs down, and gives you a chance at valuable rares that you can either use for yourself, or sell to help fund your crafting addiction.</li>
<li>Your largest amounts of tradeskill experience comes from making one pristine combine for every recipe. We tend to refer to this as "discovery xp."</li>
<li>Just because you have hit level 10, don't mentally block out the fact that you still have level 1-9 artisan recipes and tier 1 resources. These can be a good source of additional tradeskill experience, as well as some very low-cost skillup options, due to the lesser fuel costs for tier 1.</li>
</ol>

95 secondary Echoes of Faydwer and the Crafter So, the NDA has been lifted, and you want to know everything about the expansion and crafting <b><i>NOW</i></b>. While I can keep telling you until I am blue in the face that nothing whatsoever is set in stone until it actually launches on November 14, I am not a big fan of that shade of blue.
<p><i>(I will, however, use blue in the below text to indicate anything that has changed since the morning of November 6)</i></p>
<p>So, I'll give you a nice virtual snack to whet your appetitite and leave you with one extra reminder before I go back to testing. Go ahead and make plans for your future crafting based on what you read here if you must, but realize that any of it could change in a heartbeat. Things WILL still change before launch. Things WILL still change <b>AFTER</b> launch, once they see how everything behaves with ginormous hordes of players poking at them. It is the nature of the beast with something this huge, and if you come crying to me afer launch because you bought up a ton of X in preparation for the launch, and the recipe suddenly changes to need Y instead, I'll likely simply tell you "I told you so!" {grin}</p>
<p>Now that I've given you the obligatory warning (and yes, I know that many of you will totally ignore it, and spend tons of time and money hoarding things you think you'll need, but at least I made the attempt to warn you), on to some actual details of what is coming. After seeing how confused folks are getting during the testing phase, trying to wrap their brains around which who does what, I'm going to start my explanations of the new stuff in a different order, and see if that helps clear things up a bit.</p>
<h3>Something for Everyone - Adornments</h3>
Every crafter of sufficient level can make adornments. Get that fixed in your head right now. Everyone. It doesn't matter what, if anything you choose for your secondary tradeskill, you will have adornment recipes available to you. Of course there is a catch, as there usually is, but don't focus on that. Repeat after me.
<p>Every crafter can make adornments.</p>
<p>Again.  Every crafter can make adornments.</p>
<p>I know this sounds extreme, but there is a reason for it. After WEEKS of trying to unconfuse folks in beta who just could not get all of the systems and subsystems untangled from each other in their minds, you really, really, really want to start with the mental base of keeping adornments totally separate in your mind from everything else. Once you have repeated the above to yourself several times, and you have it solidly embedded in your mind, then move on to the nitty-gritty.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adornments are tradeable items made by crafters to enhance gear.</li>
<li>Any player can apply/use these adornments once they are made.</li>
<li>Every adornment will have a slot listed in the description, and can only be applied to gear that belongs in that equipment slot.</li>
<li>Every adornment will have a level listed that is the minimum level of the gear item that it can adorn. Level 20 adornments, for example, can go on level 20 (or higher gear). You cannot put a higher-level adornment on a lower-level item.</li>
<li>The gear item to be adorned must be at 100% condition. Repair first, then adorn.</li>
<li>Only one adornment can be on an item at any time.</li>
<li>Adornments are permanent, once applied. You can replace the adornment with a different one, but the old adornment is not returned. Once you apply it, it is done - you cannot get it back.</li>
<li>Any item that has been adorned will show extra effect names in yellow when you examine the item, and any stat modifications in blue.</li>
<li>Every tradeskill class will have adornment recipes (sold in the new expansion zones), and no two classes will make the exact same adornment. Now will they all get equal amounts of adornments.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be adornments to add procs to items. Adornments to add resists. Adornments to add stats. An adornment to help you take less damage when you fall. And so on.</p>
<p>When broken down like this, it truly does sound simple. So, why the confusion?</p>
<p>It is because of what adornments are made of. You will craft adornments from the materials created by transmuters. You do not have to choose transmuting as your secondary tradeskill in order to make adornments. However, you DO have to use items that transmuters have created. Just keep repeating to yourself - any class can make adornments. Yes, unless you are exceedingly rich, if you want to make adornments, someone in your crafting army is going to want to transmute, a LOT, but keep reminding yourself that while you need the stuff, you don't have to BE one to make adornments. If you repeat it enough times, you may actually survive your first several dozen confused encounters with customers who haven't got a clue what they want or need, only that they want and need it and think you can make it.</p>
<p>Let that percolate in your brain for a bit, and we'll move on to less confusing topics for a moment before tackling the secondary tradeskills.</p>
<h3>Things that CanNOT be Adorned</h3>
<font color="blue">At this time, the stated plan is for the follow item types to not be allowed to be adorned:
<ul><li>Heritage items</li>
<li>Qeynos Claymore Quest Series items</li>
<li>Godking Weapons</li>
<li>Prismatic Weapons</li>
<li>Imbued tradeskill made items</li></ul></font>

 
<h3>EoF and Harvesting</h3>
Faydwer zones are ... large. In several cases, such as Greater Faydark and Butcherblock Mountains, we throw out the old model of a zone equalling a tier of content, and find that the zone, and the mobs within it, span two tiers, with lower-level content on one side, and higher level content on the other. As with the mobs, so go the nodes. You'll find tier 1 harvesting nodes in the tier 1 portions of Greater Faydark, tier 2 harvesting nodes in the tier 2 portions of Greater Faydark, and so on.
<h3>Cloaks!</h3>
Starting at level 23, and every 10 levels after that, tailors will be able to make cloaks. Think of the recipes that you get for dress clothes, and mentally change them over to cloaks to get a feel for the number of roots you will need for these, with one pelt thrown in for good measure. Rare cloaks will swap one common root for that tier's rare roots. The recipe books for these are brand new and only found in the new expansion. The current plan is for the books to be no-trade, so if you don't buy the expansion, don't expect to be able to make cloaks. Cloaks can be equipped starting at level 20 for the Tier 3 common cloaks, and any cloak can be set to either display the natural colors of the cloak, or your guild's heraldry, if they have chosen one.
<h3>Altars?!</h3>
The little diety quests that we have seen up to this point are nice little introductions, setting the stage for the return of the gods, but they don't actually do much of anything other than give you a neat house item. When EoF is released, expect to see entire series of quests that let you choose which god you wish to worship, then send you out on tasks to help gain favor with that god/goddess and hasten their return into the world. In order to make appropriate offerings to your god and gain various blessings that you can then later use/cast, you are given an altar for that deity that you can place in your home. On top of the altars that are awarded as part of these quests, carpenters can buy recipes for both common and rare altars. <font color="blue">The 8 common altars are level 35 and will use briarwood, feyiron and etched leather. The rare versions of those altars will require ebony, rosewood, adamantine and horned leather.  <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=g104&menustr=070000000000">Screenshots can be found here.</a>  Using crafted altars will give you a reduction in the cost of miracles and blessings that you obtain from your deity. Note that these altars are LORE, which means you can only have one of each type in your inventory. You can, however, have multiples in a home, on the broker, etc.</font>
<h3>Imbues</h3>
<font color="blue"><b>Rewind on the late-breaking news.  Imbues WILL still stay in the game, though no new imbue recipes are likely to be forthcoming in the future.  Imbued items can NOT be adorned.</b></font>
<h3>Another Small Carpenter Bit</h3>
<font color="blue">There will be a tinkered item that will summon a 5-minute mender, that charges higher-than-normal repair rates. (i.e., good for large raids).  In order to balance things a bit so carpenters aren't getting hit too hard by the decrease in demand for repair kits, the plan is to decrease the cost of making repair kits to something a bit more sane, and increase the cost of making the mender.  Current plan is 7.2p for the mender and 12g for the carpenter-made repair kit.</font>
<h3>Secondary Tradeskills</h3>
Adornments are not secondary tradeskills. Adornments can be made by any class of crafter. Got it?  Keep that in your mind. We're about to dive into the spots where folks tend to get that concept tangled up.
<p>Before we tackle that, however, I have a new mantra for you to also repeat: "Secondary tradeskills are meant to be hard." They're not going to be something that everyone wants to do. They will be time-consuming. They will be resource-intensive. They will be expensive. Yes, there will be a huge demand for items from these two secondary tradeskills, but they are meant to be hard. SoE <i>wants</i> them to be hard. Their idea of "hard" and our idea of hard may be two different things, so prepare for this to be a rough and rocky road if you decide you have the time and patience to work on these.</p>
<h4>Raw Skill vs Level</h4>
Before we go into the details of the two secondary skills, let us start with a bit of explaining how the whole skill vs level thing works.
<p>When you train in a secondary skill at crafting level 10 or higher, you start with a raw skill of 10. Every five points of skill equals one level. Therefore, you start with an effective level of two. Your skill cap, meaning the maximum skill that you can gain at any given time, will be your primary crafting level times five.</p>
<p>Many of us find that math is easier with examples, so let's make it easier!
<ul>
<li>A level 15 outfitter trains to become a tinker. His persona sheet will then list them with a tinkering skill of 10/75 (15*5). He can then work on tinkering until skill 75 (level 15 recipes), but is unable to skill up any further until he becomes a level 16 outfitter. (At which time he gains another 5 points to his tinkering cap, allowing him to reach a raw skill of 80.)</li>
<li>A level 70 carpenter trains to become a transmuter. Her persona sheet will then list her as having a 10/350 (70*5). She can transmute to her heart's content, providing she can find the materials to do so, as the maximum cap to her transmuting skill is the current game-maximum. 10 points down, 340 to go!</li></ul>
Ok, so "level" equals raw skill divided by five. Recipes will show in your book by level, but <i>skillups</i> change your raw skill. Expect folks, including you, to get the two confused now and then, especially since there's no xp bar for your secondary tradeskill.  (You gain in skill/levels as you slowly get skillups from the crafting process.)
<h4>Tinkering</h4>
Before the Shattering, only gnomes learned the art of tinkering - making whirlygigs and thingamabobs with complex names that often did quite simple tasks. In some cases, they also had some interesting side effects! Times have changed, and tinkering can now be learned by any level 10 or higher crafter.
<p>There are items like rebreathers (head slot, enduring breath effect), items to summon limited pets, items to increase a crafting skill, and much more.</p>
<p> So, what's the catch that makes this so hard? They use boatloads of resources. Not just little kayak-sized boatloads,, but huge ginormous cruise ship sized boatloads. Starting with tier 2, you'll want to have loam coming out of your ears, followed closely by ore, add in a bit of the jewelcraft soft metal for good measure, then add in bits and pieces of gems, hides and wood now and again.  Did I mention lots of loam? And ore?  And lots of loam?  Don't forget the loam, 'k?</p>
<h4>Transmuting</h4>
Stretch. Breathe. Just for a couple moments to just let some of that percolate through your mind before you tackle this next bit. Your brain will likely thank me later.
<p>In simplest terms, transmuting is breaking down or recycling valuable items into bits and pieces of ... stuff.  While this sounds pretty simple on the surface, there is a lot more to it than that. If it truly was that easy, there wouldn't be this many confused folks running around!</p>
<ul>
<li>Items that can be transmuted include Treasured or better gear, adepts and master spells. "Gear" means wearable/attuneable stuff - armor, weapons, symbols, shields, hex dolls and the like.  It does NOT include stackables (food, drink, newer poisons and potions, lore and legend drops, etc.) or furniture, etc.</li>
<li>What you can transmute from the above list will be based on your raw skill, so with a starting skill of 10 (remember level = skill/5, so this equals level 2) versus the level of the item, you're going to be looking at transmuting level 1 and level 2 gear. It is good to note at this point that tier 1 rare gear has a level requirement of level 2, so will be a good target for your initial few skillups. After that, you'll be looking at crafted adepts and box drops.</li>
<li>You currently can't transmute items above your transmute level (skill/5), though there may be some "wiggle room" added in still</li>
<li>Skillups from breaking down items will be more common within 2 item levels of your current skill. If you have a 25/350 transmuting skill, for example, which equals level 5, your best chance for skillups will be level 4 and level 5 items.</li>
<li>Rewind your brain at this point, and note that I mention the level of the items, NOT the level of the recipe used to make it, if you're working on mastercrafted items, so most of your mastercrafted stuff will only be good for skillups at the start of the tier, other than adepts.</li>
<li>Transmuting results will be based on the tier of the item. Tier 1 items return tier 1 components, tier 2 returns tier 2 components, etc.</li>
<li>Items received from transmuting will include, from most common to most rare: fragments, powder, infusion, and the very rare mana vial. Which one you get will be sort of random, based on the item you have munged.  Mastercrafted items will most often give you fragments, sometimes give you powder, once in a very great while will give you an infusion, and once in a really great while, two of the above from a single item. Ditto for treasured items. Fabled items will be more likely to give you an infusion, and once in a blue moon will give you a mana vial.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, you may or may not have processed the above enough to realize that you're going to be breaking down a LOT of items in each tier that come from box drops. Tier-based box drops.  Let that percolate for a bit.</p>
<p>Now comes the real kicker, and keep repeating to yourself that it is still in beta, and things can change.  At this time, and again, this can change, once you hit skill 100 (level 20), you will no longer be able to gain experience from breaking down items, but only from making the transmuter-specific adornments. (Not your adornment recipes from your primary tradeskill, but only the ones found in the "Enigma of the Transmuter" books.) <font color="blue">Things are changing in these last couple of days of beta, so that the transmuter-specific adornments include recipes that use the more common transmute materials, so the skillup path should be a bit saner than originally feared.</font>
</p>
<h4>Hey, 'Mum, What if I Change My Mind?</h4>
<font color="blue">If you feel you have chosen the wrong secondary tradeskill, there is a mechanism in place to allow you to reset your tinkering/transmuting choice.  Realize, however, that it will reset you to base skill level in the new secondary choice, and you'll have to start over scribing recipes, gaining skillups, etc.</font>
<p>Now, off with the lot of you. I've got a lot of stuff still to test, and it has <a href="http://gypsylynx.eqtraders.com/index.php?/archives/2006/11/06.html">been a rough week already.</a> 2006-11-12 11:06:49 2006-07-26 06:38:45 Niami Denmother 0 1 2013-08-20 12:29:29 Niami Denmother

2 Niami Denmother The 800 Pound Gorilla ... Taken from the press release regarding the launch of EQ2:
<p>
<b>SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT?S EVERQUEST? II SHIPPING NOVEMBER 8th </b>
<p>
-The 800-Pound Gorilla of Online Gaming Is Ready to Play -
<p>
SAN DIEGO, CA ? October 25, 2004 ? Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (SOE), a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online (MMO) gaming, today announced that EverQuest II is scheduled to simultaneously ship to North American and European retail stores on November 8, 2004.  EverQuest II is the highly-anticipated follow-up to Sony Online Entertainment?s original EverQuest, the most successful and longest-running 3D MMO role-playing game in North America.  
<p>
<p>
The complete press release can be <a href=\"http://eq2players.station.sony.com/news_archive.vm?section=Headline&id=215\" target=\"_new\">found here.</a>
<p>
Meanwhile, we\'re going to be scrambling for the next little bit trying to get the site more fleshed out while we simultaneously continue to test tradeskills, run the main EQTC site, etc. ... and finish one last beta giveaway for those who want a sneak peek before November 8.  Until we\'ve got the database and other content ready, the EQ2TC message boards are your best bet for details on EQ2 tradeskills. 2004-10-25 04:17:58 0
3 Niami Denmother Artisan Feel the Love! While some of us are planning on being a solid mix of artisan and adventurer, some folks have expressed a desire to be a \"pure\" artisan, avoiding combat wherever possible. One of thie biggest sticking points for folks has been that they have to kill several mobs to complete their citizenship quest and gain access to the city. Fear not! There <i>is</i> love for artisans!<p>
Today\'s beta patch message included the following item:<p>
<blockquote>The cities of Freeport and Qeynos now place a higher importance on the craftsmanship of their skilled laborers. Artisans who are not already citizens will automatically be granted citizenship when they\'ve obtained artisan level 6.</blockquote> 2004-10-28 10:54:26 0
4 Niami Denmother Saturday, Oct. 30 - beta test day! <p>For those of you in the EQ2 beta, but not able to access the beta forums, here\'s a snippet of news about tomorrow from SOE:</p>
<blockquote>Yes, that\'s right, we\'re going to be doing some odd testing on Saturday, in preparation for our release.
 
Tomorrow morning around 10AM Pacific time, we\'re going to be opening up several more servers for testing. If you haven\'t filled up your character slots, please join us in testing the new servers. Go in, have some fun, and play a bit. We\'ll probably shut them back down at Noon, so don\'t get too attached to your characters there. They will be wiped :)
 
Secondly, at 6 PM Pacific time, we\'ll be shutting down all English servers (Beta 1, 2 and 3) for about 2 minutes. We\'ll then open them back up, and we\'ll see how they handle the stress of every logging in at the same time.
 
We appreciate your help in these two tests. If you\'ve got time, we\'d love to see you there!

Producer, EverQuest II

5 Niami Denmother The Best Laid Plans ... ... sometimes go awry. It was with the best of intentions that they added the ability for artisans to gain citizenship without completing the citizenship, but it didn\'t quite work the way that they intended.  From today\'s patch message on beta:
<blockquote>Due to some quest-related issues, artisans above level 6 will no longer be automatically granted citizenship. For now they will have to complete the adventurer\'s path toward citizenship. We apologize to artisans, and plan to revisit the situation after launch.</blockquote>
So, while they do intend to go back and redo this, due to the issues involved, don\'t expect it to be ready until sometime after launch. 2004-11-02 10:52:52 0
6 Niami Denmother Beta Ending Annoucement <p>Please note that since this announcement (which had been circulated to our site seecondhand), SOE has decided to extend the duration of beta another 12 hours, putting the new end time at noon Pacific tomorrow (Saturday). I have personally confirmed this directly with Sean, who was kind enough to respond to my email after the close of business today.  :) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>On behalf of the entire EverQuest II team, I want to thank everyone who has participated in our beta test over the last several months on the English, French, and German servers. Your feedback has been immeasurably valuable throughout the testing process by helping us find bugs and polish our gameplay. EverQuest II wouldn't be what it is today without your involvement.
<p>
We're very excited that EverQuest II will be launching on November 8. In preparation for the release of the game, our beta test will be concluding Friday night, November 5. At midnight PST, we will be shutting down the beta servers and deleting all characters and items. Our official forums will be temporarily closing at the same time so that we can restructure the boards and be ready for a fresh start when the game goes live.
<p>
EverQuest II will begin shipping to retailers in the US on Monday, November 8, with dozens of servers awaiting the arrival of thousands of players into a brand new world. The European versions of EverQuest II will begin shipping across Europe on November 11, with French and German language servers ready for play.
<p>
EverQuest II comes in three versions, all of which include a 30-day subscription (excluding Station Access subscriptions) to the game?s online world. The CD and DVD versions of the game carry an SRP of $49.99 and include the game, an in-game item and an in-box item. Limited quantities of the EverQuest II Collector?s Edition (DVD) are available at an SRP of $89.99. 
<p>
We hope you enjoy your last hours in the EverQuest II beta. Though the testing process has come to an end, your adventure in Norrath has only just begun.

7 Niami Denmother EQ2 Live! Whether you\'re already in-game, or, like hubby and I, still waiting for your copies of the software (our local EB won\'t have our preorders available until the 10th), you\'ve probably figured out by now that the initial servers are up, and the long-awaited release of EverQuest II has happened. While I know it\'s frustrating for those not in the game already, and you\'re eager for more information about tradeskills, etc., try to keep it semi-tame in the forums, k?  ;)
<p>Meanwhile, while hubby and I are champing at the bit and faced with up to 2 more days before we can get into the game, work is being done on the site\'s database. While some of the basic structure from the EQTC site could be used, there\'s a lot that\'s different with items, recipes, and such, so Ngreth\'s having to do a lot of extra recoding while I\'m working on various guides and some of the data entry (assisted in the data entry, of course, by a lovely team of volunteers!). We can\'t give you an exact ETA right now, but know that we are working on getting up all the recipes and such as soon as possible. 2004-11-08 05:41:04 2007-11-08 10:03:57 1 Niami Denmother
8 Niami Denmother Harvesting Hint A lot of folks have been having issues getting their harvesting skills up. It often seems there just aren\'t enough tier 1 nodes to go around. There\'s a bit that you can to do to help the situation in some zones, though. Each zone has a set number of resource/quest nodes available at a given time, zonewide. Lots of times, after a zone has been picked over by folks for a bit, it seems there\'s not only a lot of gardens lying around, but a ton of fish nodes.  Make sure your clearing the fish nodes out of the water (if the hand icon shows up when you mouse over a fish, it\'s harvestable) in order to clear up some spawns and have a chance at random respawn of something more useful.  It won\'t totally make up for the fact that there\'s the standard \"just after launch\" crowding at the lower levels, but it will help a bit.  (As an example, I found twenty fish nodes active at the same time in the front pond in the Forest Ruins yesterday - no wonder nobody could find anything else there!) 2004-11-13 10:36:11 0
9 Niami Denmother Suspensions! There weren\'t patch notes on the login screen to go with this morning\'s patch, but we can confirm that the various suspensions needed for poisons, potions and fighter skill upgrades went on the tradeskill society vendors today.</p>
<p>While I\'ve got your attention, I\'d like to remind folks that are looking for information that there\'s more than one spot for them to look. The \"How To\" section over there on your left navbar has had several more articles added. The \"Quests\" section has not only the writeup on the Isle of Refuge tradeskill quest, but also a bit about the tasks for your tradeskill societies. Then, of course, there are the forums. We do ask that when you\'re coming to the fourms with a question that you check the sticky FAQ in the General forum, then do a quick search to see if there is a thread or ten on the subject already. We\'re getting a LOT of repeat questions over there of things that have been answered several times in that same day, and a bit of research on your part will save you from having egg on your face when folks point you to the multiple spots where that\'s already been answered. {grins}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, know that we\'re hard at work on getting not only the database up and running, but also on getting more helpful guides in place to handle some of the more common questions that require detailed responses. It may seem like slow progress to some of you who are eagerly awaiting every scrap of information, but we\'re getting quite a bit accomplished every day, and hope to be more fleshed out with our site offerings soon. 2004-11-16 04:48:36 0

92 Niami Denmother Viltality potions and other issues There are currently some issues with the birthday rewards - hotfixes are being planned. I found the following from Blackguard:
<blockquote>There is currently an issue that is calculating the amount of vitality you should be getting incorrectly when you log in. This will be fixed tomorrow, and all characters will receive full Adventure and Tradeskill Vitality at that time. We recommend that you do not use a vitality potion at this time unless you are able to use up all of the vitality it grants you before tomorrow morning.</blockquote>
In another spot, it was mentioned that although your /claim may only list a potion for a reward when the posted list mentions several rewards for that tier, it actually will give you all the items from that tier when you claim the item. An upcoming hotfix (no ETA) will modify the tooltip to include the entire list. 2005-11-09 04:26:24 0

<ul><li>Saliva of all types will no longer be usable as a substitution for
liquid in tradeskill recipes. Apparently there have been too many cases

99 Niami Denmother Major Tradeskill Changes Incoming There\'s been a bit of a hullaballoo due to some changes that hit the Test server without warning the other day.  We\'ve now got confirmation from Beghn that subcombines will be going away, potions/poisons may be changing a bit, and a few other things. There\'s a lot to parse and process, and a lot of questions, and if I try to paraphrase it, I\'m likely to muck something up. So, I\'ve <a href=\"http://www.mboards.eqtraders.com/eq2/showthread.php?t=5551\">a thread in our general tradeskills forum with the current quotes from Beghn regarding the issue</a> (multiple posts in the same thread). 2006-01-17 11:17:53 0

101 Niami Denmother LU19 Due February 2 <h3>Sony Online Entertainment MEDIA ALERT</h3><br>
<b>EVERQUEST II LIVE UPDATE 19 SCHEDULED FOR FEBRUARY 2</b><br>
<b>Update to Incorporate New Character Progression, All-New Tutorial,  Content Overhaul</b>
<p>
<i>SAN DIEGO, Calif. ? January 27, 2006 ? Sony Online Entertainment announced their preparations for the 19th update to EverQuest II, slated to launch on game servers February 2. This update will bring significant changes to the game, and is a precursor to the launch of the new Player vs. Player game servers, scheduled for late February. </i></p>
<p><i>The most noticeable addition to this update is the new Character Progression system.  The gradual Archetype progression has been changed, and players will be able to choose their final class at the beginning of the game, rather than working their way up to level 20.  This change means that the class system will be a more unique experience for players at low levels, and give  players access to unique spells and abilities that set their class apart. Newly-created characters will also begin with new class-specific gear that will further differentiate players and make the world feel more diverse. </i></p>
<p><i>The game?s Tutorial section has also been dramatically changed. SOE would like to bid a fond farewell to Captain Varlos and the good ship Far Journey, as new players will now begin on one of two new islands, either the Outpost of the Overlord (evil) or the Queen?s Colony (good). The islands still serve as a ?newbie? introduction to the game, but are much different from each other and contain a number of quests to get players started.</i></p>
<p><i>In addition to benefits for new players, one of the best dungeons in EQII, Solusek?s Eye, is receiving a content overhaul, with new high-level action and rewards for players in the late 40s ? 50s level range. This awe-inspiring dungeon is now the home to new, powerful items, including fiery red equipment to match the dungeon?s theme. Additionally, the new quests create a foundation for the storyline that will develop in Kingdom of Sky, the next EQII expansion scheduled for February 21.</i></p>
<p><i>Additional changes in Live Update 19 include: changes to Mentoring to make it more fun for those helping their lower-level friends; the ability to send cross-faction mail (good characters can now send items and coin to evil characters and vice versa); a cleaner and clearer Adventure writs system; expanded vault storage space in some of the premium player housing; and tons of tweaks to the game?s user interface....</i></p>
<p>To read more of the above press release, including patch notes, please check out <a href="<!--server:x-->articles/article_page.php?article=g66">this article.</a> One little niggly to note that's likely to catch us all, repeatedly, is the remapping of the recipe book key.  Go ... read!</p>
<p>Not mentioned in the above article, but especially important to tradeskillers, is the fact that recipes for all level 1-19 spells, skills and combat arts are going to be changed to the new system of raws directly into final product, due to the changes to spells/arts of those levels from the player progression changes. Do not let this change catch you by surprise - you have been warned about this more than once now, and I'm unlikely to be the only one resisting (or failing to resist) the 'I told you so' for those unwilling to do a bit of reading now and then in a game that warns you up front that things will change. {grins} 2006-01-28 11:25:02 2006-01-28 11:27:31 2006-01-28 11:26:52 0 Niami Denmother
492 Niami Denmother Brew Day Festivities! Brew Day is not just for drunken dwarves and followers of Brell! Make sure to check out the <b><a href=\"http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q85&menustr=060000000000\">Brew Day preview</a></b> for details on this annual event, which runs from March 11 through March 22. There is a wonderful pack that has a visible appearance amongst the several crafted items, and you will want to read up to make sure that you do not miss the quest to obtain the improved ale goggles (so you can see the nodes needed for the crafting components), as well as the quest to obtain the pack recipe. 2010-03-11 12:26:02 0
493 Niami Denmother Brewday Bar Delay Apparently there was a large bar brawl in the Brewday bars, or so says the system announcement.  The bartenders are expected to have cleanup done, and the bars open, around 11 am Pacific, at last check.  (All the rest of the Brewday stuff is available, but since all the crafting requires access to the bar before you can harvest, much less craft, um, you might want to go grab glowies, harvest more resources, etc. for a bit.) 2010-03-11 11:04:10 0
494 Niami Denmother Tuesday Treasures! I hope everyone has been having fun with the Brew Day celebrations, which will end on the 22nd. There are a lot of other events looming on the horizon, including another Moonlight Enchantments, another City Festival, and more! What more, you ask, in this season of bountiful live events?  How about a celebration for that grand Trickster, god of Mischief, creator of halflings, Bristlebane?  

<p>Yep, that is right. Bristlebane Day is right around the corner, and, for the first time, there will be Bristlebane Day craftables!  Of <i>course</i> Mum is making sure you are properly pampered and has a <b><a href=\"http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q89&menustr=060000000000\">Bristlebane Day crafting writeup</a></b> for you!</p>
<p>In a lovely update to the <b><a href=\"http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q87&menustr=060000000000\">Shadows of the Betrayed</a></b> signature quest, once you have completed the quest you may buy an extra copy of your class reward from the Shady Swashbuckler on the Nektulos Forest docks. This will allow you to have one for decorating your home, and one for using for evac or appearance!  Thanks, Domino!</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by the overflowing abundance of crafter & decorator love? Perplexed by the plethora of planned parties and other events? It is getting a tad hard to keep track of what starts and ends when, much less which SF crafting dailies you can or cannot do on any given day, or when you can catch the next Portal Repairs mission for the signature quest.  In an attempt to beat it all into submission, I am poking and prodding the forum Calendar feature into submission. The app is a bit limited, but it might just do the trick ... I hope! Down at the very bottom of the main forum page, you will find a Today\'s Events section that will give you an abbreviated listing of SF daily crafting missions, Mara daily crafting mission and any world events. Should you want further information, or a longer-term view, the <b><a href=\"http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq2/calendar.php\">Calendar</a></b> link at the top of our forums leads to, unsurprisingly, the calendar view of the events. Each event comes with a clickable link that will lead you to another link with any additional details that are available for the event.</p>
<p>There are, of course downsides, such as the event-click leading to another link that needs to be clicked before you get to the event writeup, and a repeat event function that works so poorly that I will have to manually add the repeating events, one by one by one to the proper days, but it offers us an option that is integrated with the site, and allows you, with a quick glance at the forums, to see what is going on of crafter interest.  Poke at it, try it out, see what you think. Once I see what the general response is, and we have made sure the information I already have up is accurate, I can see about filling in the events for April as well.</p> 2010-03-16 07:31:01 0
495 Niami Denmother Friday Grab Bag <p>There is now a chart up with the <b><a href="http://www.eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g419&menustr=040000000000">Tier 9 5-hour food & drink</b></a>, since I'm a bit slow in getting a chart up of all of the food and drink from that tier.</p>
<p>In addition, I want to remind folks that not only does Brewday end in a couple days (the 22nd), but this weekend should see another <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g329&menustr=080000000000">Moonlight Enchantments</a></b> event on March 20-21.</p>
<p>The hubbyogre also found an oops on our new <b><a href=http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq2/calendar.php>Calendar</a></b>, which is being fixed now.  I have still gotten VERY little feedback regarding the calendar and whether folks think it is useful, and I am loathe to spend a solid chunk of time filling out of the events for April until I hear a bit more.</p> 2010-03-19 11:10:10 2010-03-19 11:22:06 2010-03-19 11:21:54 0 Niami Denmother
496 Niami Denmother Friday Update The master list of <b><a href=\"http://www.eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g420&menustr=040000000000\">T9 Food and Drink</a></b> is now in place.  The feedback from the <b><a href=\"http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq2/calendar.php\">Crafting Calendar</a></b> has been positive, and I will be updating the April events on it this weekend. In addition, as soon as the custom coding can be done to link it in to the main site menubar, for those that are not prone to visiting our forums, a link will be added.  (I am hoping that the hubbyogre has the time to tackle it this weekend.) 2010-03-26 02:12:42 0

498 Niami Denmother Events! The City Festival for this month is located just outside of <b><a href=\"http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q67&menustr=080000000000\">Qeynos</a></b> and will be located there through April 7.

(The 1-day part only pertains to the special EL nodes, Frostfell equipment and such. As mentioned before, the rest of the Bristlebane Day stuff is running through April 11.) 2010-04-01 01:17:05 0
499 Niami Denmother Goodies for the Weekend <p>Firstly, another Double Station Cash weekend has been announced.  Buy the Free Realms branded Station Cash cards and claim them between Friday 4pm PST and Sunday 11pm PST and you'll get DOUBLE the face value in your wallet - this Station Cash can then be spent in any SOE game tied to your account.<p>
<p>Secondly, a bit of New Halas lore has been released on the eq2players site. <b><a href="http://eq2players.station.sony.com/news/read/current/3508" target="_new">Check it out here.</a></b></p>
<p>Thirdly, keep in mind that the Qeynos City Festival is running through April 7, and the main Bristlebane Day stuff is running through April 11.

500 Niami Denmother Patch Stuff There are a few tradeskill-related items that went in with the patch this morning:

<ul><li>Balanced Ayr Stones are now Adornments of Avoidance (Superior). They grant Riposte Chance and can only be applied on Neck slot items.</li>
<li>Focused and Specialist?s Reprieve potions can no longer be auto-consumed.</li>
<li>Stats on the Di?Zok Bow of Flame, Riliss Chicken Foot, and Danak Wishbone have been adjusted to be more useful to all the classes that can use these items.</li>
<li>Changed the appearances on many brawler fists so they have a different appearance other than the standard spike bronze pot!</li></ul>

<p>Also, a reminder that the <b><a href=\"http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q67&menustr=080000000000\">Qeynos City Festival</a></b> ends tonight. Get your white marble goodies while you can!</p> 2010-04-07 11:24:39 0

1565 Niami Denmother Things to Look Forward To <p>Today I give you a few things gleaned from Discord.</p>
<p>The PoP tradeskill weekly missions will be fixed with the next update.</p>
<p>The Shard of Hate mission will apparently be changed (again, with the next update), to only require crafting of the Arcane Ocularum (instead of all the harvesting and crafting needed for the sub-parts).<p>
<p>The Molten Throne timed mission (Bridge Run), will have the timer changed for the Portals to Nowhere instance to start AFTER the Fragment of Ro is crafted. (This is also for the next patch.)</p>
<p>The next patch is currently expected to be next week. Next week is also the start of Brewday - wheeeee!</p>
<p>As a side-note, the Familiars Wild quest resets daily at 11 p.m. Pacific.</p> 2018-02-28 04:48:12 0
1573 Niami Denmother Brewday 2018 <p>The annual Brewday celebration begins in just under 3 hours. While I did not convince my Muse to produce a short story to go with it, <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q382&menustr=060000000000">the Brewday Preview</a></b> does give you all the new eye-candy!</p>
<p>There will also be a patch in the morning, but the patch notes have not been posted for it. I suspect there will be the promised changes to two of the daily missions, as well as a fix to the PoP crafting weekly, but other than that, we do not know what will be patched.</p>

<p>As I wander off to do a few more things before my evening ends, I plant this thought in your mind: How many mounts are going to be named "Buckbeak" after folks get their hands on the new Brewday mount? :D</p>

1579 Niami Denmother Patch Stuff of Note <p>On top of Fallen Gate unlocking EoF (tinkering, transmuting and adorning should be available there now, as well as several more crafting quests), there were several items of note for crafters in the patch notes today. It may take me a bit to get these into the proper quest writeups, as I am very low on spoons right now.</p>

<ul><li>Shard of Hate: Eye Spy [Tradeskill] - Writhing ires have gone on permanent vacation, as have a couple other creatures, to make traversing the Shard less dangerous.</li>
<li>Mechanical Travel Gear will now allow those that have completed "A Stitch in Time, Part V: Sealed With Hate" to travel directly to the Coliseum of Valor.</li>
<li>The tradeskill weekly mission, "A Restitch in Time," will properly update through completion of a Planes of Prophecy Dungeon [Tradeskill] Daily Mission.</li>
<li>A Restitch in Time: Eye Spy - The 3 components for the Arcane Ocularum obtained via The Fiend Fount no longer need to be crafted. Instead, gathering resources and exchanging those resources for the components through The Fiend Fount is all that is required.</li>
<li>A Restitch in Time: Bridge Run - The timer for this mission has been removed.</li>
<li>Doctor's Orders: Shard of Hate now grants rare harvests and a chance to receive Celestial Teachings for those that have completed A Stitch in Time, Part V: Sealed With Hate. <i>(Mum note: This is the PQ that has both crafting and adventuring components.)</i></li>
<li>Restitch in Time daily and weekly missions no longer grant any infusers, and can now reward a progress potion.</li>
<li>Familiars Wild quest will now update correctly for creatures that fall into multiple creature classifications such as many wolves being both dire and canine.</li>
<li>Restitch in time daily missions now grants Far Seas Trading Company Tokens and Ancient Rubicite Relics.</li>
<li>Restitch in Time weekly mission now grants Far Seas Trading Company Tokens.</li></ul> 2018-03-06 12:57:29 0
1581 Niami Denmother Busy, Busy <p>For the next couple of days we will be testing <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q394&menustr=080000000000">Beast'r</a></b> on the Test server. I will have up some details soon-ish. I am awaiting word on if we will see anything on Test for Chronoportals before they go live, and we will begin Bristlebane Day testing in about a week. (Lots and lots of event overlap this year!)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thanks to a response to my post in the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq2/forumdisplay.php?f=72">Help Wanted forum</a>, I obtained the text to the <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q390&menustr=060000000000">entire dialog for the Stitch in Time sig line</a></b>.

(And a great way for those of you who have not completed the questline yet to see the storyline.)</p>

1583 Niami Denmother Happy Anniversary! <p>It is time to wish the original EverQuest a happy 19th annniversary. In addition to some <a href="https://www.everquest2.com/news/eq2-krono-sale-redemption-bonus-march-2018">special krono deals</a>, EQ2 is now experiencing double XP until the end of Monday the 19th. The 19th will also begin the Chronoportal Phenomenon, which will allow us to revisit certain EQ encounters/mobs. Rather than make a new article for this event, I will be updating <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q281&menustr=080000000000">the Chronoportals article</a></b> shortly to reflect 2018 dates and the five new paintings that we can buy. (Link has now been added to this news article.)</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> In addition to adding the Chronoportals link above now that I have finished the article, there is also <b><a href="https://www.everquest2.com/news/producers-letter-march-2018">a new Producer's Letter out</a></b> -- and it briefly mentions that there will be two new summer events this year. As more details are available, I will post accordingly, but I suspect it will be a couple months before we know more.</p> 2018-03-16 01:10:17 2018-03-16 04:24:09 2018-03-16 06:19:41 1 Niami Denmother
1585 Niami Denmother Moonlight News <p>This just came across the EverQuest2 facebook page:

<blockquote>Moonlight Enchantments are happening now! Though the rings have appeared as usual this month, we've got a peculiar feeling that something new may be involved the next time around...</blockquote>
<p>This likely refers to the new Moonlight Enchantment items that were hinted at a few months ago. When more details are available, I will post them.</p>
<h3>** NOTEBOOK WARNING! ** NOTEBOOK WARNING **</h3>
<p>Today introduced stacking AND a bug to playermade notebooks. The short version, to save my fingers, is that if you have two playermade notebooks of the same base type (rawhide, etc., etc), you risk overwriting one with the other. So, if you have one rawhide leather notebook with one batch of text, and one with another batch of text, picking one up while the other is in inventory will overwrite. The same goes for pushing one into the moving crate when there's another of that type, but not that title, already in there. A bug was just put in, well after hours today, so it is too soon to get a dev response and an ETA on the fix. PLEASE pass the word on this, so nobody tries to pack up and move their library before this is fixed, etc.</p> 2018-03-20 05:46:27 2018-03-20 09:14:56 2018-03-20 09:07:34 0 Niami Denmother
1589 Niami Denmother Bristlebane Day and More <p>First, Bristlebane Day is on Test. Yes, I <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q401&menustr=080000000000">have the eye-candy for you already</a></b>. The article needs fleshing out, and I will try to pull the story out of my brain before the event goes live as well.</p>

<p>The issue with player-written notebooks (which also affects signs) will be patched on Tuesday the 27th. Until then, you risk overwriting the contents of your player-written book if you pick it up, pack it, unpack it, sell it or buy it when there is another notebook (either blank or a different title) in the target container that uses the same cover. So tread VERY carefully if you have to use player-written books before next Tuesday. When in doubt, leave them exactly where they are at this moment, and do not touch them again until Tuesday.</p> 2018-03-21 04:57:11 0
1593 Niami Denmother Crash Issues <p>There were crash issues after the patch today and the DBG folks have been hard at work chasing it down.

<tr><td><!--image:events/beastr_border.jpg--></td></tr></table>

<p>The Beast'r Egg hunt quietly began in 2017 with no fanfare. This year, the event is becoming a bit more formalized, with advanced warning as well as new eggs to hunt. Here's what Kaitheel has to say about the event:</p>
<blockquote>Each year, at the beginning of the season of Growth, Tunare whispers to the animals of the forest to let them know that the season is about to start  it is her Promise to them. In their excitement, the animals begin behaving exuberantly, looking forward to the gifts of nature that come along with the season of renewal. The small animals especially are excited (squirrels, rabbits, birds, foxes, and the like), because this is when they either look for mates or bring out their young for the first time. You don't have to be a druid or a fellow worshiper of Tunare to celebrate the season of Growth, for all are welcome!</blockquote>

<p>The basic premise of this little event is that there are beast'r eggs hopping around the cities and starter areas in Norrath, and you get to try to hunt them down and grab them. If you manage to grab one, you get an heiroom fluff pet "gem" (scroll) of the egg. This year there are also"Beast'r Eggschanger" NPCs in Qeynos Province District, Freeport, Darklight Wood, Greater Faydark, Timorous Deep, and Frostfang Sea. This NPC will let you trade in the heirloom fluff pet gem for a housepet version.</p>

<h3>The Eggs</h3>
<p>The five egg types from last year return as well as six new ones this year.</p>

<p>With the release of GU107 on July 31, a new optional tradeskill mission is also being released for members. <b>This mission will require that you be a level 110 crafter who has completed <a><href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q351&menustr=060000000000">the Planes of Prophecy crafting line</a>. We have found out that it also requires membership.</b> It is an optional daily quest that can be completed during every "daily" (18-hour) mission cycle. (It now counts for the PoP tradeskill weekly, but is not part of the rotation from Hilgrid). It also contains red shinies for a new 20-piece collection.</p>
<p>You will find details on the collection reward and the achievement reward at the bottom of the page, after the walk-through. The video walk-through, which is highly recommended, can be found <b><a href="https://youtu.be/Ebc6hqeZXjY">on YouTube</a></b>.</p>
<p><b>You will need 100 celestial coal <font color="red">and 1200 PoP common harvests</font> per run-through of this instance.</b> (The harvests were added between beta and live, so are a late addition to the walk-through.)</p>

<h2>Do NOT Try to Mass-produce These!!! Firstly, you only need 2 combines, so it is a waste of materials, and secondly, no matter how many you try to make at once, mass production will only give you the one stack of 50. Do 2 single combines, so you have 2 stacks of 50 each, k?</h2>
<h3>Short Version Walkthrough</h3>

<p>Grab the mission from froglok NPC Griv, who is with all the other PoP mission NPCs in Valor. Zone out to Plane of Magic, find the green portal ahead and to your right, and zone into the tradeskill version of the instance. Harvest FOUR "Remnant of Valor". One spawn is right near the entrance, across from the forge and it will yield 2. The other spawns vary. If you can't get to them without risking death, then craft the first round, then use the crafting chalice to zap a frog, harvest the remnant that spawns on it's death spot and craft another batch. (You only need 2 combines, for a total of 100 chalices.) Progress through the zone as if it was <b><a href="http://eq2.wikia.com/wiki/The_Ruins_of_Guk:_Halls_of_the_Fallen">this old adventuring zone</a></b> (link leads to the wiki walkthrough), but with you needing to zap the groups of mobs with the crafted chalice before they aggro on you. All gates unlock just as in that walkthrough, with things to click, move, etc. to progress to the end. If you are using the wiki, skip the bit about retrieving the shiny gold trinket in the Molinap section, as that is for adventuring-only.</p>

<p>Yeah, for most of us, that "short version" walkthrough isn't going to cut it, unless you LIKE dying a lot. Most of you are going to need the video (coming in an hour or two).</p>

<h3>Longer Version Walkthrough</h3>

<p>Even with this longer version, you may want the video as well, but this will give you some locs and a better feel for things.</p>

<p>Head to Coliseum of Valor, and find the questgivers in the NE portion of the zone. A froglok named Griv has been added to the lineup there, and he will offer quests based on what you qualify for - 110 crafter with the PoP crafting line done will be offered the tradeskill mission "Restoring Valor". Level 110(?) adventurers will be offered the adventuring missions as well.</p>
<p><table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:guk/gukgriv.jpg--></td></tr></table></p>

<p>Zone of out Valor and into the Plane of Magic, and there is a new green portal ahead and to your right that contains the fabled Guk instances and the Guk tradeskill instance. Zone into the TS instance. <b>(If you end up doing this instance on back-to-back days, remember to check your zone lockout timers with ALT-Z to reset the timer.)</b></p>

<p>Harvest (twice) the Remnant of Valor right near the zone in. This will get you half of what you need. You will then need to either carefully edge forward until you find another one to harvest twice, or you will need to craft first, then zap the first frog you see, harvest the remnant that spawns in it's place, and craft again. Basically, you're going to need 100 restored chalices, and each combine only gives you 50. Work it out how you will.</p>
<p>There's a forge and a scroll stand to your right. On your first visit you will need to click the scroll stand to autoscribe the recipe. If you've already been there, done that, it stays scribed and you can move directly to the forge.</p>

<p><table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:guk/remnantofvalor.jpg--><td><!--image:guk/gukchalice.jpg--></td></tr></table></p>
<p>Brell/conservation procs work on this combine, so if you want to save a plat or two in fuel costs, wear your prayer shawl for the two combines.  :D</p>


<p>Begin to proceed carefully forward - your first roamer will be coming up the path towards you, if he isn't already in sight after you take a few steps.</p>

<p>There are certain specific roamers (covered in the walk-through video), and the mechanic is such that they spawn in one spot, hop a specific route, and then teleport back to their spawn point to loop it again. If you zap a roamer, and, instead of seeing a remnant of valor where the mob had been, you get a "too far away" message at the bottom of the screen with the mob still in your targeting, it means he teleported, and will be heading your way again in short order.</p>

<p>Mobs also like to hide in bushes, so tab target is your friend. Mobs are linked, so if you zap one from a group, the entire group gets zapped -- this makes it handy because you can target a visible mob, and it will light up the rest of the group, showing you where the less easily seen ones are before you find them the hard way and get flattened.  :D</p>

<p>Anyway, proceed forward, zapping undead frogs until you reach the first major room, with a nasty-looking pool in the middle. There are two roamers in this room, several stationary groups to clear, and two groups of goo floating above the pool. Get rid of them all with your handy dandy chalice. Then clear the group of frogs in the room that is off in the eastern corner of this room.</p>
<p>Back in the pool room, one of the entries along the far wall has fungoids visible. Head there, and zap the fungoids until you can take out the Ancient Fungoid (/way 108, -34, -193). Once he is down, a green cloud will start forming from a mushroom hiding in the bushes (/way 96, -35, -207). Click on it to obtain a pure fungus. Head back to that nasty looking pool and jump in and click on the small idol at the bottom center (/way 69, -40, -112) to raise a gate (/way 105, -32, -116) Proceed down this newly accessible area, clearing out stationary mobs as well as roamers, until you reach another room. Clear the entire room: one group to the right of the door, one group to the left of the door, two groups of goo above the center of this room, and Rideepa the Pridefull at the back of this small room. Directly behind where you found Rideepa, there will be a small statue to pick up and move to a pededstal in a room to the east off that first main room. (/way 7, -32, -96)</p>
<p>This triggers a gate at /way 39, -39, -169 and you want to proceed down through there, zapping frogs as needed, including several roamers. A good rule of thumb for the easily lost: once through that now-raised gate, only take LEFT turns until you reach the Font of the Everliving room. Beware, once you get to the stairs above that room you will be meeting a constant stream of spawned roamers that will continue to spawn until you kill Froppit the Everliving in that room. (The only loc I have handy is for the a spot just behind/above Froppit at /way -60, -42, -258 but that will get you headed in the right direction at least!)  Once Froppit is down, head to the top of the small ramp that was beside him (beware the frog to the right at the top of that ramp!) and to the /way I just mentioned for a small puzzle.  There are three wall plates that can be pushed. All 3 need to be pushed in and the sequence can vary. Try pushing in one of them, and if it pops back out, try one of the other two. Eventually, you will figure out the order that they want to be pushed in, and they will stay in. This opened a door at the top of the ramp so that you can continue onwards.</p>
<p>Go through this newly opened spot (/way -80, -43, 263) in the wall behind where Froppit was, clearing mobs as you head down the ramp. Beware the crocodile that is located <i>just</i> after you finish with the ramp, right before you turn to go into the water. Dip your toes in the water, and hug RIGHT to zip over to dry land, clearing a croc or three as you go (including one on said dry land). Progress up the series of ramps that will remind you of a moonlight enchantments instance until you get to the top of the ramp, again, clearing mobs as you go. At the top of this ramp, hang a right, clear another group of mobs, and take out Molinap, a large grumpy drakota on a pile of treasure (/way -77, -31, 388). Retrace your path to the top of the ramp, and go forward a couple more steps along that top area (one more group of frogs to clear), and there will be a newly ungated opening to your right that leads to a darkened well (/way 34, -33, -321). Stand at the top of that well, looking down, and tab-target until you find the aggro croc at the bottom. You will not be able to zap it from here, so keep it targeted and hug the edge to your right as you drop down. This should give you enough distance from the croc to get your bearings until you move into range to zap him.</p>
<h4>Before You Jump: You will not be able to access anything before this point once you jump, unless you evac or die between this point and the Usurper. Make sure you have found your first three red shinies (first pool room, Froppit's room and near Molinap) before you jump!</h4>
<p>Once he is out of the way proceed onwards -- I recommend clearing to the left first, and dealing with dead frogloks in a left-to-right fashion, since the Usurper will be to your right, and you have to place all 3 dead frogs before you get to him. You will want to clear the undead frogs, then find the truly dead frogs and place them on stone tables. These cadaverous frogs, and the locations of the tables that they need to be placed on are as follows:

<ul><li> /waypoint 29, -591, -239 gets placed on table at /waypoint -23, -58, -254</li>
<li>/waypoint 81, -62, -262 gets placed on table at  /waypoint 107, -63, -250</li>
<li>/waypoint 120, -64, -246 gets placed on table at  /waypoint 151, -63, -258 ) <b>BUT READ THE WARNING 2 PARAGRAPHS BELOW BEFORE PLACING THIS ONE!</b></li></ul>
<p>Placement points can be fussy. If the corpse doesn't burst into flame when you place it on top of the table, move it around a little until flames appear around it (no message, there are just the visual flames)</p>
<p><B>WARNING!</b> (Also known as "reading for the win") The Ghoul Usurper spawns as soon as the final frog is placed, beside the table at that final waypoint. I recommend heading to the back right corner as you enter that small nook, and placing the dead frog on the table while standing in that corner. That gives you room to target him as he spawns, so you can zap him the second he turns attackable. (There is a slight 1-second-ish delay after he spawns, before he goes aggro/attackable.)</p>
<p>Once he is zapped, a respawn point is unlocked for this little room, in case you die between here and the end.</p>
<p>Head to the gate at /way 125, -64, 287 -- it should have opened up as soon as you destroyed the Ghoul Usurper. Beware the roamer that paths right to the gate! Head from there, going either right OR left (they loop around and meet), to the final room. Clear the mobs, take out the named, get your reward and your 4th and final shiny for the instance and zone out!</p>

<p>Phew! Small wonder <b><a href="https://youtu.be/Ebc6hqeZXjY">the video walkthrough</b></a> is over 26 minutes long! I can do the run far more quickly than that, but explaining the various mechanics, pointing out static spawns, roaming spawns, etc. as I go definitely slows things down a lot!</p>

<hr></hr>

<h3>The Collection</h3>

<p>As mentioned, this is a 20-piece red shiny collection from this instance. (I believe it works like the PoP TS missions, meaning that you can see the collection shinies even if you don't have your solstice earring.) Each run through this mission spawns 4 fully tradeable red shinies ... or mostly fully tradeable. <b>The "rubicite nail" is no-trade, so you will need to actually be able to run the instance to finish the collection.</b> (And thus mules can't churn out extra books to sell if they aren't level 110 crafting mules  ;D)</p>

<p><table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:guk/gukcollection.jpg--></td></tr></table></p>

<p>At first, we only got the following teaser regarding the reward for the collection:

<p><table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:guk/gukrecipebook.jpg--></td><td><!--image:guk/gukrecipe.jpg--></td></tr></table></p>

<p>However, it has now been discovered on live servers and Test, so <b><a href="https://u.eq2wire.com/item/index/674351001">here is the EQ2U link to allllll the adornment goodness that is in that book</a></b>.</p>

<h4>Adornments, Fixed!</h4>
<p>As of August 14, 2018, the tradeskill adornments in that book will now work properly. Provided the patch goes smoothly, all level 110 crafters will be able to use the tradeskill adornments on any level of gear.</p>

<h3>The Achievement</h3>
<p>On your first completion of either the Guk tradeskill mission or one of the Guk adventuring missions, you complete the "Amok in Guk" achievement and are rewarded a no-trade painting, "Return to Guk".</p>

4 acorn Golden Acorn: Tree Within a Tree The quest giver is Oracle Ulinara in the Oracle Tower. At last check, it required that you be at least a level 20 adventurer.
<hr>
<b>Quest text:</b>
<p>
Oracle Ulinara says to you, "It appeared in the Karma Pool. While I was in trance I saw it. So... beautiful."
<p>
You say, "You saw what?"
<p>
Oracle Ulinara says to you, "I am sorry, but we have having a private meeting. This is no concern of yours."
<p>
You say, "Fine. I'll be on my way."
<p>
Oracle Ulinara says to you, "Wait! Please do not go. You... you may be of use to us. I want to find the tree and confirm its location. Unfortunately, I must remain here in the tower with my studies. Would you please help me?"
<p>
You say, "I suppose I could. Where should I look?"
<p>
Oracle Ulinara says to you, "When I peered into the Karma Pool, I saw a constellation of the stars that told me where the tree could be found. Go to the heart of a region called the Thundering Steppes, near the natives. You will seek a tree within a tree -- one dead and one alive. When you find it, take a Golden Acorn from its branches and return to me.'
<hr>
<b>Mini-Quest Journal</b> says: I must find the tree in the Thundering Steppes.
<p>
Travel to the Thundering Steppes. I suggest using the Steppes Station entrance - Its far safer than the other. Travel along the path. You'll notice the path turn to the left once. Pass it up. Another left turn is up ahead where the tower is. Take this turn, and travel past Bridge Keep.
<p>
Again, keep along the path once you are past the bridge. Once you see a tower, turn right into the open field, and follow the mountains on your right. You should pass through a small valley, and onto a bridge. Once past the bridge, you should see the dead trees, which look more like they've been axed by the local giants. Approach the lone living tree to get your quest update.
<p>
Location: Pos 594.94, Pos 17.21, Pos 427.22
<br>Orientation: Pos 315.97, 0, 0.
<p>
Quest Update: I need to give this Acorn to Ulinara.
<p>
Backtrack to Antonica and take the griffon to Oracle Tower. Or Recall to Qeynos and use the Qeynos Gate Griffon. Meet up with Oracle Ulinara.
<hr>
<b>Quest Text:</b>
<p>
Oracle Ulinara says to you, "It appeared in the Karma Pool. While I was in trance I saw it. So... Beautiful."
<p>
You say, "I found the tree and brought back a golden acorn like you asked."
<p>
Oracle Ulinara says to you, "Thank you so much. You have succeeded wonderfully. This is the very acorn from my vision; it is exactly what I saw. Will you please do one more thing for me? Will you please mark on this map the location of the tree? Then I will give you, in return, a recipe for making a magic food with the Golden Acorn"
<p>
You say, "The spot should be right here if I remember correctly."

98 adorndaily Adorning Daily Task <p>This task is available to adorners of all skill levels. If you do not already have the adorning skill, make sure to first speak with an adorning trainer (BBM docks, Kelethin, Steamfont) to learn adorning and also make sure you have purchased and scribed the special adorning reaction arts that are sold on the vendor next to the trainer.</p>
<p>The rewards for this quest are a city token, faction with your crafting society, and a few silver. You will not be fully repaid for fuel costs, but you should get several lovely adorning skillups without having to spend your precious adorning materials.  Since adorning was <i>not</i> known to be cheap to skill up, having to pay for fuel costs in return for skill up chances is considered a fair trade.</p>
<p>To pick up the quest, speak with Londiar in the main crafting area of your city (Ironforge Exchange in NQ, Coalition of Tradesfolke in WFP, etc.). He will give you a recipe book appropriate to your adorning skill level, plus the materials that you need (other than fuel) that you will need to make 11 combines.</p>
<p>Scribe the recipe book, make sure you have some coal of the proper tier, and go to the nearest workbench and begin crafting.  (If you are having problems finding the recipe in your book once you scribe it, filter on the word "guarding" in your recipe book.) You will have enough materials for 11 combines, even though Londiar only needs 10.  Finishing all 11 may eat more fuel, but it gives you another chance of a skillup.</p>
<p>When you are done, return to Londiar for your reward.</p>
<p>Unlike many "daily" tasks that reset automatically at the end of SOE's day, this task's timer notes when you handed in the finished quest, and won't give you another one for roughly 24 hours after completion. If you delete the quest, it remembers when you picked up the quest, and won't give you a new one for roughly 24 hours.  (The timer is somewhere between 18 and 24 hours. I cannot remember what I was told, and I have not had a chance to time it exactly.)</p>

<p>You will find Vanesta Leaftraveller in the Oasis of Marr area of Sinking Sands, around the corner from the docks.  (-1162, -212, -279). She seems rather unwell, throwing up all over the place, and so on. Offer to help her and you will obtain a copy of "Emergency Shelter for Dummies" with a recipe in it for a level 50 recipe, a "rough tent".  Whip up the tent with 3 succulent roots, 2 indium clusters, 2 sandalwood, and 6 lambent filaments, and get that poor gal under shelter! Head back to town to create it, or visit the crafting equipment at the Golden Scepter in Maj'Dul, then return to her.</p>
<p>Once you return with the tent, you realize she's really, really not looking well, and you check around with nearby traders and merchants for something to help her further.  Head over to the Croc Hunter Camp area of the beach, and buy a copy of Bert's Big Book of Health from a rather shady fellow there. Scribe the book to obtain 4 recipes.</p>

<p>If you've not caught on to the fact that you're going to be running in circles a bit, the fact that there are four recipes in the book might give you a clue as to what is in store for you here. It is important to note that you <b>cannot</b> shortcut and pre-make the items. You will need to wait until you are on the proper step before you craft the needed item. </p>

<p>Since Vanesta mentioned mushrooms, the first thing to try is a fungus potion. Time to head back to town and brew one up using a slimy conger eel and stuff. Bring it back to her, and have her drink it down. Urrrkkk ... well, that didn't work so well. {wince}</p>
<p>Perhaps she just needs a good strong energy drink to get her back on her feet? Back to town you go to brew some up with some nice, strong, Maj'Dul Coffee beans.  While pouring it down her throat does manage to revive her, she is quick to tell you that she felt better when she had the plague.</p>
<p>You're really grabbing at straws here, but since there was a plague remedy spell in the book, perhaps it is time to try that?  Run, craft, run, cast. I'm sure you can figure out the drill by now ... and you can likely guess that the result isn't going to be quite what you hoped for!</p>
<p>A savvy crafter could pretty much figure out that the next thing to try is going to be the acupuncture kit, right? I mean, you've tried everything else, surrounded her with animate fungi, given her the plague and so on. What harm can sticking needles in her be after all that, right?  Maybe the 4th time will be the charm? {duck}  Wellllll, not quite, as good old "Bert" turned out to be none other than Bertoxxulous, god of decay and disease.</p>
<p>She sends you off with an important lesson: "An artisan is only as good as the knowledge he invests into his craft. All the recipes in the world won't make you a master of your trade if you don't know and understand what you are making."</p>
<p>Duly chastised, you return to the Grandmaster with an edited version of a report of your actions, and receive your rewards.</p>

39 advservice Advanced ____ Service This is a sequel to the <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q24&menustr=060000000000">Tradesman Service quest</a>, and is offered by the same Grandmaster NPC's in city crafting societies as offered the first two quests in the series. (If you are totally unfamiliar with this quest series, you will need to start with <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q18&menustr=060000000000">"Journeyman Service"</a> and progress from there.) It is meant for level 40+ crafters.</p>

<p><b>Premise:</b> It seems the grandmasters have yet more surveyors out in the field checking on the quality of available materials, much like what you did with the briarwood for them during the Tradesman Service quest. Some of them may even be out in the field for days or weeks at a time, and they need some supplies crafted and delivered.</p>

<p>Be ready to craft some tier five items and then do some running around in the wilds. You will also want to make sure you have room in your bags for the 12 crafted items that you need to deliver (unless you're a provisioner, and then it is only 3). Reward will be your choice of a class-specific tier 5 advanced recipe book, crafting experience, achievement experience, and 750 faction with your city's crafting society.</p>
<p>Once you have finished crafting the required items, follow your quest journal on a delivery run.</p>
<p><b>"The first surveyor is to be found in the Ferrott, most likely based near the wizard spires."</b> Find Keevan near the spires in Feerrott, hand over some supplies and collect his report.</p>
<p><b>"The second surveyor is to be found in Everfrost, most likely near the pioneer camp to the north."</b> If you're a low level adventurer, pray Dreadwake isn't awake and go for a swim. On the plus side, if you die, you are revived right near your target. On the minus side, getting back to the docks may be creative. Find Fiderik Nalot, hand over another batch of supplies, pick up his report, and continue on your way.</p>
<p><b>"The third surveyor is located in Lavastorm, most likely checking mineral samples on the beach."</b> . Your delivery target is off to the right down the beach, fishing. Do pay attention. It has been a long time since Fire Toad (an aggresive level 46 Magma Worm) has been seen this far down the beach, but you never know. Deliver supplies to Thullekla Dy'xin and collect her report before heading back to the Grandmaster with the gathered reports.</p>

17 alchdust A bit of Fire, a bit of Ice This quest is available to level 70 alchemists. Completion of the quest will grant the alchemist recipes to convert the byproduct dusts that are obtained from the creation of Adept IIIs into the next-higher tier's dust. There is no adventuring requirement for this quest, though there will be some dangerous areas to travel through for the low-level adventuring alchemist.</p>
<p>Each recipe requires fuel as well as three of that tier's dust. Completion of a pristine combine will produce one of the next tier's dust as well as return one of the current tier's dust.  (Example: three tier 1 dusts, plus fuel, combine to make one T2 dust and one T1 dust, on a pristine combine.)</p>
<p>Speak with Alchemist Janicia located in the Fool's Gold in Rivervale to receive the quest. (Each of the requested items will be a ground spawn in the designated area.)</p>
<blockquote>You say, "Hail, Alchemist Janicia"</blockquote>
<blockquote>Alchemist Janicia says to you,"Greetings ____, I am glad to meet a fellow Alchemist out here!  I see from those chemical stains on your fingers that you must be a very experienced alchemist.  Would you have time to help me with this experiment?  I'll be happy to share the results of my research with you, I think it might be something not even you have seen before!"</blockquote>
<blockquote>You say to Alchemist Janicia, "You're working on some new type of alchemy? You have my attention, please do tell!"</blockquote>
<blockquote>Alchemist Janicia/a says to you,"Well, I've been working on this new theory, but I can't leave these experiments while I go out to get the components I still need.  In order to finish distilling these, I need some naturally occurring sources of heat and cold.  This is not something that I can trust a novice to handle, as you can imagine!  Would you mind collecting the samples for me?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>You say to Alchemist Janicia, "I would be honored to assist."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Alchemist Janicia/a says to you,"Oh, thank you!  Here's a list of what I need.  I've found in the past that these locations hold the best sources of the extreme temperatures I need.  I just need a small sample from each; once you have located them, bring them back and we'll see if my experiment works!"</blockquote>
<blockquote>You say to Alchemist Janicia, "I will return with the samples as soon I can."</blockquote>

<p><b>Find an ice crystal in Everfrost. I might find some ice crystals forming under the dock.</b><br>When you arrive in Everfrost run to the north end of the wooden dock and jump off the left side. Take a deep breath, dive down, and harvest the large ice crystal that is nestled against the dock support near -54, -30, 157.</p>

<p><b>Collect a frostfin scale in Everfrost. These will probably be found near the waterline. I'd better avoid the hungry sharks!</b><br> These are at the edge of the first iceberg to the north, when you are standing on the dock, around the area of -200, -21, 108.</p>

<p><b>Find a lava crystal in Lavastorm. I will probably be able to find some lava crystals somewhere on the beach.</b><br> This was easily found on the eastern end of the beach, and requires 1 mining skill to harvest.</p>

<p><b>Find a maga wormling scale in Lavastorm. I will probably be able to find some scales near the rocks where the magma wormlings bask on the hot beach.</b><br>This was easily found on the western end of the beach, and required 1 gathering skill to harvest.</p>


<p><b>Reward:</b> Alchemist Distillations, uncommon, weight 1, level 69 alchemist, recipe book.</p>
<p><b>Other notes for lower-level adventurers:</b> There is sometimes an aggressive, see invisible, heroic Fire Toad on the beach in Lavastorm. As long as you watch out for him, you should have no problem avoiding him, since what you need is to either end of the beach, and he stays in the main middle area of the beach. Everfrost, of course, has different perils, with lots of heroic sharks, as well as a chance of running into the Epic shark, Dreadwake.  Be sure of your locations, watch pathing carefully, and only dive in when you are sure the coast is clear. An otter totem or other form of enduring breath is a good idea.</p> 2007-08-22 11:51:37 2007-07-31 02:04:13 Niami Denmother 0 1 2010-09-27 03:33:04 Niami Denmother
141 AoMdaily AoM Daily/Weekly Tasks <p>This is part of the <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g543&menustr=115000000000">Altar of Malice Crafting/Housing preview</a>.  As with any expansion content, this means that there may be changes, tweaks, etc. for a while after the expansion launches.  I'll wander through and clean things up as I catch corrections, additions, etc.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the "Return To Refuge" quest in the <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g546&menustr=060000000000">AoM Crafting Quest Series</a></b>, daily quests with Skrit on the Isle of Refuge will unlock, as will weekly quests with Quartermaster Robbins at Castle Highhold.</p>
<p>I don't think I have all the dailies or weeklies noted yet, nor do I have the sequence sorted out, for what order these are offered in.  Eventually, we'll get all the information noted, but for now, here's some quick information on the ones that I scribbled down notes for.</p>

<h3>Dailies</h3>

<p>Each of these dailies will reward you with tradeskill xp, AA, 1 plat 40 gold 40 silver, +500 Far Seas Supply Division faction, and 5 Far Seas Trading Company tokens.  Dailies change at 11 p.m. PT.</p>

<h4>Fruitful Foraging (Saturday)</h4>

<p>Harvest 50 hylocereus fruit, Kith peppers and/or sulfur fruit to replenish the stores. You must harvest these from pygmy brambles nodes while on the quest.</p>

<h4>Sampling the Danger (Sunday)</h4>

<p>Help keep an eye on the magical corruption around the ruins of the tower by gathering 10 soil samples.  Yep, around the tower.  If you're a squishie, I recommend picking the most crowded version of Tranquil Sea available, in hopes that the mobs around the tower are being cleared out.</p>

<h4>Sour Tooth (Monday)</h4>
<p>Those pygmies sure love their pickles! Make up 5 more batches of pickles that can be used for trade.  You will need a total of 5 kith peppers, 5 leonid root, 10 hylocereus fruit and 25 effulgent candles.   You cannot mass produce for quest credit.</p>

<h4>Grim Running (Tuesday)</h4>
<p>Use a tinkered snare stun (provided) on one of the grimling runners out near the digsite. You'll see the ROI for him on his map.  (For the wide area across the bridge, he runs around the edge of the highlighted aggro.)   He's aggro, but they've toned down his aggro range a little, so you should be able to zap him without getting hit, if you place yourself in the right spot. Right-click him while he's stunned, and in addition to the quest update for Skrit, you <b?may</b> end up with a lovely Rallic Pack pattern! (Random chance to get the pack any time that you do this quest.)</p>
<p>You will examine the pattern to have it spit out the recipe, and the pattern stays in inventory (you need it for the combine). The level 100 artisan recipe is lore, no-trade, no-value, no-commission. The pack is 64 slots of loveliness, but is also lore and no-trade.  This means that you can make <b>one</b> pack. For yourself. You will not be able to make this for your alts, etc. The recipe requires the rallic pack pattern, 1 crystalline spiderling silk, 1 pristine leathery hide (AoM leather rare) and 15 effulgent filament.</p>

<h4>Legendary Pepper (Wednesday)</h4>
<p>Harvest 10 pepper from piperacea plants that will spawn in the area while you are on this quest.</p>

<h4>Salve Supplies (Thursday)</h4>
<p>You will need 5 dogwood shrubs from the area, in order to make 5 healing salve. You will need a total of 5 leonid roots, 10 handama leaf, and 25 effulgent candles. You cannot mass produce for quest credit.  Also remember that this harvestable can be used as a house item, so this is the day to grab extra if you need them.  (The dogwood should be harvestable during the entire day)</p>

<h4>Small Arms for Small Arms (Friday)</h4>
<p>Craft 5 pygmy daggers (there's a forge next to the mender in IoR).  You will need a total of 5 iodocus cluster, 5 cadmium ore, 10 larix lumber, and 25 effulgent coal.</p>

<h3>Weeklies</h3>
<p>Each of these weeklies will reward you with tradeskill xp, AA, 1 plat 40 gold 40 silver, +2000 Far Seas Supply Division faction, and 15 Far Seas Trading Company tokens.  The weekly tasks change on Wednesday night at 11 p.m. Pacific.</p>

<h4>Feeling Defensive</h4>
<p>Craft 10 improved barricades for the defenses.  You will need a total of 10 leonid root, 20 larix lumber, and 50 effulgent coal. When done, deliver the barricades to Armsmaster Ryan then return to Robbins.</p>

<h4>Blessed Healing</h4>
<p>Create 4 healing Poultice.  You will need a total of 4 tunarean trumpetleaf from the Blessed Knoll area, 4 leonid root, 8 handama leaf, and 20 effulgent candle. Combine on the chemistry table. Apply the poultices to the injured defenders lying on bedrolls near Ryan by clicking on them then return to Robbins.</p>

<h4>Weapon Crates Restock</h4>
<p>Craft 10 spare defenders swords. You will need a total of 10 iodocus cluster, 10 cadmium ore, 20 larix lumber, 50 effulgent coal. When done, deliver the weapons to Armsmaster Ryan then return to Robbins.</p>

<h4>Weapons with Benefits</h4>
<p>Craft 5 spiteweed brew.  This requires that you go out and harvest 5 young spiteweed, then return to craft the brew on a chemistry table. You will also need a total of 5 kith pepper, 10 hylocereus fruit, 25 effulgent coal.  Apply the brew to the weapons rack near Ryan, then return to Robbins for your reward.</p> 2017-05-16 03:43:37 2014-11-11 01:04:11 Niami Denmother 0 1 2017-06-02 10:52:26 Niami Denmother
134 ffstations Frostfell: Shiny Boxes All Do Hide <h3>This information is from Frostfell 2013 and is information that is only of use during the yearly Frostfell event in EQ2</h3>

<blockquote>Shiny boxes all do hide outside cities where mens reside</blockquote>

<p>With that quote from Ginneldarf Gigglegibber, the great chest hunt began.  (You may need to have the keys already in your possession before he will verbalize the clue, but you don't need him to tell you the clue if you're reading this article.)</p>

<p>What chest hunt, you ask?  Well, it seems that the above-mentioned Ginneldarf, the fuel vendor in the Frostfell crafting instance, sells three key recipes for 1p 20g each.  These recipes can only be scribed/crafted by level 90+ crafters, but they can be commissioned.  They must be crafted on the Frosftell workbench (which looks like a woodworking table) in the Frostfell Wonderland Village.  They are lore, no trade.</p>
<ul><li>A Cheery Key: 3 amethyst, 1 white peony tea leaf, 1 iridium cluster, 2 elven magic</li>
<li>A Festive Key: 3 iridium cluster, 1 swamp ash lumber, 1 amethyst, 2 holiday cheer</li>
<li>A Merry Key: 3 rhenium ore, 1 matoppie roots, 1 swamp ash lumber, 2 holiday spirit</li></ul>

<p>And what do those keys go to?  Three different chests that contain no-trade crafting stations that can go in your home or guildhall, that can handle Frostfell crafting combines year-round.</p>

<table align="center"><tr><td align="center">Merry Stove & Keg<br><!--image:frostfell/merry_stovekeg.jpg--></td>
<td align="center">Cheery Loom<br><!--image:frostfell/cheery_loom.jpg--></td>
<td align="center">Festive Workbench<br><!--image:frostfell/festive_workbench.jpg--></td>
</tr></table>

<ul><li>The chests can be seen by anyone, but you need a key to open them.</li>
<li>The key is consumed when you open the chest.</li>
<li>In order to get the key recipes, you will have to pick up the quest Frostfell Decorating Committee: Permafrost from Sogs Frostfoot inside the Frostfell Wonderland Village, then it will be a zone option off the Icy Keep door</li>
<li>Chest locations have been found in zones near home cities</li>
<li>We do not have spawn times yet, but it seems pretty quick once we know where to look</li>
<li>Chests can spawn in different locations in the same zone, and each station type can be found in two zones/</li>
<li>Chests have been found outside all major cities: Commonlands, Antonica, Darklight Woods, Frostfang Sea, Greater Faydark, and Timorous Deep</li>
<li>Key combines require common T10 mats</li>
<li><font color="red"><B>Key <i>recipes</i> are removed from your book as you loot the matching chest.  If you want another set of keys on that same character, you will have to place the stations in a home or hall, then buy and scribe new copies of the recipes.</b></font></li>
<li>You can use track harvestables on these (and gnomish divining rods).</li>
<li>The chests will <b>NOT</b> spawn once Frostfell is over, so if you don't grab them before then, you will be waiting another year for your permanent home Frostfell stations</li>
<li>The crafting stations themselves, however, once you claim them from the chests, will stick around permanently, and, once placed, can be used by anyone who has visitor access to the home/hall in which they are placed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The chest that you are looking for looks like the below, with the name being cheery, merry or festive, based on which key is needed.</p>
<table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:frostfell/merry_chest.jpg--></td></tr></table>
<p><b>Hint:</b> notice how "chest" has been typed into the bar near the top of the tracking window? That will make it so that the tracking window will only show the Frostfell chests, if there are any in sensing range. If the tracking window shows nothing while you are in the proper zone, keep the window open and wander around until one pops up on track.</p>

<p>Whether you took my recommendation to simply wait until <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q124&menustr=060000000000">The Captain's Lament</a> sent you to Obol Plains, or you decided to head up to Cardin Ward on your own, Vanesta Leaftraveler is standing in an open area in Cardin Ward.</p>

<table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:tov/vanesta_baelfang.jpg--></td></tr></table>


<blockquote>You say, "Hail, Vanesta Leaftraveler"</blockquote>
<blockquote>Vanesta Leaftraveler says to you, "Hello, you're a newcomer here."</blockquote>
<blockquote>You say to Vanesta Leaftraveler, "Yes, I am.  What is this place?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>Vanesta Leaftraveler says to you, "This is Ethernere, where the deceased await final judgement by their deity before they go to their final rest. And we are in the Loping Plains as your spirit perceives it: how it should be, or could be, or might be."</blockquote>
<blockquote>You say to Vanesta Leaftraveler, "Why are there so many people around then? Does it take a long time?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>Vanesta Leaftraveler says to you, "Now the gods have returned to Norrath, most spirits pass through quickly. But some, like me, choose to remain, so long as Drinal's Steward allows it.  We are known as the Wayward. But please excuse me for now, I need to finish this work. Why don't you speak to a few others if you want to know more."</blockquote>
<blockquote>You say to Vanesta Leaftraveler, "Thanks, I will."</blockquote>

<p>You'll find you now have three people to talk to, and your map should happily display them for you.</p>

<p>Baelfang is standing directly next to Vanesta. She will offer you <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q126&menustr=115000000000">"A Harrowing Tale"</a></b> after she gives you your quest update.</p>
<p>Catha is nearby, directing some of the defenders. She will offer you <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q127&menustr=115000000000">"The Essentials of Battle"</a></b> after she gives you your quest update.</p>
<p>Taldar is in the building with the stove and keg.  He will offer you <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q129&menustr=115000000000">"The Smell of Home"</a></b> after he gives you your quest update.</p>
<p>As soon as you have the quest updates, you can return to Vanesta for quest completion, a plat or so, and a bit of tradeskill/aa xp.</p>

<blockquote>Vanesta Leaftraveler says to you, "Hello again, I hope you're feeling less disoriented now?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>You say to Vanesta Leaftraveler, "I spoke to some of the others, thanks."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Vanesta Leaftraveler says to you, "You'll need to decide soon whether you are gong to stay here for a while, or move on to meet your deity's judgement. I saw the things you made for the defenders; if you do decide to stay, we could certainly use the help of a skilled crafter such as yourself."</blockquote>
<blockquote>You say to Vanesta Leaftraveler, "You talk as if it's a choice everyone can make, but one of the others said some people, like you, can't leave."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Vanesta Leaftraveler says to you, "The deity I worshipped is not yet returned. However, I was killed by the influence of another deity, Bertoxxulous. I have the option to be judged by him, but I definitely do not want to go there. So I stay here, and work to heal people and fight the influence of Bertoxxulous."</blockquote>
<blockquote>You say to Vanesta Leaftraveler, "Keep up the good work! Is there anything I can help with?"</blockquote>
<p><i>Killed by the influence of Bertoxx, and named Vanesta?  Does that ring any bells?  Yep, you, as a younger crafter who didn't always think of the consequences, sort of helped kill her in <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q40&menustr=060000000000">Advanced Journeyman Tasks</a></b>.

156 from1to100 Crafting From 1 to 100, Guide by Bardbear <p>Returning player Bardbear recently wrote the following guide.  (Any formatting errors are Mum's, as she hand-converted this over from a word document and grabbed appropriate links.)</p>
<hr> </hr>

<p>I came back to EQ in November of 2014 after a many year absence.  So much had changed, and I'm still learning and re-learning new mechanics.  I chose to focus on tradeskills to start, as I had had a tailor/monk at 80/80, the old cap, and I would use him to explore the new content as an adventurer and crafter.</p>

<p>I quickly got him to 100 tailoring, thanks to the wonderful guides at EQTraders, so I decided to try something bonkers: get eight other characters to 100 in each of the other eight crafting fields.  Here's the outline of how I did this.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> the vast majority of this was done solo and guildless, so this can be done by the unguilded or those in a very small guild that does not have amenities.</p>

<h3>Helpful things:</h3>

These are not required, but make the quests easier and general maintenance simpler.

<p>I cannot emphasize enough: <b><u>GET THE SALIRAPTOR</u></b> at level 30.  There are two quests in Butcherblock, at the camp above the docks, one for adventurers and one for crafters.  Neither is difficult and having the "jumpy" mount will make the rest of this journey so much easier.</p>
<p>A personal harvesting depot: if you don't have a guild, and you are trying to level more than one crafter, this is a god-send.  It can be expensive, and bank space can be used instead.</p>
<p>A crafter with the harvesting pony and/or harvesting goblin.  Neither is required, but both free up time that would be used for harvesting.</p>
<p>Hammer of Adept hands: once per (real world) week this item totally refills your crafter rest experience bonus.  Available as the 6 year veteran reward.  However, it is also available from loyalty rewards (under consumables, but it is not consumed when used) - it takes 10 loyalty tokens to purchase.  You get the loyalty quest once per day when you log in, it has a mix of adventurer, pvp, and tradeskill goals.  Completing any two of the goals rewards one token (two tokens if you are a subscriber).</p>

<p>I leveled up mainly through questing.  I generally only had to craft about 3 to 5 levels of writs before I transitioned to the next set of quests.  This saved raw materials and fuel prices, but I didn't earn as much status this way.</p>
<h3>Pre-specializing (tradeskill level 0 to 9)</h3>
0-9: followed the basic <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q19&menustr=060000000000">tutorial</a> in my starting city.

<p>NOTE: picking your area of interest at level 9 auto levels you to 10, so you can/should do that as soon as you hit level 9. :D</p>

<h3>Pick general area of interest (outfitter, craftsman, or scholar)</h3>
<p>10: start the <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q140&menustr=060000000000">Shipwrecked</a> quest line with Raffik (it can be started as soon as level 5, but you might as well finish the tutorial first)</p>
<p>15: Do the <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q95&menustr=060000000000">aiding/sabotaging Halas crafting line</a> in New Halas.  (This quest can be started as early as level 10) You may need to do a few writs (available starting at level 15) to get to level 19.</p>
<p>15: Journey to Qeynos (good) or Freeport (evil) to get your <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g486&menustr=040000000000">apprentice</a>.   The sooner you start working with him/her, the sooner you can unlock the recipes. This also can be done as soon as you hit level 10.<p>
<p>19: Pick your specialization with a tradeskill trainer of your alignment (doesn't have to be in your home city).  Doing this auto levels you to 20, so do it as soon as you hit level 19 to save grinding through the level! :D 
<h3>Specialization:</h3>
<p>20: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q140&menustr=060000000000">Raffik's</a> next quest</p>
<p>20: Start the first <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q96&menustr=060000000000">crafting quest line</a> in Butcherblock.</p>

<p>20: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q18&menustr=060000000000">Home city tradeskill quest</a>: starts with the Journeyman line.  One quest available every 10 levels from 20 to level 60.  NOTE: You don't have to do this in your home city, you can talk with the trainer in any city of your alignment.  I HATE Neriak, but I have a crafter there for faction, I did all my tradeskill questing out of Gorowyn - you still get faction with your home city tradeguild.</p>
<p>30: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q140&menustr=060000000000">Raffik</a></p>
<p>30: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q113&menustr=060000000000">Saliraptor quest</p>
<p>30: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q97&menustr=060000000000">Steamfont crafter quest</a> - Using your raptor lets you avoid a lot of agro in Steamfont, if your crafter is not also an adventurer.</p>
<p>30: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q24&menustr=060000000000">Home City tradeskill quest</a> - gathering the lumber in Enchanted lands is super easy, only a couple of agro wasps to watch for.  Gathering the lumber in Zek can be much more difficult, but using the in zone horse (left outside the fort) and riding to Refuge station, then backtracking to spirit lake you can find wood that may be safe to harvest, just have to watch for asps and the occasional orc patrol.  Alternately, you can use your raptor to ridge run: jump on one of the many stone ridges in the zone and follow them - it is agro free travel, as long as you land well.</p>
<p>40: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q140&menustr=060000000000">Raffik</a></p>
<p>40: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q60&menustr=060000000000">Sootfoot quest:</a>  Again, ridge running with the raptor makes this much easier.  Also, the December 2014 changes to harvesting mean you get the required forages MUCH faster.</p>
<p>40: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q39&menustr=060000000000">Home City trade skill quest</a>: Again, travel is so much easier with dock bells in almost every zone and Saliraptor for traveling in the zone.</p>
<p>50: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q140&menustr=060000000000">Raffik</a></p>
<p>50: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q9&menustr=060000000000">Mara quests</a>: the satchel is no longer a must have pack, there are cheap 40+ slot general purpose packs on the broker, if you are able to access the broker.  Also, the loyalty tokens can be used to purchase bags as well.  The charm is a nice item, and the quest experience is nice as well, so I did Mara on all 9 of my crafters.</p>
<p>50: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q40&menustr=060000000000">Home city tradeskill quest</a>: oh the pain you will inflict!  I always feel so bad after doing this quest.  Running around is required, as you can't premake the items.  I went back and forth from the NPC to the Sinking Sands docks (three jumps on the saliraptor) and then used the dock bell to Mara - fuel and all crafting stations are available on Mara.  Then use the bell back to Sinking Sands, and raptor hop back to the NPC.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> there is no quest source for the level 50 advanced books.  But, if you are an adventurer, you can grind faction with one of the three courts in Maj Dul and buy heirloom versions of all the 50 advanced books and recipes.</p>
<p>60: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q140&menustr=060000000000">Raffik</a></p>
<p>60: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q42&menustr=060000000000">Home City tradeskill quests</a>: I did this and immediately afterwards did the crafter glider mount quest - the transport to the other islands is right behind the froglock area on the first isle.</p>
<p>60: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q112&menustr=060000000000">Glider mount quest</a>:  same general zone as the 60 home city tradeskill quests, I do them together.  I personally find the gliding mount difficult to use, but I like the quest line and the experience is very nice - at least one level of crafting experience for doing the entire quest line.  I just kept my saliraptor until 85, when I could fly.</p>
<p>(65: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q10&menustr=060000000000">Sokokar</a>) - I wait till, 70, see below for why.</p>
<p>70: Kunark.  Wow, it gets a bit tougher here, but I ran 7 level 10 adventurers/level 70 crafters through here with only a few deaths (all harvesting and/or shiny related) total.</p>
<p>I wait till 70 to do the sokokar quest because you can save quite a bit of running around if you do these back to back.  Run through the sokokar quest as outlined in the link above. When you get to the step of going to Teren's Grasp you have two travel choices, you can run up one of the two ramps and dodge very agro yetis, or you can take the dock bell to the Enchanted Lands (or any other zone with wizard spires) and use the wizard spires to travel right to where you need to go for the final step of the sokokar quest. But wait!  Before you turn in the sokokar quest, hop up the stairs to the high set of buildings.  The quest giver for <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q20&menustr=060000000000">"New Lands, New Profits"</a> is right there.  Get his quest.  Then go back to the NPC for the sokokar quest and accept his teleport.  After your turn in the sokokar quest in Kunzar's Edge, hop over to the sokokar post and fly from there to the Fens of Nathsar post.  Walk till you get the explore goal for the first part of "New Lands..." then zone into the Fens.  I do it this way to save flight time - the trip from Kunzar's Edge to the Fens is much shorter than the trip from the Teren's Grasp to the Fens.
You don't actually need raw materials for this quest, it is all running around.  There is a map on EQTraders, but I found a path that works better for me:</p>
<table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:site/newlandstravel.jpg--></td></tr></table>

<p>Following the ridge from Sathir's Span eastward and stopping at the second and third stashes is much safer and easier.  Using the saliraptor makes it super-easy.  For the fourth cache, just cross the little bridge and follow the ridge on the over side of the river chasm back westward till you get to the Western pens, then hop for your life through the swamp till you get near the brute area.  From there, there are smaller ridges that you can hop till you get to the fourth cache.</p>

<p>75: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q21&menustr=060000000000">"High Risks, higher profits"</a> -  Same general thing, again the saliraptor makes travel safer/easier.</p> 
<p><b>NOTE on faction grinding:</b> 10 of the Bathezid crafting dailies will give enough faction to unlock the <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q27&menustr=060020000000">Earring of the Solstice questline</a>.  That is the slow cheap way.  One can grind writs, costing fuel and harvests, to do this much faster.  It comes down to what is more important: time or resources.</p>
<p>80: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q140&menustr=060000000000">Raffik</a></p>
<p>80: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q78&menustr=060000000000">Sentinel's Fate</a>:  Yet again, saliraptor makes travels much simpler.  To get to Sundered Frontier, using the spires, I prefer enchanted lands, since there is little to no agro between the docks and the spires there.  "Safe" harvesting areas: roots and shrubs near the druid portal, just have to keep an eye on a couple of cats.  Ores and dens: in the battleground area where the Ancient Hua Mein Spirit sends you - all the mobs are non-agro except a small group near the center of the battlefield. Fish: on Kerra Isle, in the Queen's area.  Wood: near the flight platform on Kerra Isle.  Totally safe to harvest there, also few rare spawns of roots in this area as well.</p>
<p>For the adventurous, when doing the Kerra quests, you can shave a bit of the travel time by jumping off the disk as it passes over Spire Isle, and using the teleporter there to get to Paineel for crafting.  Shaves about two minutes off the trip.</p>
<p>NOTE: if leveling more than one crafter, you only need to faction with one of them if desired - the faction recipes are heirloom and can be shared between alts on the same account.</p>
<p>85: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q87&menustr=060000000000">Shadows of the Betrayed</a> Since the reward is level 85, and there is a time delay for the quest starter email after completing the Quel'ule part of the Sundered Frontier questline, you'll likely be around level 85 when you tackle this anyway.  Note that for the step requiring the Emergency Portal Repair crafting instance from Mara, the quests are cycling every hour and a half now (not daily), so if the right Mara mission isn't being offered, decline and ask again later.</p>
<p>85: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q103&menustr=060000000000">Velious</a> - You can juggle some of the quests to save trips.  Like saving testing Boomba until you get Agni's quest to go the same area with a cannon.  For a non-subscriber, doing the gryphon quest is still a great way to get a flyer - and you need to do it to get your crystalline spiderling silks unlocked - but subscribers probably have enough loyalty tokens by this point to buy one of the 25 token flying disks.</p>

<p>90: <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q140&menustr=060000000000">Raffik</a></p>

<p>Frostfell crafting returned on the morning of December 10, 2009, and was available until January 7, 2009. These items can only be crafted on Frostfell crafting equipment, which means: 1) when the annual event is running each year,
 2) on April 1 when Bristlebane has them appear on the Sinking Sands dock, or 3) on <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q134&menustr=080000000000">home-based Frostfell crafting equipment</a>.</p>
<p>The three recipe books from last year are once again available, along with three new recipe books. (Returning books: Frostfell Feasts and Decorative Crafts, Frostfell Outfits You Can Make, Scholarlary Pursuits for a Festive Frostfell. New books:  Frostfell Feasts and Decorative Crafts II, Frostfell Outfits You Can Make II, Scholarlary Pursuits for a Festive Frostfell II.) Books are sold on several vendors within the instance, and can be scribed by a level 2 artisan. (The recipes themselves are all level 20 and 30, which can be done by low-level artisans, but not without a struggle.)  In addition, a few older craftables have been returned this year, by popular request.</p>
<p>Resources needed can be found on the harvestable present nodes in the instance, and require a 20 gathering skill. Frostfell fuel is sold on Gigglegibber merchants that are located at the two crafting areas in the instance.</p>

<p><b>Note that when performing Frostfell crafting, you have a chance for the rare Frostfell Innovation event to occur.  Successfully countering this will gain you a random Frostfell item.</b></p>

<p>The bucklers, like the ones from last year, can be either wall-mounted house items, or equippable bucklers (examine them to convert them from house item to wearable and back again). Equippable bucklers scale based on the level of the person examining them.  In addition to the above house items, this book also contains several articles of clothing. <i>(Images to follow later)</i>   blue starry Frostfell elf cap, festive peppermint robe, red starry Frostfell elf cap, snappy green bracers, snappy green gloves

<h3>Frostfell 2009 Nodes</h3>
These three present nodes, which can be found in the Frostfell Wonderland Village instance, require a 20+ gathering skill.  Harvesting tools that speed up the gathering skill are a good idea if you are going to do much harvesting here!  All items can be stored in the Frostfell Shopping Bags (available from the vendors in the instance, if you don't have any from last year), and 2 bags will be sufficient to hold everything.  (Frostfell harvestables will stack to 200, instead of 20, for Frostfell 2009.)  It should be noted that all but one of the resources are ones that were also available last year, which will make the packrats happy.

Mum always seemed to end up doing things at the last minute -- no matter how good her intentions were, there always seemed to be some distraction that pulled her away from what she was doing at a crucial moment, and by the time she was done with the distractions, "poof", in one braincell out another, she had totally forgotten about whatever it was that she'd been doing in the first place.

<p>Well, that wasn't going to happen this year, nosirreebob! She was going to get her Frostfell greeting cards out <i>early</i> for once!</p>
<p>Feeling very virtuous, she trudged towards the mailbox in South Qeynos with her stack of carefully-addressed greeting cards. As she dodged a pair of younglings pelting snowballs at each other, she started to mumble to herself about how the Frostfell decorations seemed to go up in the shops earlier and earlier every year.</p>
<p>"Och, listen tae me. I'm starting tae sound like one o' those grumpy grannies I used tae snicker about when I was a youngling.  Brasse is right.  We <b>are</b> getting auld!"  With a wry shake of her head, she vowed to try to "think young thoughts" and continued on her way.</p>
<p>Dodging a patch of ice on the sidewalk that hadn't been sanded yet, she turned the last street-corner before the Inn and the mailbox -- only to be almost bowled over by a pigtailed halfling lady running pell-mell while chanting "Frostyfell! Frostyfell!"</p>
<p>"Boola-lass!  Watch out frae th' ..." A squeal and a crash sounded from around the corner. "... ice."</p>
<p>Stuffing the cards back in her pack, she hurried to make sure that Boola hadn't broken anything ... this time. Thankfully, she had nothing more than a few bumps and scrapes, and was quickly off to run amok in the Frostfell Wonderland Village, with Niami following more slowly behind her.  After all, she really <i>should</i> see if there were any new recipe books, and if Santa Glug had any new gifts this years, right?</p>
<p>It wasn't until several hours later that she returned home, laden with Frostfell Shopping bags filled to the brim, that she realized she'd never mailed the greeting cards. "Ah well, I'm nae late wi' 'em ... yet!"</p>

<p><i>This is one of the new personalized greeting cards that can be crafted this year, that acts exactly like the player-made notebooks.</i></p>
<hr> </hr>

<p>Frostfell, EverQuest II's mid-winter holiday festival, is just around the corner, complete with daily gifts to claim, glowies to grab, quests to run, items to craft and gifts to harvest. <b>(Frostfell will run from the morning of December 10, 2009 to the morning of January 7, 2009)</b></p>
<p>Yep, I said gifts to harvest.</p>
<p>For those of you not familiar with the event, a magic closet will be available in the various cities (Qeynos Harbor near the clocktower, West Freeport across from the bank, Kelethin near Joleena's pub, at the bottom of the lifts in Gorowyn, and in the Foreign Quarter in Neriak) leading to a Frostfell Wonderland instance.  On top of containing several quests, Santa Glug (who will give you a random gift once every 24 hours), and purple glowies for a special collection, this instance contains harvestable present nodes bearing resources needed for Frostfell crafting.</p>
<p>While I'll go into more detail on the Frostfell crafting in a separate article (to make it easier to view as a furniture gallery), note that whatever character you have harvesting and crafting for Frostfell will need at least a 20 gathering skill, 2 bag slots for the harvestables, and empty bags for the items made. Recipes can be scribed at artisan level 2, but be aware that the recipes themselves are level 30 recipes. You can craft them at lower levels, but you'll be really struggling with the combines.  I'd personally recommend that if you're one of those who plan on using a dedicated Frostfell crafting mule, that you prep them in advance by getting them <i>at least</i> into the teens in a crafting profession via the crafting tutorial, and then rested back up to full vitality.</p>
<p>In past years, there have been <i>many</i> complaints in the SOE forums about Frostfell being too cheery for the evil folks, and many of the complaints did not abate after the dead Frostfell tree quest last year, etc. (Excuse me, it isn't dead, it is only sleeping!)   So, this year, you will find a few craftables have a rather macabre theme to them, suited for some of the more morbid folks. Mind you, this won't stop the complaints, it will just shift the complaints from one group of folks to another group of folks, proving, once again, that you can't please everyone, no matter what you do!  {grin}</p>
<p>While the 2008 Frostfell craftables that can be crafted again this year are in <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g293&menustr=080000000000">the Frostfell 2008 Image Gallery</a></b>, they have also been added to the bottom of the <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q69&menustr=080000000000">New Frostfell 2009 Craftables Gallery</a></b> as well.</p>


<table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:frostfell/frostfell_house.jpg--></td></tr></table>
<p>As mentioned above, Santa Glug is back again this year, giving you a gift once every 24 hours, if you hail him. Things like the sack of coal and shiny baubles are returning, and some new items, including glass baubles, have been added to his stockpile of prezzies.</p>

<h3>Icy Keep</h3>
The Icy Keep questline & instance also returns this year, with an additional heroic quest added after you complete the first two quests. This means that the vendor is also back again this year, selling not only the armor and weapons (offerings are scaled for level 20 and above adventurers) as well as house items from last year, but also several new house items!  (The bed, hands-down, has gotten the most excited responses from the folks on Test, followed closely by the table!)

133 frostfell2013 Frostfell 2013: Snowy Facelift <table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:frostfell/village.jpg--></td></tr></table>

<p>Niami Denmother loved Frostfell holidays, even though they wore her out terribly.  (She often needed a personal holiday after the holiday to recover.)  The sounds of music and laughter filling the air.  The delectable smells wafting out of homes as local cooks and bakers outdid themselves with aromatic creations. The general feelings of sharing and camaraderie.  The gifts both given and received. The lovely variety of foods and drinks. New festive items to craft.  Sumptuous feasts. (Of course, with a halfling, food had to be mentioned more than once!)</p>

<p>However, as she got older, there was one thing Mum truly disliked about the season.</p>

<p>The cold.</p>

<p>She just didn't tolerate the cold as well as she used to, and no matter how much she bundled up during the season, she always ended up freezing, with aching joints, when she finally made it home again after a day of festivities.</p>

<p>Of course, the cold made a good excuse to have a glass of mulled wine or spiced brandy, so it wasn't <i>all</i> bad.</p>

<p>Snagging a lovely new knitted woolen scarf, Mum added it to her layers of clothes before throwing a heavy cloak over the entire ensemble.  This was the only time of year when she didn't mind if the extra layers made her ample form appear almost as wide as it was tall.  She could barely move her arms in this get-up, but it was as warm as she could manage.</p>
<p>No scampering for her in this outfit, no sirree!  This was definitely more of a trudge along in slow motion sort of thing, which was probably just as well. If she fell on the ice in the Wonderland Village, it wouldn't hurt as much, especially with all that padding!</p>

<p>Eventually, she made her waddling way through Qeynos and entered the magic cabinet into Nar-, erm, the Frostfell Wonderland Village.  She narrowly avoided bumping into the legs of a tall barbarian who had stopped to simply stare around him in bemusement.</p>
<p>"Pssst, tallstuff, ye may want tae move a few steps afore ye gawk much. Ye're blocking th' way in an' out a bit."  Her merry blue eyes twinkled up at him from the depths of her hood as he shuffled a couple steps out of the way, but continued staring about him as if he'd never seen Frostfell before.</p>
<p>She valiantly refrained from making a comment about country cousins, took one step further into the wonderland ... and stopped dead, becoming a halfling-sized obstacle just inside the entrance.</p>
<p>"Blessed Bristlebane on a polka-dotted frost drake, wha' happened here?!" Mum moved reluctantly as someone exiting from the magic cabinet bumped into her from behind, barely noticing the curses or the pushing as she stared about in amazement.</p>
<p>In the land that only appeared once a year, where things barely ever changed, things had changed greatly.</p>
<p>It was breathtaking.</p>
<p>In some cases, however, it had literally taken the breath away from some of the inhabitants, turning them into popsicle-style icicles. (Peoplecicles?)</p>
<p>After finding an unfrozen Frosftell elf named Jingle wringing her tiny hands in dismay, Mum learned that she'd been late arriving, and thus had no clue what had happened to her fellow Frostfell residents.</p>
<p>Figuring out what happened could wait. Thawing out some of these poor souls would have to take precedence, and it seemed that while Jingle knew of some magic that could pull it off, she needed a few ingredients. With a bit of help (ok, with a LOT of help), the bundled-up halfling clambered onto her griffon and flew off in search of living burning embers and living ice crystals.</p>
<p>It didn't take long before Mum returned, and Jingle was able to quickly whip up a lasting thaw potion.  Like a fae-sized drill sargent, she soon had Mum and her griffon flying all over the area, thawing out specific targets.</p>

<table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:frostfell/iciclesnarf.jpg--></td><td><!--image:frostfell/thawedsnarf.jpg--></td></tr></table>

<p>However, once she'd thawed out Snarf and taken a good look at him, Mum almost wished that she hadn't thawed him out!  Then again, she'd not been too thrilled with having to thaw out stingy old McScroogle, either.  Still, it was the season for good deeds and she wouldn't want to deprive anyone else of their {ahem} stellar personalities.</p>
<p>Each one of them had a wildly different theory on who caused the transformation, based on what they'd seen and Mum wasn't sure if she wanted to laugh or bang her head against the nearest tree as the theories got more inventive.</p>
<p>"Pffft.  Miragul indeed!  Vox?  Pshaw!"</p>

<p>A bit more sleuthing, a bit more fighting, and Mum finally found the inadvertent culprit ... but that's a story for another time!  (Check out the new "A Deepice Mystery" quest for yourself for the full story of what happened to the Frostfell Wonderland Village!  I won't spoil it for you!) 

<hr></hr>

<p>Frostfell 2013 will run from 12/12/13 at 8am PST through 01/09/14 at 7am PST on the live servers.  Due to the very small testing window we had for this content, and the fact that I actually actively test such content instead of just grabbing my data and running, this preview is a lot more rushed than I'd like it, but it should cover the main points.</p>

<h3>New to Frostfell?</h3>

If you are new to Frostfell, welcome to EQ2's annual winter holiday event. There is lots to see and do during this festive season and you may want to check out <a href="http://eq2.zam.com/wiki/Frostfell">Zam's Frostfell guide</a> for information on all the adventuring-side goodness.  However, below, you'll find information on some of the crafting and house item goodies that you can look forward to, obtained mostly from within the Frostfell Wonderland Village.
<p>To get to the zone, look for a magic cabinet in any home city, and enter a magical, if chilly, land ...</p>
<table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:frostfell/magicdoor.jpg--></td></tr></table>

<h3>What's Changed?</h3>

<p>First and foremost, the Frostfell Wonderland Village instance has been totally revamped. Things have been moved around a bit, the ice is slipperier, the main rainbow bridge no longer exists (there's a ramp to your left), things just look stunningly better and those who have flight can fly in there now.  (The image at the very top of the page is from the area at the back of the new Frostfell Wonderland Village.  Shiny!)</p>

<p>Along with a shiny new facelift came a bit of a problem. It seems that a lot of the familiar Frostfell faces with whom you are used to questing have been frozen solid. Before you can do much questing other than the crafting instance (he's still unfrozen so crafters don't "have" to adventure if they don't want to), you will need to perform one relatively quick little intro quest.  (A few at-level mob kills, and some running around.)   After that it is Frostfell questing as usual.</p>

<p>As some added flavor, some of the citizens of Qeynos and Freeport who have been panicking about the dragons beseiging their cities, now have some additional phrases they will say regarding the dragons and Frostfell.</p>

<h3>New Craftables</h3>
<p>There are three new Frostfell recipe books - ?Frostfell Outfits You Can Make VI?, ?Frostfell Feasts and Decorative Crafts VI?, and ?Scholarly Pursuits for a Festive Frostfell VI? for sale on the Frostfell vendors. (Of course, the first five volumes of each of those three series of books will also be available for sale if you did not purchase them already.)</p>

<h4>Harvestables</h4>
<p>As with past years, three types of presents spawn in the Frostfell Wonderland Village.  Due to harvesting changes, there will be no minimum gathering skill needed to harvest these nodes for ingredients used in the Frostfell crafting recipes. The <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g521&menustr=115000000000">upgraded pack pony</a></b> can also be told to bring back holiday harvestables while the event is running.</p>
<p>The 55 harvestables used in Frostfell crafting this year are: black fabric dye, blue fabric dye, bolt of cotton, bourbon, brandywine, candy-striped staff pattern, cerulean gem of joy, chunk of wax, cotton twine, crusty bone, cup of cranberries, cured ham, everfrost icicle, fancy black wrap, fancy purple wrap, fancy red and white wrap, fancy red wrap, festive fabric, fresh celery, fresh eggs, frilly ribbon, frosted apple, frostfell candle mold, frostfell coloring, frostfell elf cap pattern, frostfell outfit pattern, frostfell snowdrift spell scroll, frostfell spice, frostfell stocking pattern, gigglegibber baking mix, gigglegibber sweet tooth, glittery powder, gold fabric dye, green fabric dye, handful of snips 'n snails, icy snowball, magical thread, malleable gold bar, malleable silver bar, molasses, onyx gem of joy, orange rind, parchment sheets, purple fabric dye, raw fowl, raw vanilla, red fabric dye, scarlet gem of joy, scented sandalwood, scrap of white fur, spark of goodwill, stretch of reindeer leather, sugar 'n spice mix, sweetened bread, unadorned silk.</p>

<h3>New Santa Goodies</h3>

<p>Just like in past years, each player can request a present from Santa Glug once every 18 hours.  Of the 15 tradeable gifts from him this year, seven of them are new.  Items in bold on the below list are new. </p>

<ul>

<h3>New Buyables</h3>

<p>There are three main types of vendors in the Frostfell Wonderland Village 1) "normal" Frostfell vendors (decorations, recipe books, fuel, some appearance gear), 2) the Icy Token Vendor (level 20+ adventuring gear, and various furniture items, mounts etc that require frozen token of e'ci currency), 3) and fuel vendors (located on each crafting island with Frostfell fuels and all the Frostfell recipe books).  Since we've already covered the new recipes that are found in the recipe books, let's take a fast look at some of the new items on the other two vendor types.</p>

<h4>Normal Frostfell Vendors</h4>

Giggawat and Garsleblat Gigglegibber have 3 new items, as well as 10 older quest rewards added to them this year.  (Former quest rewards: several glass baubles, cloaks and the Festive Gigglegibber Tapestry, if I am looking at this correctly.)  The new items are Festive Pine Garland, Festive Pine Swag and Vibrant Twinkling Frostfell Lights, which unlock for purchase after completing new Frostfell achievements.  Images are shown down in the Achievements section.


<h4>Icy Token Vendor</h4>

In addition to armor sets for the over-90 crowd, there are sevral new offerings on Gerbi Frostfoot, including the following:

<ul><li>Arctic Badger Ice Sculpture</li>
<li>Blizzard Grizzly Ice Sculpture</li>
<li>Rainbow Bridge (10 tokens per)</li>
<li>Wings of Frostfell Wrapping (300 tokens)</li>
<li>Wooly Silskpinner (housepet)
</ul>

<table align="center">
<tr><td align="center">Arctic Badger Ice Sculpture<br><!--image:frostfell/arcticbadgericesculpture.jpg--></td>
<td align="center">Blizzard Grizzly Ice Sculpture<br><!--image:frostfell/blizardgrizzlyicesculpture.jpg--></td>

<td align="center">Wings of Frostfell Wrapping<br><!--image:frostfell/vendor_wingsfrostfellwrapping.jpg--></td>
</tr></table>


<table align="center"><tr><td align="center"><!--image:frostfell/vendor_wingdetail.jpg--></td></tr></table>

<p>*Note: if you are standing below the rainbow bridge, you may find some odd placement surfaces. If you are standing on it (yes, it is solid), you can place things upon it with no problem</p>


<h3>New Quest Rewards</h3>
The following are new reward options for various Frostfell quests.  Since some of the quests are not repeatable, you will want to choose carefully.

<ul>
<li>A Deepice Mystery - Petamorph Wand: Frost Fae Drake, Frost Fae Drake Plushie</li>
<li>Saving Frostfell - Frozen Queen Bunny</li>
<li>The Giftgivers Dilemma - Frozen Gardy Ex-giftgiver</li>
<li>Frostfell Candy Grab - Frost Elk Antlers (appearance item)</li>
<li>Merry Mischief - Frozen Candice Cheriweth</li>
<li>A Frostfell Favor - Frozen Mr. McScroogle</li>
<li>The Tale of the Gigglegibber Grump - Dark Frostbite Goblin</li>
<li>"It's Time to Sleigh the Dragon" and "Covering Your Snow Tracks" - Frozen Snarf Frostfoot</li>
</ul>
<p>The Frozen Snarf Frostfoot house item was added to the Covering Your Snow Tracks quest at the end of the testing phase, since It's Time to Sleigh the Dragon is not repeatable.  Kaitheel wanted to be sure that those who had already done the quest still got a chance at this new quest reward.</p>

<h3>A Small Puzzle</h3>

There are three key recipes sold on the fuel vendor in the Frostfell crafting instance.  They are level 90 to scribe. The fuel vendor also gives a clue in spatial chat (possibly only to level 90+ crafters) as to the purpose of the keys.  These keys allow you to obtain Frostfell crafting stations that can be used year-round in your home or guild hall.  Since some folks tend to really, really want to figure such things out for themselves, the details on how to use the keys to get the crafting stations are on a separate page that contains spoilers:   <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q134&menustr=080000000000">Frostfell crafting stations for the home</a>

<h3>Last But Not Least - a New House!</h3>

<p>A new prestige home will be available from the marketplace during the Frostfell event.  Feel free to take a <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g534&menustr=080000000000">mini-tour of the Snowy Dwelling with Mum!</a></b></p>

<p>Merry Frostfell everyone!    ~Mum</p> 2013-12-15 02:13:21 2013-12-06 01:35:51 Niami Denmother 0 1 2014-05-18 04:39:17 Niami Denmother
144 Frostfell2014 Frostfell 2014: Candied Cubes? <p><table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:frostfell/banner_pinnacle.jpg--></td></tr></table></p>

<p>The air was crisp and cold, festive presents and garlands festooned the city, and laughter and snowballs flew with wild abandon -- Frostfell had arrived in Norrath amidst a snowy jangle of sleigh bells.</p>
<p>Niami DenMother was dearly hoping she could pull herself out of her midwinter slump with some Frostfell cheer, but so far, it wasn't working.</p>
<p>Things had started off nicely enough, with Santa Glug gifting her with a lovely new snowglobe, but then a troll roughly shouldered her out of the way, almost squishing her and her precious snowglobe, in his hurry to get his own gift.  Apparently, the incense burner wasn't to his liking, as he immediately started ranting and raving about it being the same as one he learned to craft the year before.</p>
<p>Mum eyed it, and him critically for a moment. "Pish. Th' one ye can make has cold snowflakes coming out o' it, an' this one has hot smoke. Besides, free gifts are free. If ye don't like it, ye can regift it or summat."</p>
<p>She rescued the incense burner from a snowbank after it had rather rudely bounced off her skull, and tried to find more Frostfell spirit.</p>
<p>A voice in the distance sent that aforementioned Frostfell spirit hiding before she could get a firm grip on it.</p>
<p>A flighty young wood elf skidded across the ice, nearly plowing into her. "Mum, I want to make the new gingerbreads, but I can't find a couple of the ingredients anywhere.  Hellllllppp!"</p>
<p>Deep breaths. It wasn't her fault that Bristlebane gave the lass less common sense and memory than a gnat.  Deep breaths.</p>
<p>"An' what did I tell ye last year aboot th' harvesting here, lass?"</p>
<p>"Ummmmm ... I can't remember.  Can't you just give me some sugar 'n spice mix, pleeeease?"</p>
<p>"I need my harvestables frae my own uses. I thought ye were going tae upgrade yuir pack pony during th' year so ye'd nae have such a crafting crisis on th' first day yet again."</p>
<p>"Oh, I forgot!  But you have your pony, so couldn't you just trade me something for some sugar 'n spice?  I only need a dozen!"</p>
<p>Mum held back a sigh with an effort.  "Nae. Now, listen carefully this time. Th' red boxes all by themselves are frae th' scholarly type recipes, th' ones wi' th' blue box on top are frae th' outfits an' loom-type stuff, an' th' ones wi' th' small red gift on top are frae the foodish-stuff, BUT ..." Mum waggled a finger, and the lass practically went cross-eyed following the movements of the finger. "Ye need tae harvest ALL o' th' presents, nae jus' the ones ye need right now.  Not only may ye need th' other stuff later, but if ye only harvest one or twa of th' present types, pretty soon all that's left is th' stuff ye don't want.  It is easier, an' more courteous tae yuir fellow crafters, tae harvest it all tae clear it frae respawn."</p>
<p>"Ok, harvest the ones with the red gifts on top. Got it!"</p>
<p>"Nae! That's nae what I sa-"  Too late, the wood elf was gone, skidding across the ice and knocking down two fae and a gnome  along the way.  "Och."
<p>Sure enough, ten minutes later, Mum found the self-same wood elf whining to an aerakyn about there only being blue presents left to harvest.  Hoping that she'd not been seen, Mum quietly backed away, found an icy lamppost, and thunked her head against it a couple times. "I mus' remember tae be charitable an' kind during th' Frostfell season. I mus' remember tae be charitable an' kind during th' Frostfell season."  She really tried to live that year-round, not just during Frostfell, but her patience was short at the moment, and she didn't want to ruin anyone else's holiday with a redheaded hissy fit.</p>
<p>Normally, she'd just harvest off the bad mood. With harvesting arguments heating up on several islands between the clear-cutters and the cherry-pickers, she needed somewhere less populated, though. The pinnacle where the great tree now resided sounded like just the thing, and the view from up there was spectacular as well.</p>
<p>Rather than fly directly to the top, she slowly worked her way up the spiraling ramp, harvesting every Frostfell present as she went.  As expected, the view from the top was phenomenal, so it took her a few minutes to realize that a frantic Frostfell elf was trying to get her attention.</p>
<p><table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:frostfell/r_fretishan.jpg--></td></tr></table></p>
<p>"Oh no, this is just ... terrible! Our candy cane surplus! It's been ... stolen!  By E'ci cubes!"</p>
<p>Mum had heard all sort of things attributed to cubes, but this was the first time she'd heard of them having a sweet tooth! "But ... how?"</p>
<p>She could swear the tiny elf's hands were going to fall off, she was wringing them that hard. "I don't know! It's like the essence of E'ci has gone mad! Just went and slurped all the candy canes up!"</p>
<p>Already, Niami could guess where this was heading, and sure enough, there was the inevitable request for help, and the half-expected twist.</p>
<p>"Oh, and watch out! Earlier I saw some Humbugs leaving gifts upon the ice. I'm not sure if they'll help or hinder you, so be sure to approach them with care."  As an added bonus, Mum was warned to hurry, before the frozen treats all melted.</p>
<p>It didn't take Mum long to realize that she was too old, and too cold, to go careening  across the ice on a time-senstive chase.  To be more specific, it took her two cubes, and two Hunbug gifts, before she decided to let younger and speedier folks chase after the miscreant cubes. It was, after all, only the "surplus" candy canes that had been stolen.</p>
<p>She had <i>almost</i> missed the first gift, as she slipped and slid in a sharp turn on the ice. But almost wasn't good enough, and she clipped the edge of the mostly brown-themed stack of gifts and found herself flung up into the air, with almost no ability to control her flight path or speed of descent.</p>
<p>Naturally, this caused her to land directly on top of one of the black and purple stacks of gifts, which slowed her ice skidding down even more. It was like skating through molasses.</p>
<p>"Bah, Humbugs." Humbugs were especially malicious anti-Frostfell arasai ... or something like that. She'd never asked for an official classification of them, as they were simply "trouble" in her mind, and the "gifts" that they'd left out to slow folks down were especially annoying.</p>
<p>She broke up several snowball fights with a shouted, "If ye young whippersnappers ha' that much energy tae spare, there's some renegade cubes stealing th' Frostfell canes.  Go get 'em afore th' candy's all gone!"</p>
<p>Satisfied that she'd done her part to help with the problem, by delegating, Mum decided it was time for some well-deserved shopping therapy in a last-ditch attempt to find her Frostfell spirit.</p>
<p>She was just gathering up her purchases when she overheard a conversation that made her pause.</p>
<p>"Cubes ate up the candy canes?  Does that make them sugar cubes? Can we eat them?"  While the thought of cooking with candy-sweetened cubes sounded appealing, she suspected it wouldn't be as simple a task as the first speaker thought.</p>
<p>"Cubes are friends, not food!"  Ohdear, she knew that voice, and that oft-spoken refrain.</p>
<p>"Of course they're food! Watch!" Mum turned around, just in time to see a froglok flick out his tongue and lick a passing cube. The cube, in turn, started slurping the froglok in in turn. "Mrmph!"</p>
<p>While the lady dark elf wearing the red Frostfell hat simply stood there, exclaiming, "See, cubes are friendly. It just wants to hug you!" Mum and another bystander worked to pull the froglok out of the cube's embrace.</p>
<p>Back and forth the eat vs. hug argument continued, while Mum and the human exchanged eyerolls. </p>
<p>Then Mum had an idea.</p>
<p>Beckoning the human to bend over, she whispered in his ear, and handed him one of the bags containing her new purchases.  While the back and forth between the froglok and the not-a-frostfell-elf continued, oblivious, he placed set his item down, while Mum stood directly behind the dark elf, holding an owlbear ice sculpture in front of her face.</p>
<p>"Ahem!"</p>
<p>At Mum's loud and insistent noise, the dark elf turned around and came face-to-claw with the rather menacing looking ice sculpture.</p>
<p>"Gah!" Backpedaling quickly in surprise, the dark elf backed right into the icy bouncer that had been placed on the ground.</p>
<p><i>FWOOOOOOOOOOOP!</i>  Up, up, up flew the dark elf. Then down, down, down. Down into the gentle embrace of a theiving cube, which promptly ejected the candy cane in favor of the struggling dark elf.  Several other cubes schlumphed and sklorped in that general direction as well, drawn by the struggle.</p>
<p>"As ye said, they jus' want tae hug ye!" Mum called out helpfully.</p>
<p>With that, Mum scampered off to check on the new Frostfell recipes, hoping there would be something that could be done with sweetened cubes.  Sadly, there were no cube recipes to be found, but she rather thought she'd found her Frostfell spirit when she later saw a cube sklorping around with a dark-elf sized Frostfell elf hat inside it.</p>

<p>Welcome to Frostfell 2014, the annual mid-winter holiday event in EverQuestII!  This event will run from 8 a.m. Pacific on December 11, 2014 through 7 a.m. Pacific on January 8, 2015. Whether you are a Frostfell Fanatic or a Humbug, you're likely to find something to enjoy this holiday season!</p>
<p>Magic closets to the Frostfell Wonderland Village will appear in every home city, transporting you to a rather icy and snowy wonderland. In addition to the Frostfell crafting instance, there are plenty of other returning quests for the avid Frostfeller, as well as one new quest - the race that's mentioned in the story above.  (While Mum and Mum's human aren't keen on this type of race, many will find it a fun challenge.)</p>
<p>As with past years, harvestable presents are scattered around the zone, with 55 different types of Frostfell-specific resource to be gathered. Several Gigglegibber vendors in the zone will sell you recipe books (3 new ones, plus all the ones from past years), shopping bags for the Frostfell harvestables if you need them, and special Frostfell fuels.  The recipes can only be crafted upon the special Frostfell equipment that can not only be found in the Frostfell Wonderland Village, but home versions of the station <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q134&menustr=080000000000">can also be quested</a></b>.
<p>If you're harvesting for your Frostfell crafting supplies, don't forget to use harvesting kits and the like to speed up your harvesting.  The <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g521&menustr=115000000000">upgraded pack pony</a> will also be a boon, as you can send him off after holiday harvests for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>Right about now, some of you are champing at the bit, though, wanting me to stop babbling, and start dishing out the Frostfell furniture love, so here we go!</p>

112 glidermount Crafter Glider Mount Quest Series This quest series requires that you be a level 60+ crafter. It begins in Tenebrous Tangle, at the Breeding Grounds, with Darga. The reward is a glider mount, as well as crafting xp, AAxp, coin and Far Seas Supply Division tokens (1 per quest, except for the final one, which rewards 6).
<p>A more fleshed-out quest writeup will be added later, but this will give you the basic details needed for this quest series that was added with the June 24, 2011 patch.</p>

<p>It will save you much time if you bring the following supplies along with you when you head out to do this quest:
<ul><li>14 hanging root</li>
<li>11 horned leather pelt</li>
<li>11 rough lumbered rosewood</li>
<li>6 flying fish</li>
</ul>

In addition, you will need the following fuels, that can be purchased off Chans Ellin in the treehouse above Captain Velgre
<ul>
<li>5 scintillating sandpaper</li>
<li>17 scintillating kindling</li>
<li>5 scintillating filament</li>
</ul>

Speak with Darga, who sends you over to Captain Velgre, standing at the base of a nearby treehouse.

<h3>Digging for Grubs</h3>
The drakes have been hunting the komodos whenever possible.  However, they also seem to love the grubs that are in the area.  Perhaps if you use some of those grubs as bait in traps, just outside the perimeter. Harvest grubs from 5 nearby porous rocks. (You should have a map ROI of the area where the rocks are found.) This will require that you have at least a 5 gathering skill.

<h3>Come and Get It</h3>
Craft those grubs into bait. If you have 5 hanging roots and 5 scintillating kindling on you, you can use the nearby cookpot, otherwise you will be traveling to get your supplies, then using a stove & keg somewhere.
<p>Once finished, you will be placing the bait in the traps that are found at 5 marked POIs on your map (all in that same area of the Breeding Grounds). Expect to do some aggro-dodging if you're on the squishy side as far as adventuring goes.

<h3>Warm On the Outside</h3>
Head up to speak with Shio - she is at the top of the treehouse, and you will find the ramp up right next to Captain Velgre.

<p>It seems the drake attacks have left a lot of orphaned eggs without parents to care for them.  Shio wants you to make five egg warmers to try to save some of them.  If you brought supplies with you, you can craft at the woodworking table that is also in the tree house with her.  (5 horned leather pelt, 10 rosewood, 5 scintillating sandpaper)</p>
<p>When you are finished, gather five wind komodo eggs. Again, you will find you have a map ROI for the area in which you can find them.

<h3>Warm On the Inside</h3>
The drakes are making the area unsafe for the adults to properly forage, and some are becoming malnourished and weak. Perhaps you can whip up some sort of food for them? Create six warm komodo meat (6 flying fish, 6 hanging root, 12 scintillating kindling at the cook pot down below, or at a stove and keg, and bring them to Shion.
<p>When she mentions that they allow her to hand-feed them, and you realize how docile they are, you begin to think that maybe they'd be suitable as mounts.  After a bit of conversation, Shion agrees it might be worth a try, but that she isn't sure she could make a saddle from the recipe that Captain Velgre gave her.</p>
<h3>Fruit of Your Labor</h3>
This is, of course, right up your alley as a skilled crafter.  You will need 6 horned leather, 3 hanging root, 1 rosewood, and the nearby sewing table & mannequin.
<p>They're so pleased with your work that they'd like you to have the very first wind komodo glider mount.</p>

<table align="center"><tr><td><!--image:misc/wind_komodo.jpg--></td></tr></table>

41 glowies Collections: Red Glowies <p>These collection quests were initially added with GU46, then additional collections have been added over time. There are a few special things to note before we go further:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to see the glowies, you must have completed the quest for the <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q27&menustr=060020000000">Earring of the Solstice</a>. This means that you must be level 80 in your primary tradeskill and have finished your crafting epic. (Tinkering and transmuting do not count, as they are secondary tradeskills.) <b> As of Feb. 22, 2011, you no longer have to actually have the earring equipped, you just have to have earned it.</b></li>
<li>The glowies are LORE. This means that they can be traded/sold, but that you can't stockpile them, and passing them to your alts can be creative.</li>
<li>Some of the actual rewards are NO TRADE, others are tradeable</li>
<li>Hand-ins award you with adventuring xp/AA.</li>
<li>Like blue glowies, if you harvest one and do <i>not</i> loot it (due to lore, etc.) it will depop after a bit, and then another red shiny will repop somewhere, giving you and others a chance at a different red glowie from it</li>
<li>Some of the items have special effects to them - see the Closer Look section below for more details.</li>
<li>If you are looking for info on the red shinies now in PoP tradeskill missions, you will <b><a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q428&menustr=060000000000">find the information here</a></b>.</li>
<li>As of June 12, 2018, the following collections can be completed on Fallen Gate. While other zones are physically available to us, apparently they are flagged for some other era of our progression. The ones you can obtain on FG are the ones from: Fens of Nathsar, Barren Sky, Enchanted Lands, Zek, Maj'Dul, New Halas and Steamfont.</li>

I'd go for something a bit more "in character" for him - A series of pictures of him harvesting in the real world. Qho in the garden, Qho in the forest, Qho leaning over a steak with a knife, etc. NORMAL false approved http://gypsylynx.eqtraders.com/index.php?/archives/10-EQ2-What-to-Do-With-Qho.html

1 I'm Back! 1248980162 A few months ago, all our websites hosted with Racknine went kablooey, and while the EQ and EQ2 ones were brought back rapidly, my personal blog was not so fortunate. Once the server was <em>finally</em> kickstarted (after goodness knows how many requests), Serendipity turned out to be pretty much toast. Adam has reinstalled the blog software (thanks hon!), and it will take me a bit to get all the plugins reset, the blog configured, etc.&nbsp; My energy levels are pretty low right now, and there are several things higher on the &quot;should do as energy permits&quot; list.&nbsp; I'll get to this in Auguest, really!&nbsp; :D<br /> 0 0 0 gypsylynx 1 false true 1249580008 false
2 Thank you, Meggie! 1250277824 <p>It wasn't a quiet passing, as such things go, but Nutmeg (&quot;Meggie&quot;) had never been what one would consider a quiet cat. The only time she was really quiet, was when she was sleeping, and she most definitely did <em>not</em> want to go into that long, endless sleep, regardless of how ready her body was for it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;I got Nutmeg as a kitten 18 years ago, while living in Syracuse, and she was always a bit off-center. Mostly black, with flecks and patches of orange and cream, she reminded me of a bowl of spices that had been only partially mixed together -- including a long dollop of cream running lopsidedly down her nose. She wasn't what one would consider a beautiful cat, but rather one full of lively personality.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;She was also extremely &quot;mouthy&quot;, and was pretty impartial about sharing her opinion with anyone and everyone, often at maximum volume. I used to joke that she averaged about 45 ypm (yowls per minute) whenever I had to drive her to the vet, and the vet's office could always tell which cat I was bringing in for a visit, by the noise (or lack thereof, in Natasha's case) coming from the carrier as soon as I walked in the door.</p> 
<p>During the last several months, I suspect she was actually going hard of hearing, on top of everything else. The poor old gal would sometimes &quot;shout&quot; at us, throwing her entire body into her chatter, as if, because she couldn't hear it properly, we wouldn't either, unless she yelled.</p> 
<p>As usually happens with any pet that has been a part of your life for any length of time, she wasn't just a pet, she was &quot;family&quot;. </p> 
<p>This is something I rarely took for granted once I was &quot;retired&quot; and not getting out of the house much anymore. Having pets to care for meant that, regardless of how horrid I felt on waking up, I actually got up and got moving while it was still &quot;morning&quot; out. If my conscience didn't get me out of bed on the worst mornings, then there was generally a cat in my face (or bouncing on my bladder, or licking my fingers, etc.) telling me it was time to get up, feed them, and attempt to become human.&nbsp; When the pain or exhaustion was bad enough, and I felt like napping, there was generally a cat napping with me ... just to make sure nothing other than them was going to disturb my sleep.&nbsp; (I swear, Meggie was watching pro wrestling with my hubby, Adam, on the sly, and then practicing various wrestling pins on me when I tried to nap, some days.)&nbsp; There were antics to make me laugh when I was feeling down, feline demands that got me up and moving, instead of sitting in my computer chair for too many hours on end.</p> 
<p>Of course, there was also a lot of noise, especially with Meggie. While I can be pretty noise-sensitive at times, her &quot;talk&quot;, and my habit of talking back to her had some unexpected benefits for me, and actually helped my headaches.&nbsp; Yep, you read that right.&nbsp; Who'd have thought that talking back to a cat would help decrease headaches, eh?&nbsp; ;)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Like most people, I clench my jaw when in pain, and since I am pretty much always in pain, you can guess what that does to my jaw (and my neck, and my skull, as all sorts of muscles follow suit and clench along with my jaw). Since most of my &quot;talking&quot; is via my fingers on the computer, as well as random chats with Adam when he's home, that leaves many hours each weekday where my jaw would be pretty much locked closed, other than for food, drink ... and chatting with the cats.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Trust me, my sisters gave me the nickname of &quot;motormouth&quot; when I was a kid, and Meggie seemed determined to make sure I didn't totally lose the gift for gab as an adult. She would play &quot;shark&quot; around my computer chair, talking up a storm, coaxing me into talking back (and into &quot;spanking&quot; her, and/or holding down a brush, pen, book, etc for her to rub against, etc.).</p> 
<p>So it was a very sad thing to see her get less chatty, less active, as her kidneys continued to fail.&nbsp; She still loved to chat if I sought her out in her resting place, but it was me seeking her out, instead of the other way around. It finally hit the point where the subcutaneous fluids and other tlc weren't enough, and her body stopped producing red blood cells as well. At best, extra measures at that point would have only prolonged her life by a few weeks, if we were lucky, while making her miserable with all the medicating, etc.</p> 
<p>A week ago today, I brought her into the vetrinarian's office for the last time. Her talking was muted, but still present and she nuzzled happily against her favorite brush as we waited for the vet, a man who had been seeing and treating her for the last 10 years, and well knew her personality and foibles.</p> 
<p>Her body was most definitely ready to give up, but her spirit turned stubborn once again. (She took after me in stubbornness at times!) The tranquilizer injection, meant to put her gently to sleep so she would feel no pain or panic during the lethal injection that was to follow, only made her more stubborn.&nbsp; During the 5 or so minutes that they left me alone with her while it was taking effect, she literally braced her paws on the table, fighting to stay awake and alert for those last few moments with me. It was heartbreaking, but so very typical of Nutmeg!</p> 
<p>Finally, however, she couldn't out-stubborn the effect of the sedative on her overtaxed body, and she drifted quietly to sleep, so that they could give her the final injection.</p> 
<p>I stayed with her until the very end, giving her gentle pets and brushes as I quietly thanked her for 18 years of companionship, love, and much loud &quot;conversation&quot;.</p> 
<p>Thank you, my &quot;grumpy granny&quot;, for those many long years.&nbsp; You will be missed, old gal.<br /></p> 0 0 0 gypsylynx 1 false true 1250277824 false
3 The Ongoing Savella Saga 1253121039 <p>For those who have been following me on facebook for a while, you may already know some of this. For those who are just catching up with me now, as I slowly get the blog reformatted and resurrected, here's a bit of a recap.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;I've been trying since mid-June to get a prescription for Savella, which became the third drug approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of fibromyalgia.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>This year has been the worst year yet on the pain front, and I'm starting to have to really struggle to avoid slipping into depression.&nbsp; I know I have a lot of things to be grateful for, and that I'm in far better shape on some fronts than many who suffer from fibro (including many friends and relatives), but as my pain levels continue to peak without respite, and my energy levels and motivation hit what seem to be all-time lows, it is getting harder and harder to keep my moods on anything remotely resembling an even keel.</p> 
<p>Naturally, the added weepiness and moodiness gets me irked at myself, as I remind myself that I am one of the &quot;lucky&quot; ones among the fibro community (no need for a fulltime job, no kids to care for, etc). Getting irked at myself, of course, triggers more moodiness, and ... you get the picture.</p> 
<p>Anyway, I've been stubborn for years about taking as few meds as possible and &quot;just dealing with the pain&quot;. That went right out the window this year, however, and I'm now taking darvocet daily, just to get through the day (and to get more than 4 hours of pain-filled restless sleep a night!)&nbsp; I need to at least <em>try</em> something to dig me out of this accelerating downward spiral. Even if it doesn't work anywhere near as well as hoped, or if I find I can't tolerate it (like my eldest sister, Annette), I will feel like I've made some progress in trying to get this illness back under control.&nbsp; (Attitude makes a huge difference when coping with chronic pain!)</p> 
<p>So, I contacted my doctor's office for a consultation in mid-June, and finally got in to see her in mid-July.&nbsp; I was better-informed about Savella than she was, since it had only been on the market for a couple months. I mentioned that, other than a slight chance to raise blood pressure, it was looking far more promising than the other 2 medications that had been approved.</p> 
<p>Oops.</p> 
<p>You see, my blood pressure is a tad high. Constant pain can elevate it. Mood can elevate it. When you get pain and mood in a nasty spiral, well, even on blood pressure meds, things get a bit high. So, she decided I needed to take a second dose of my bp meds each day for a month, while she went and did more research on Savella.</p> 
<p>Back I went to her office in August, after one rescheduling on the doctor's end, hot on the heels of losing Nutmeg.&nbsp; Yeah, not a happy blood pressure time.</p> 
<p>My bp was even higher than it had been the month before, even with doubling the dosage of my bp meds. Naturally, she was a bit unhappy about this, and said that, while she really liked what her research had turned up on Savella, she didn't want to start me on anything new until my blood pressure was under control.&nbsp; She started me on a new bp medicine (while continuing to double-dose on the old one) and scheduled another followup for September. She'd also wanted me on a diuretic, but the one she wanted to prescribe had sulfa in it, which is a no-go for me.</p> 
<p>September has been a tad busy for me with lots and lots of EQ2 upcoming content to test and write about for <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com">my site</a>.&nbsp; Busy, busy, busy, with my brain trying to leak out my ears due to the sheer volume of it all. Not the best time to try to cut down on my stress so my blood pressure is sane, but I was managing ok.</p> 
<p>One hour before my recheck appointment today, the dr's office called and rescheduled ... for the same day next week when the content in EQ2 that has been making me so busy is due to be published to the game servers, and I'm due to be running about in-game verifying last-minute changes and updating the site.</p> 
<p>Oh yeah, my blood pressure will be nice and low then.&nbsp; <em>{sarcasm}</em></p> 
<p>What's next?&nbsp; Another delay until October while she tries me on some different blood pressure med?&nbsp; November?</p> 
<p>The pain is getting worse as the months pass, which, I suspect, is counterbalancing any good that the bp meds may be doing for me.&nbsp; I can't see much hope of that changing at this rate.</p> 
<p>Meh.<br /></p>

4 Savella Update 1255116737 <p>I have now been on Savella for 2-1/2 weeks, and I've gone from &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; to downright &quot;happy&quot;. My mood is definitely better than it has been for months, and the pain, while still there, is lower than it has been since spring. There is still plenty of room for improvement, mind you, especially on the pain front, but every little bit helps when you're dealing with a chronic illness that saps your energy and mood as badly as fibromyalgia does.</p> 
<p>The blood pressure worries seem too be a non-issue, as my blood pressure is back in the normal range at long last. (This sort of helps prove that a chunk of my blood pressure issues are from the constant fibro pain.)&nbsp; 126/87 is the best I've seen for a while on the blood pressure front, and if I can keep it down, perhaps I can reduce the amount of blood pressure medication that I'm on.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;The difference in mood and energy is very visible. </p> 
<p>I regularly hit up the Alberston's deli for roast beast and meunster cheese. Often, I shamble through the store - eyes a bit glazed, possibly limping a tad if my hip is acting up, and so forth. Today, I practically bounced up to the counter, and was pleased to see one of the &quot;regular&quot; deli staff waiting to serve me. Somewhere in the depths of my often-fuzzy memory, I seemed to remember that his wife also suffers from fibro, and I was eager to share the recommendation. Sure enough, she suffers from lyme disease and fibro, so I suggested that she look into Savella.&nbsp; He commented on how much better I seemed, compared to my usual, and was not only glad to get the medication name, but also my doctor's name. (They're new enough to the area that she hasn't settled in with a good doctor for the fibro, and I'm pretty pleased with Dr. Shali.)</p> 
<p>Time will tell if this will continue to help, but after this many years of coping, it is so very nice to have hope once again.&nbsp; I'm calling my doctor right now to update her and ask for her to prescribe this for me for the long run!<br /></p> 0 0 0 gypsylynx 1 false true 1255117805 false
5 The sun is shining ... 1255304419 ... the hummingbirds are still lively at the feeders, and the family rose is still blooming up a storm.&nbsp; What a lovely day! 0 0 0 gypsylynx 1 false true 1255304419 false
6 Be Water Wise! 1257178772 <p>As &quot;winter&quot; approaches here in Southern California, we're still in a rather nasty drought. Mandatory water conservation is in effect here in Vista, which mostly involves what you can and cannot do with your yard and such.&nbsp; However, water conservation shouldn't end there for anyone living in a highly populated area, as more and more cities struggle simply for suitable drinking water for everyone, much less irrigation water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'd like to share one of my preferred ways to help, since it allows me to keep alive the much-loved family rose, even with reduced sprinkling throughout the week. It also capitalizes on the fact that I have hummingbird feeders to keep clean, if I don't want hummingbirds killed off by nasty bacteria.<br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;Rinse water.</p>
<p>Such a simple little thing, but something most of us take for granted.&nbsp; I now keep a large metal bowl in one kitchen sink, and rinse my hands, various dishes, etc into the bowl. As it fills, I dump the water from it into an easily-filled wide-mouthed pitcher, then dump the water onto the most needy of my outdoor plants and shrubs.&nbsp; Given how frequently I have to clean and refill hummingbird feeders during the week, this is saving many gallons of water a week.</p>
<p>The other one that I do is more &quot;work&quot;, but I try to be good about it. I keep another wide-mouthed pitcher (the wide-mouth makes it easier for filling, and easier means I am more likely to be good about doing it) in the shower.&nbsp; When I am waiting for the shower water to suitably warm up, I fill the pitcher with the running water. Dumping this out on the plants gets the water back into environment without it having to go through the costly and time-consuming sewage treatment plants, etc.&nbsp; Yes, it takes extra effort on my part, lugging it from the upstairs master bathroom to the outdoors, but, again, it can be a savings of several gallons of water a week, which makes it worth it in my book!<br /></p>
<p>For those wanting more water-saving tips, sites such as <a href="http://bewaterwise.com/">bewaterwise.com</a> are fabulous resources for helpful hints and tricks. (It also gives you a visual of how badly off we are for water as the years of droughts continue in the area.)</p>

<p>For those wondering how I am doing on the health front, the results from the Savella are still good.&nbsp; Yep, I'm still in pain. Yep, I still have flareups. In both cases, however, they are definitely lessened, which makes them more bearable. I may be able to do a bit more gentle exercise and the like, which should also help in the long run.</p>
<p>As an example of how much it helped, my father-in-law was just here visiting for a week, and in the space of 4 days, we went to both the San Diego Wild Animal Park and Birch Aquarium. That may not seem like a lot on the sightseeing side of things, but it is more than I had been able to pull off in a few years without ending up flat on my back afterwards for a day.&nbsp; Yayy for progress!<br /></p>

7 Hummingbird Therapy 1257381355 <p>Do you know how hard it is to stay in a &quot;blah&quot; mood, when you've got a tiny hummingbird perching on your finger?&nbsp; For me, the answer is &quot;impossible&quot;.</p>
<p>I may be fighting a losing battle with the flu, and feeling the worst, physically, that I have since starting on the Savella (bad enough that I canceled my chiropractor's appointment today, as I didn't feel up to driving, nor did I want to give them whatever it is that I have).&nbsp; I may want to just crawl under the covers and sleep for a week or two. I may even feel bad enough to go to bed right after dinner, instead of my normal midnight-ish.<br /></p>
<p> I just can't be too grumbly about how I feel, though, due to thumb-sized little bundles of jewel-bright feathers.</p>
<p>It has been cool enough now, that the hummingbird population in the area is lessened. Many of the birds have headed down to Mexico for a couple months of warmer weather, and after the temperatures on waking up a couple different m*rnings, no matter how warm it got later in the day, I can't say as I blame them!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Lessened&quot; however, is a relative term, and there were a dozen birds visible, and more that were audible, when I shambled out to refill the feeders just now. Although it means extra walking, when they're in that sort of a feeding frenzy, I bring the feeders in one-by-one, placing a filled one out before grabbing another of the three feeders to refill. It is a bit more reassuring to the territorial little flitterbidgets when all of the feeders don't disappear at once.</p>
<p>When I brought the third feeder back out, some of the little birds did not fly away as I approached, but perched at the other two feeders an arm's-length away, pigging out. This made it the perfect time to play human statue and see if I could get one to land on my finger.</p>
<p>The answer was a resounding yes, within about 15 seconds of me placing my finger in front of a feeding port on the nearest feeder. It wasn't that the other ports were all busy (they weren't), or that they'd been totally out of food and starving (one of the feeders still had nectar in it that I dumped out and replaced when I refilled the feeders), it was simply that he wanted to be at that specific spot.</p>
<p>He was glorious. A lovely metallic green back and wings, a cap and throat that looked black from some angles, and an absolutely gorgeous metallic fuschia from other angles. Bold as can be, perched on my finger while chugging away at the nectar.</p>
<p>He was soon replaced by a dainty little green female, then another male with the patchier neck plumage of a young adult.</p>
<p>I likely could have had more land, had my body been able to cope with standing statue-still for much longer, but even those brief little visitations were enough to brighten my mood.<br /></p> 0 0 0 gypsylynx 1 false true 1257381355 false
8 Shaken, Not Stirred! 1276576433 <p>Into every life, some quakes must fall ... at least for those of us living in Southern California!&nbsp; We're actually due for a lot of quakes in the coming year, apparently because of the bigger one back in April.</p>
<p>How many of us know what to do during a big earthquake, though?&nbsp; I'll be the first to admit that I was clueless until someone posted the following link a few months back, so I'd like to share the knowledge around as things start rattling a bit more around here.&nbsp; This comes from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): <a href="http://www.fema.gov/hazard/earthquake/eq_during.shtm" title="FEMA Quake Info">What to Do During an Earthquake</a>&nbsp; For those of you living in the SoCal area, the following site can also be a handy one to have bookmarked: <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsus/Maps/special/California_Nevada.php" title="SoCal Realtime Quake Map">California/Nevada Region Earthquakes</a><br /></p> 0 0 0 gypsylynx 1 false true 1276576433 false
9 I'm B-a-a-a-ck! 1279332290 <p>Those who know me from long ago remember one me, who used to be able to laugh and joke a lot. &quot;Bouncy&quot; was one word used a lot. &quot;Cute&quot; was another, though some who used it made it sound more like a curse than a compliment.&nbsp; :P<br /></p> 
<p>Those who met me after the fibromyalgia really started getting bad knew a quieter, moodier me, prone to &quot;wearing my shoulders as earrings&quot; as I'd hunch from the constant pain, etc.&nbsp; It got so bad that physically I became a virtual hermit, only really getting out of the house for the chiropractor, the grocery store and such.&nbsp; My 2005 Celica is not yet at the 5000 mile mark for mileage, if that gives you any ideas of how bad it had gotten!&nbsp; (Meanwhile, I've put wayyyyy more &quot;miles&quot; on my keyboard than most folks do, during that time, escaping to the distractions of online worlds as a form of pain-blocking.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Starting the Savella helped in the fall, but once I settled into a new baseline for the pain, and winter, such as it is, hit here, it was almost back to the same-old same-old. I'll candidly admit, after the fact, that I was getting close to being clinically depressed, due to so many years of constant, never-ending pain.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;I'm still in pain. There has been no miracle cure.&nbsp; There is, however, a new me.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Sort of.</p> 
<p>More like the old me, starting to return after over a decade of hibernation. The process will be a slow one, but the first steps were very noticeable.</p> 
<p>I started up gentle Hatha yoga 3 times a week, starting at the beginning of June. Last week, I went mall-crawling for the first time all year, then went back and got a body wave (perm) the next day. Next week, I get a professional hair coloring done, to more properly cover up the grey. </p> 
<p>And I'm doing it all with a huge smile on my face.&nbsp; I'm reclaiming the old me one gentle stretch at a time.</p> 
<p>The next several weeks are going to be busy, with EQ2's Tinkerfest, the SOE Block Party, the SOE Fan Faire in Vegas, etc., but please, folks, help nudge me about mid-August if I've not started up a blog series. There are many out there with whom I want to share several fibro-related notes that I learned the hard way regarding massage, chiropractic, yoga, and even some food sensitivities that may help my fibrofriends out.&nbsp; Old me or new me, I'm still prone to procrastinating and getting side-tracked, and if I'm getting enough nudges, I may get enough &quot;oomph&quot; to get them written for you!<br /></p> 0 0 0 gypsylynx 1 false true 1279332290 false
10 EQ2: What to Do With Qho? 1281408671 <p>Pretty much every online game has at least one non-player character (NPC) that folks just love to hate.</p>
<p>Mine, which happens to correspond with the opinion of many of the members of the EQ2 tradeskill community, is a little boy called Qho Augren.</p>
<p>It isn't that he's rude, or mean, or even very bratty. To be fair, I have to give him points for not worrying his parents by wandering off on his own to obtain all the harvesting samples that he wants.&nbsp; (Though the fact that he spends all his time in that one little pond, often totally submerged does make one wonder if his parents were aquatic creatures of some sort, as opposed to human!)</p>
<p>However, no matter how politely he asks, by the third time he has sent you out to harvest an ever-growing list of items for <a href="http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q43&amp;menustr=060000000000">A Gathering Obsession</a>, you're likely ready to scream at him. By the time you have found the last bit of meat needed from Rivervale, you may be tearing your hair out. When you finally earn your cloak, you may have pondered several wonderful means of murdering him.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;Annnnndd, if you're like a certain stubborn redhead, you have likely had to go through the entire questline, several times, and you now flinch every time someone mentions going out to find their &quot;Qho-ta&quot; for Qho.</p>
<p>We just love to hate him, and since he's just a little pixelated kid in an online game, our hate is a relatively safe and silly thing.</p>
<p> What does this have to do with asking about what to do with him?</p>
<p>&nbsp;SOE had some of their employees decorate game-themed Mighty Mugg characters for the 2010 SOE Fan Faire, to be sold in the silent auction.&nbsp; Emily &quot;Domino&quot; Taylor, crafting dev extraordinaire, not only did a wonderful job of creating Qho, but she <a href="http://tradeskill.blogspot.com/2010/08/mighty-mugg.html">blogged about the process</a>.</p>
<p>He's now sitting on my kitchen table, along with the receipt from the silent auction, as I ponder his fate.</p>
<p>Rijacki and I both thought of turning him into a voodoo doll if we won him. Calthine from Zam had several suggestions involving firearms. I've also considered just hanging him from a &quot;noose&quot; in my home office.</p>
<p>I'd really rather not damage the replica, especially given the work that went into him, so I'm open to suggestions that will show how many of us feel about Qho while still respecting the work that Emily put into the replica.&nbsp; Depending on where you're reading this, feel free to respond on <a href="http://gypsylynx.eqtraders/com">my personal blog</a>, on facebook, or <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq2/showthread.php?t=8476" title="eq2.eqtraders.com forums">on my forums</a> with your suggestions for the little brat.&nbsp; :D<br /></p>
