1 God and Adam One day God came to Adam to pass on some news. 'I've got some good news and some bad news', God said.  <BR><BR> Adam looked at God and said, 'Well, give me the good news first.'  <BR><BR> Smiling, God explained, 'I've got two new organs for you. One is called a brain. It will allow you to be very intelligent, create new things, and have intelligent conversations with Eve.  <BR><BR> The other organ I have for you is called a penis. It will allow you to reproduce your now intelligent life form and populate this planet. Eve will be very happy that you now have this organ to give her children.'  <BR><BR> Adam, very excited, exclaimed, 'These are great gifts you have given to me. What could possibly be bad news after such great tidings?'  <BR><BR> God looked upon Adam and said with great sorrow, 'The bad news is that I only gave you enough blood to operate one of these organs at a time.'   <BR><BR>
2 First Aid 'How come you're late?' asks the bartender as the blonde waitress walks in the door.  <BR><BR> 'It was awful,' she explains. 'I was walking down Elm street and there was this terrible accident. A man was lying in the middle of the street. He'd been thrown from his car. His leg was broken, his skull was fractured, and there was blood everywhere. Thank God I took that first-aid course and all my training came back to me in a minute.'  <BR><BR> 'What did you do?' asks the bartender.  <BR><BR> 'I sat down and put my head between my knees to keep from fainting!'   <BR><BR>
3 The Cemetery Plot One year, a particular harried husband decided to buy his mother-in-law a cemetery plot as a Christmas gift.<BR><BR> The next year, he didn't buy her a gift.<BR><BR> When she asked him why, he replied, "Well, you still haven't used the gift I bought you last year!"<BR><BR>
4 Santa's Angel It was supposed to be a happy time, but it wasn't. Santa was really pissed. It was Christmas eve and NOTHING was going right. Mrs. Claus had burned all the Christmas cookies. The Elves were bitching about not getting paid for the overtime they had put in while making toys, and the reindeer had been drinking all afternoon and were dead drunk. They had taken the sleigh out for a spin earlier in the day and crashed it into a tree, breaking off one of the runners.<BR><BR>Santa was beside himself with anger. "I CAN'T believe it! I've got to deliver millions of presents all over the world in just a few hours from now and all my reindeer are drunk, my Elves are on strike and I don't even have a Christmas tree! I sent that stupid Little Angel out HOURS ago to find a tree and she isn't even back yet! What am I going to do?"<BR><BR>Just then the Little Angel opened the front door and stepped in from the snowy night, dragging a Christmas tree. She says, "Yo, Santa, where do you want me to stick the Christmas Tree this year??"<BR><BR>And thus the tradition of Angels perched atop Christmas trees came to pass...
5 2000 Survival Guide for Taking a Dump at Work Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure.  <BR><BR> ESCAPEE<BR> Definition: A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic/embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you are standing next to the farter at the urinal, pretend that you did not hear it. No one likes an escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.  <BR><BR> JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee)<BR> Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine guns pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen do not panic, remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.  <BR><BR> COURTESY FLUSH<BR> Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.  <BR><BR> WALK OF SHAME<BR> Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just stunk-up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of a COURTESY FLUSH.  <BR><BR> OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER<BR> Definition: A colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it. You will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look around the office for the Out of the Closet pooper before entering the bathroom.  <BR><BR> THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN)<BR> Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS.  <BR><BR> SAFE HAVEN<BR> Definition: A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.  <BR><BR> TURD BURGLAR<BR> Definition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD BURGLAR leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.  <BR><BR> CAMO-COUGH<BR> Definition: A phony cough which alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS. Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE.  <BR><BR> ASTAIRE<BR> Definition: A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential TURD BURGLARS that you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied. If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.  <BR><BR> WATERMELON<BR> Definition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a WATERMELON coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.  <BR><BR> HAVANA OMELET<BR> Definition: A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee. Try using a CAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE.  <BR><BR> UNCLE TED<BR> Definition: A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.  <BR><BR> FLY BY<BR> Definition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in, check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER. People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.  <BR><BR> CRACK WHORE<BR> Definition: A crapper that has seen more ass than a Greyhound Bus. Tell tale signs of a CRACK WHORE include pubes, pee stains and poop streaks. Avoid a CRACK WHORES at all cost. Try finding out when the janitor cleans each particular bathroom. Don't forget with a good cleaning, a CRACK WHORE can become a SAFE HAVEN.
6 Coming home late Two married buddies are out drinking one night when one turns to the other and says, 'You know, I don't know what else to do. Whenever I go home after we've been out drinking, I turn the headlights off before I get to the driveway. I shut off the engine and coast into the garage. I take my shoes off before I go into the house, I sneak up the stairs, I get undressed in the bathroom. I ease into bed and my wife STILL wakes up and yells at me for staying out so late!'  <BR><BR> His buddy looks at him and says, 'Well, you're obviously taking the wrong approach. I screech into the driveway, slam the door, storm up the steps, throw my shoes into the closet, jump into bed, rub my hands on my wife's ass and say, 'How about a blowjob?' ....and she's always sound asleep.'<BR><BR>

91 Social Security An old man went into the Social Security Office and filled out an application.<BR>
<BR>
He was too old to have a birth certificate, so he was asked to prove his age.  He opened his shirt and showed them the gray hair on his chest. They accepted that as proof, and give him his first check.<BR>
<BR>
He went home to his wife, showed her the check, and explained to her what had happened.<BR>
<BR>
She replied, "Well get back down there, pull down your pants, and see if you can also get disability!"
92 "The Catholic Parrots" A lady approaches her priest and tells him, " Father, I have a problem. I have two female talking parrots, but they only know how to say one thing."<BR>
<BR>
What do they say?" the priest inquired.  " They only know how to say,'Hi,we're prostitutes.  'Want to have some fun?"<BR>
<BR>
That's terrible!" the priest exclaimed, " but I have a solution to your problem. Bring your two female parrots over to my house and I will put them with my two male talking parrots whom I taught to pray and read the bible. My parrots will teach your parrots to stop saying that terrible phrase, and your female parrots will learn to praise and worship."<BR>
<BR>
"Thank you!" the woman responded.<BR>
<BR>
The next day, the woman brings her two female talking parrots to the priest's house.  His two male talking parrots are holding rosary beads and praying in their cage.  The lady puts her two female parrots in with the two male parrots and the female parrots say," Hi, we're prostitutes, want to have some fun?"<BR>
<BR>
One male parrot looks over at the other male parrot and exclaims, "Put the beads away; Our prayers have been answered."
93 Lipstick on the Bathroom Mirror A principal of a small middle school had a problem with a few of the older girls starting to use lipstick.  When applying it in the bathroom, they would then press their lips to the mirror and leave lip prints.<BR>
<BR>
Before it got out of hand, he thought of a way to stop it. He gathered all the girls together that wore lipstick and told them he wanted to meet with them in the ladies room at 2pm.  They gathered at 2pm and found the principal and the school custodian waiting for them.<BR>
<BR>
The principal explained that it was becoming a problem for the custodian to clean the mirror every night.  He said he felt the ladies did not fully understand just how much of a problem it was, and he wanted them to witness just how hard it was to clean. <BR>
<BR>
The custodian then demonstrated.  He took a brush on a long handle out of a box.  He then dipped the brush in the nearest toilet, moved to the mirror and scrubbed the lipstick stains.<BR>
<BR>
And that was the very last day that the girls pressed their lips on the mirror!
94 Shopping in Paris Two sisters spent two weeks in Paris. The locals obviously hated Americans - no matter where they went, they were subject to rude behavior from waiters, store clerks, pedestrians, etc. After a while it started to irritate them.<BR>
 <BR>
One day, in Paris, one sister went shopping. She entered a store and started looking around. She was the only customer in the store. As she was looking through the clothes on the rack, a clerk hurriedly approached her and very abruptly asked if he could help her.<BR>
 <BR>
The sister was used to this bad treatment by now and she politely declined his help. She continued to look at the clothes. Then she noticed that every clerk in the store was staring at her.<BR>
 <BR>
Defiantly, she continued to look through the clothes. When she could take this treatment no longer, she turned on her heels, with her head held high, and left the shop.<BR>
 <BR>
As she left, she noticed that the sign on the store read "DryCleaners".
95 Wild Nymphomaniac in my Car A guy sees his buddy in a bar and says, "You're not going to believe this, but I've got a wild nymphomaniac in my car out in the parking lot. She's wearing me out! Can you go out to the car and keep her busy? The dome light is off, so she won't know you're not me!"  His friend agrees and goes out to his car.<BR>
<BR>
They climb into the back seat and start going at it. A few minutes later, a cop sees them and starts banging on the window, shining his flashlight inside. <BR>
<BR>
"What the hell do you two think you're doing?" The guy says, "Oh, there's nothing wrong, she's my wife." The cop says, "Oh, sorry, I didn't know." <BR>
<BR>
The guy says "Neither did I until you shined that light in here."
96 Route 22 A State Police officer observed a car puttering along the highway at 22 mph. He turned on his lights and pulled the car over. Approaching the vehicle, he noticed that it contained five old ladies - two in the front seat and three in the back - wide-eyed and white as ghosts. The driver, obviously confused, said, "Officer, I don't understand. I was doing exactly the speed limit. What's the problem?" "Ma'am," the officer replied, "You weren't speeding, but you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers." "Slower than the speed limit? I'm following the posted speed exactly!" The officer, trying to contain a chuckle, explained that "22" was the route number, not the speed limit. Embarrassed, the woman smiled and thanked him for pointing out her error. Before letting her go, the officer asked, "Is everyone in this<BR>
car okay? These women seem awfully shaken and they haven't muttered a single peep this whole time." "Oh, they'll be alright in a minute, officer. We just got off Route 119."
97 Little Johnny at the Zoo Little Johnny wanted to go to the zoo and pestered his parents for days. Finally his mother talked his reluctant father into taking him.<BR>
 <BR>
When the day came, Little Johnny and his daddy got in the car and headed for the zoo. They were gone most of the day, and as the sun was setting, they arrived home.<BR>
 <BR>
"So how was it?" his mother asked Little Johnny.<BR>
 <BR>
"Great!" Little Johnny replied.<BR>
 <BR>
"Did you and your father have a good time?" asked his mother.<BR>
 <BR>
"Yeah, Daddy really liked it a lot," exclaimed Little Johnny excitedly, "especially when one of the animals came racing home at 30 to 1!"

100 Dark in Here A woman takes a lover during the day while her husband is at work. Her 9-year-old son comes home unexpectedly so she puts him in the closet and shuts the door. <BR>
<BR>
Her husband also comes home early, so she puts her lover in the closet with the little boy. <BR>
<BR>
The little boy says, "Dark in here." <BR>
The man says, "Yes, it is." <BR>
Boy: "I have a baseball." <BR>
Man: "That's nice." <BR>
Boy: "want to buy it?" <BR>
Man: "No, thanks." <BR>
Boy: "My dad's outside." <BR>
Man: "OK, how much?" <BR>
Boy: "25 dollars." <BR>
Man: "Fine". <BR>
<BR>
In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the lover are <BR>
In the closet together. <BR>
<BR>
Boy: "Dark in here." <BR>
Man: "Yes, it is." <BR>
Boy: "I have a baseball mitt." <BR>
Remembering the last time, he asks, "how much?" <BR>
Boy: "75 dollars." <BR>
Man: "Fine." <BR>
<BR>
A few days later, the boy's father says to the boy, "Grab your glove. <BR>
Let's go outside and toss the baseball back and forth." <BR>
The boy says, "I can't. I sold them." <BR>
Father: "How much did you sell them for?" <BR>
Boy: "100 dollars." <BR>
<BR>
The father says, "That's terrible to overcharge your friends like that, 100 dollars is way more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you confess." <BR>
<BR>
They go to church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and he closes the door. <BR>
<BR>
The boy says, "Dark in here." <BR>
<BR>
The Priest says, "Don't start that shit again!"

1 1 2018-01-20 20:19:58 2018-01-20 20:19:58 Welcome to WordPress. This is your first post. Edit or delete it, then start writing! Hello world! publish open open hello-world 2018-01-20 20:19:58 2018-01-20 20:19:58 0 http://blog.corrinaryanphotography.com/?p=1 0 post 1
2 1 2018-01-20 20:19:58 2018-01-20 20:19:58 This is an example page. It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:

<blockquote>Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>

...or something like this:

<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>
