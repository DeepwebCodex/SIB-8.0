879 30 trip456f3dac3639c www.physorg.com Marijuana may affect neuron firing The new-found effect of THC at hippocampal sites may point to underlying cause of marijuana's memory impairment U.S. scientists have discovered the active ingredient in marijuana interferes with synchronized activity between neurons in the hippocampus of rats.

The authors suggest action of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, might explain why marijuana impairs memory.

Gyorgy Buzsaki and colleagues at Rutgers University recorded the activity of multiple neurons in the hippocampus of rats. Normally neurons in that region form groups that fire action potentials, or nerve impulses, together at about 4-10 times per second. But when the authors injected THC, or a related synthetic drug, into the hippocampus, that synchrony was disrupted.

The researchers said the drugs did not change the total number of action potentials produced, just their tendency to occur at the same time. Animals with less synchronized neural activity under the drug performed less well in a standard test of memory, suggesting synchronized neural firing is important for normal hippocampal function.

The study appears in the December issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience. http://www.physorg.com/news84048508.html News Drugs 2 22 0 0 marijuana brain memory 0 1 tripzine 2006-11-30 14:23:08 30 0 www.tripzine.com 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 41 2010-05-05 15:28:34
878 30 trip456f3d22e578a media.www.dukechronicle.com Duke drug culture examined Interesting article taking an honest look at undergrad drug culture at Duke University Before Mike came to Duke, he was a typical high-achieving student.

Like many of his high school classmates, he drank on occasion but had tried little else.

By his sophomore year at Duke, Mike had experimented with cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, Viagra and Cialis. And he was smoking marijuana nearly every day.

"We tried to make each night as fun as possible," said Mike, reflecting on the behavior of his friends from freshman and sophomore year.

Now a junior, Mike said that, in retrospect, the lifestyle took a toll on their academics. http://media.www.dukechronicle.com/media/storage/paper884/news/2006/11/30/News/Highs.Lows.Mark.Duke.Drug.Culture-2515082.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dukechronicle.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com News Drugs 2 22 0 0 Duke drugs marijuana 0 1 tripzine 2006-11-30 14:20:50 30 0 www.tripzine.com 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 43 2010-01-20 11:58:36
877 30 trip456dc98e637cb www.ksl.com Utah lawmaker moves to ban salvia TV news scare report on Salvia divinorum prompts lawmaker to act An immediate response to last night's Eyewitness News Investigation into the herb called Salvia. Just hours after we warned you about the legal but dangerous substance, a Utah lawmaker took some action.

Utah Lawmaker Paul Ray watched our story on Salvia divinorum. He didn't like what he saw.

"I am rocking the world right now. I just feel like I am rocking the world."

Only KSL brought you the video of kids tripping out on the legal herb, Salvia -- a substance narcotics officers compare to LSD.

"Like I've stepped outside my body."

We went undercover to show you how easy it is to buy the hallucinogen at Salt Lake Valley smoke shops. Our story revealed that while Utah teens know all about smoking Salvia to get high, parents are in the dark.

"Never knew anything about this. Never heard of this."

Rep. Paul Ray, (R) Clearfield: "It was upsetting to see we have a drug of that strength that's legal."

Moments after our story ended, Utah Representative Paul Ray began writing a bill to ban Salvia. We were there on Capitol Hill to see the paperwork filed.

Rep. Paul Ray, (R) Clearfield: "We're basically going to make it illegal to possess or sell. Period."

Late today we learned one local police department is also reacting to our story. They've decided now is the right time to educate officers about the herb, emailing out information and photos of Salvia. http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=682728 News Drugs 2 22 0 0 salvia hallucinogen herb 0 1 tripzine 2006-11-29 11:55:26 30 0 www.tripzine.com 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 65 2010-04-06 14:32:35

75 30 traffic 01.30.01 Traffic Steven Soderbergh 's latest film is heavy on style and chock full of anti drug-war propaganda, but does it deliver the dope? Christopher Dale <font color=ff0000><b>YOU MAY HAVE HEARD</b></font> about this movie 'Traffic', a gritty real-life portrayal of life on the front lines of the drug war, directed artfully by Steven Soderbergh and crammed end to end with major Hollywood stars. Sure you've heard about it, maybe you've even seen it by now. It's up for a few awards. It's full of anti drug-war propaganda. It's being labeled as a 'classic' and Soderbergh is now a 'genius'. But is the movie really all that good?

I went into Traffic with high expectations and must say that it was quite good for a movie churned out of the Hollywood system. Soderbergh's film-school tricks for adding hues or extra exposure to scenes depending on their mood and location embedded a layer of depth and tension into the narrative and gave the whole film a by-the-hip indie feel you'd expect from a younger director. And the way the varying levels of storytelling intersected silently with each other in random locations throughout the film gives the viewer a heightened sense of thoughtfulness from the director that you wouldn't expect from a typical cut-and-paste action thriller.

Yes, it is a good movie. Even the actors are good in it, and the two prep-school baseheads played by Erika Christensen and Topher Grace (That '70s Show) are especially interesting. But where Traffic ultimatly piles up is in the screenplay itself. The story is good and the message is clear ("The Drug War is futile at best, deadly at worst"), but the way in which the story plays out left me feeling a bit cheated, once again lied to by the slick merchandising machine that is Hollywood.

If you have not seen the movie and hate spoilers you can stop reading here and skip ahead to the last paragraph. I am about to divulge a few problems I had with the end of the film. First off, the realism of the movie flew completely out the window as conservative Drug-Czar to be Robert Wakefield (played effortlessly by Michael Douglas) caves in on his acceptance speech and has a tender change of heart about his hard-line Drug War beliefs in front of the American public. He then races to support his crack-addicted daughter through treatment and recovery and we are led to believe that through his courage and a little lip-service at narc-anon that everything will be alright. Up until this point the movie was fairly unflinching in its attempt at realism, even convincing, but the over-the-top Oliver Stone-ing of message coupled with the 'coming-up-roses' ending made me feel sold. For all the plot complexity, in the end the message was as crisp and heavy-handed as an after-school special.

Despite all that, I wouldn't recommend that you just say 'No' to Traffic. Even though it's only about blow I would say it's worth seeing, but do keep a critical eye on the message vs. what actually happens in the movie. The contradictions in this film are as earnest and illogical as America's own love/hate relationship with drugs, and maybe that's the movie's whole point. Either way, it is still a good movie by Hollywood standards.

It's called Salvia and its perfectly legal to buy even though some say it's as dangerous as LSD.

It comes in a plastic disc, about the size of a half dollar, filled with a dried herb called Purple Sticky Salvia.

The package says its incense - but teens say that's just a smoke-screen.

"When you inhale it it just makes you go to your own little world"...

"Its just an eerie feeling sometimes you see people and wonder why they're there"...

76 30 downey 01.30.01 Poster Boy Choosing who or what goes on the cover of a magazine is one of the most important decisions a publisher can make. Take a look at some of the issues we deal with. James Kent <font color=ff0000><b>SO I WAS THINKING</b></font> about relaunching this magazine I publish, TRP: The Resonance Project, but there was a problem with it. The name was too long. People kept mispronouncing 'resonance', or pronouncing it right but confusing us with another fine Seattle periodical called 'Resonance' that covers the dance music scene. It was a pain. The name was meant to convey a complex metaphysical idea within a handy three letter acronym, but some people just weren't getting it. Some understood, a few even cheered the concept of a 'Resonance Project', but everyone else just called it TRP, or Trip.

Yes, <i>trip</i> is a much shorter meme with less baggage and more action. It is nowhere near as academic or arcane as TRP, but it is freer and, dare we say, a bit hipper. It will infiltrate the mind faster, stick longer, and go farther. It is borne into motion and built to travel. That is what it is, a <i>trip</i>, a journey through space and time where every tiny detail is as important as the big picture. 

Once we had decided on the name change I began ruminating about what to put on the cover of the first issue. Choosing who or what goes on the cover of a magazine is one of the most important decisions a publisher can make. A cover not only defines who and what you are, but it also dictates where your magazine will be placed on the racks even moreso than actual content. For example, a magazine with Brad Pitt or Madonna on the cover will get front-row placement next to 'Vogue' or 'GQ' even if the magazine is about organic gardening. It is what publishers with fringe markets do to branch out to the mainstream and attract new readers. It is called marketing. 

Which brings us to poor Robert Downey Jr. (or RDJ as we like to call him around here). RDJ is in an interesting position right now because he represents the grand paradox of American drug culture. Here is one of our generation's best and brightest, a celebrated actor of exceeding wit and charm, and a purebred product of the Hollywood drug culture. He would be indistinguishable from any one of a dozen of his peers except for one thing: he got himself in trouble. Now he is more famous than all of them, just won a Golden Globe for 'Ally McBeal', and could go back to jail for doing even more drugs! What could be more interesting than <i>that</i>? Let's put him on the cover! Our distributors will love us!

Cashing in on the tragedy of celebrity is nothing new for magazines -- in fact it may be the reason magazines were invented -- but we've never really done it before. Having a celebrity on the cover would definitely mean better placement on the stands, higher sales, more money, and more unsuspecting members of the mainstream being accidently exposed to our supremely radical vision, so the decision seemed obvious. We will sell out. We will put RDJ on the cover. We will rationalize it all on payday.

But then we thought about it for a few days and started to feel icky. The questions started to gnaw at us. Is RDJ really the kind of role model we want for our magazine? Will putting him on the cover glorify his self-destructive behavior? Will our subscribers be offended by this brazen move towards the mainstream? And, most of all, will RDJ even return our phone calls? These are the things we think about, the spiritual politics of playing in the big media circus. Do we step into the mainstream like we're in charge or keep our heads down and walk safely and quietly through the subculture. 

In the end we decided the RDJ cover was more of a spoof then a real cover. We chose instead a spectacular image from an underground artist named Morpheus. It probably won't warrant placement next to 'Details' or 'Spin', but it will find a nice spot in the alternative section and probably deserves more exposure than RDJ anyway. And though I hate to use the term "keepin' it real" when I'm not all pimped-out in my black velvet Nike track suit, that is essentially what we are doing here. We changed the name but we heven't changed the game. That RDJ shit, we was just frontin' on that, for real.

79 30 sirius from TRP 5 An Interview with RU Sirius A look inside the mind of Mondo's errant editor and the man who might have been president Malvolio Rutteledge <b>MR: In "Revolution #5" on Disinfo.com, you wrote, "The truth can now be told... the United States is a police state..." How far ranging do you think the drug war has become in orchestrating the bulk of current U.S. troubles? Do you feel that the suppression of cannabis and other entheogens is really the major political lynchpin that libertarians such as Dick Cowan would have us believe? We're talking vested interests here...</b>

RU: I consider the drug war to be a bigger disaster for America than the war in Viet Nam. In terms of the destruction of our civil liberties, the evolution of a prison/industrial complex, some five and a half million people in prisons... so that now there's a vested economic interest in incarcerating people, the majority of them for drugs... the McCarthyism of ubiquitous drug testing, the seizure of property without trial or conviction, just on and on. The question I have is where are our Berrigan brothers? Where's our Doctor Spock? Where are the religious persons of conscience spilling blood on files in the DEA offices? They've got something like 30% of young black males now in the criminal punishment system, the US is being denounced by Amnesty International because the prisons themselves are torture chambers. Where's the peace movement? 

<b>Why are prisons and entertainment the only growing U.S. industry?</b>

Well, we're the first post-industrial state. Leisure, play, amusement, those are the would-be industries of the future. Prison is a kind of enforced leisure I guess, in a weird sort of way.

<b>You wrote that most Americans find the current totalitarian state passable as long as they are not directly involved with it. Just how totalitarian IS the United States? </b>

Well, you don't see any great uprising do you? I mean, they're searching our urine! On a certain highway outside of Austin, Texas, on random days, they just pull everybody over and search their cars for drugs. You're supposed to be able to refuse to have your car searched without reasonable cause, but the Texas judiciary in its wisdom has figured out that refusing IS reasonable cause. There's an institutionalized Catch 22 right there in Texas but don't ask don't tell anyone.

<b>Professor David Marc wrote in "The Bonfire of the Humanities" that the current drug prohibition is aimed at the lower class and the middle class because the government "doesn't want people too stoned to go to work." Do you agree? </b>

I think it's one element of a confluence of reasons. The illegality of drugs is a huge industry. I'm sure when Nixon escalated it into a war, it was at least partly about budgets... who gets to have a project and get a bunch of money. The DEA... the various arms of law enforcement and the justice system involved in that particular area. And then there was just the cultural hostility towards the underclass, towards blacks and, particularly in its origins in 1968, against hippies and the "new left." Finally, there's the black budget profits that are gained by keeping the pleasure drug industry in the shadows.

<b>I often look at photos of the drug czar and wonder what is in that guy's head. What is in that guy's head? He obviously believes in state obscurantism... </b>

He doesn't look much like a Czar, does he? What's the story with General Barry McCaffrey? He seems smart and yet he says such dumb things. Does he know any better? We know Bill and Al know better. It was probably politically expedient for them to choose somebody who was totally clueless when it came to drugs.

<b>What role do you see sociobiology playing in future organization of society? Edward O. Wilson's work at one point was regarded (and possibly still is) as quite heretical in that it posited an almost completely deterministic conception of the human species. It's interesting how this could tie in with Huxley's satire on society, Brave New World.</b>

I've just been re-reading Edward O. Wilson's On Human Nature and it strikes me as much more poetic, humane and sympathetic the second time through. I find it amusing that some humanists are offended by the notion that there's any connection whatsoever between human societal organization and behavior and animal societal organization and behavior. Talk about human chauvinism. It's weird when you talk to people whose opinions on science and the nature of things is dictated by political comfort, so that exploring the biological roots of behavior becomes verboten. That's weird. Don't even look over here. Don't think about this. Umm... Animal Farm, yes.

<b>How do you feel about voting? </b>

Nauseous. Actually, I want people to vote for me. I've started the new political party, The Revolution, and I'm our candidate for President! Just say R.U. Sirius, the only response to the other candidates. In all seriousness, I think if we non-authoritarians voted, we could form a power block that would provide a countervailing influence to the right wing moralists and also help to break the Republicrat two-party hold on the political process.

<b>Can you define the political platform of your Revolution party? </b>

I would define it as 21st Century Humanist Libertarianism, or damned near something like that. 

<b>If you were elected president today, what would your first domestic and foreign policy decisions be? </b>

My first domestic policy decision after ordering up pizza would be to pardon all federal prisoners in for non-violent drug possession charges and all prisoners listed with Amnesty International. My second move would be to stop providing all the arms to pretty much everybody globally... 

<b>In your opinion are there any grey areas at all between anarchy and authoritarinism, and if there are how can we ever hope to acheive a happy medium? </b>

Absolutely. I'm not an anarchist in any absolutist sense. I think the Jeffersonian tradition as reflected in the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights is plenty anti-authoritarian. We've never lived up to those principles. 

<b>What do you think is the most dangerous thing about the Internet? </b>

Ubiquitous decentralized media more or less destroys social consensus, destroys consensus reality, by dispersing attention. This is on the one hand desirable, but it's also problematic. You can't bring people together too easily, for instance, to make social change. 

<b>Do you think WebTV will catch on? It has been claimed that it could revolutionize the world. For example, in China, where the state controls most media, if all you need is a TV and a keyboard you could access the Internet. Still, one does not hear much about WebTV. Predictions?</b>

Eventually, there will be a medium that will allow individuals to upload video, both tape and live, so that individuals will be able to broadcast materials at the same level of quality that we're accustomed to. Will it revolutionize the world? I think in some sense, the utter decentralization of public media and public discourse devolutionizes the world, but in an interesting way. We can no longer locate a consensus reality to subvert. The only thing that would revolutionize the world would be production technologies that overwhelm scarcity. The first step toward that is anything that will end our reliance on oil. I'd say we have a few years &#151; less than a decade &#151; to make a complete transition from oil usage &#151; if we're lucky. Probably, it's already too late.

<b>After spending the early 90s at Mondo &#151; ground-zero of the whole cyber-psychedelic rave-culture explosion &#151; what do you think of the shape of that particular scene today? What do you think the next big wave of countercultural revolution will look like? </b>

The commercial rave scene has spread psychedelic experimentation and thinking among youths like nothing since the hippie culture in the sixties, but I'm not personally interested. Smaller private rave gatherings are still pretty nice. It's almost become the assumption that an opening for a new hip magazine, or even a sugar saturated beverage trying to appear hip, will have a rave party for their opening. It's ubiquitous. I don't think we can talk in terms of counterculture anymore because the consensus reality that counter would be counter to is so confused and dispersed. I think we'll see more and more subculture. But I also think that people who like to mind their own business will get political for obvious reasons of self-protection... 

<b>What was your overall experience as editor for Mondo? Seemed like a cool position to be in.</b>

Mondo was the biggest fun of my life. When it was in its groove for a couple of years, it was a pleasure to be part of it. There weren't really any office rules, and yet we made it work. I could smoke DMT in the living room on a work day, if the moment seemed right. I haven't been able to find another job like that!

<b>What do you think of Wired magazine? It seems like a giant hoax to me. Like George. A yes-man club of a few yuppie technophiles. What are your favorite magazines? Do you like Hustler?</b>

Wired was interesting early on, when it explored some topics in depth. But Wired was a safe corporate clone of Mondo 2000, and the current Wired is an even safer corporate clone of itself. The early Wired was, at least, an authentic project of genuine technophiles. The current Wired is being done by professional journalists, people with no connection to technoculture &#151; people of no vision who laughed at the notion of cyberculture before it became mainstream. I like Pop Smear, a very hip and funny sort of tabloidesque semi-pornographic zine out of New York City. And I like Mean, which is a very well-written sort of subculture/pop zine. Hustler doesn't really have much in terms of interesting content, although I like pornography in general. I prefer Club International as far as straightforward semi-gynecological photos of distortedly silicone-based hyper-sexualized young women are concerned. I liked 21.c, a technoculture zine out of Australia that straddled the line between academic and pop, but now that's gone. 

<b>What authors are you currently reading? Why?</b>

I'm finally reading Neal Stephenson's latest book. I read a chapter from it that was published in Time and thought it was great. I've been recently devouring whatever Bruce Sterling novels I hadn't already read. I think his most recent work, Distraction, is amazing. And I'm reading this book called BOGGS: A Comedy of Values, by Lawrence Weschler. It's about this artist who paints money and trades the paintings at the value he puts on the money for goods and services. In other words, if he paints a $50 bill he convinces someone to take it in trade for $50 worth of whatever...

<b>Do you like Ketamine? </b>

I like Ketamine mostly because it doesn't last very long. If someone would come up with an LSD or a psilocybin where you could peak in a few minutes and be completely done in an hour-and-a-half, that would be just as good. But Ketamine, I think, gets you to your core address. It gives you the perspective of distance, but with a weird technological edge.

<b>In "The Scientist", Lilly had a vision on Ketamine where he went into the future and saw all the cars running on water vapor. I saw a week ago in the news that Chrystler-Daimler-Benz revealed a car that does just that and will be available for purchase in 2004... </b>

I definitely believe that scientific and technological solutions present themselves in psychedelic experiences. 

<b>What kind of new technology have you been using or like?</b>

I'm not that much of a user of technology. Like William Gibson, I follow technology and its cultural significance. I leave the hacking to others. I like the whole MP3 thing though. I really want there to be a global jukebox attached to some kind of machine. I put in my credit card or my ATM card and for say $1 I can hear any album that was ever recorded. Once I've picked that album say 15 times, I own it and can listen to it any time I want. 

<b>A friend of mine bitterly claims that the TV he watched as a child created archetypes in his mind that will never go away. Do you think that's true? I mean, there is the use-it-or-lose-it law of mental processing, right?</b>

Ward, I think it's time to have a few words with the Beaver. He sounds like he's on drugs or something.

80 30 vine from TRP 1 Vine of the Souls A Closer Look at Amozonia's Visionary Medicine Charlie Kidder <font color=ff0000><b>DEEP IN THE HEART</b></font> of the Amazonian rainforest grows a sacred vine known for its magical powers. This vine is known by many names, but the most well known of them all may be ayahuasca (aye-yah-wah-skah). In the Quechua language, aya means spirit or ancestor, and huasca means vine or rope. It is reputed that those who consume this vine of the souls are bestowed with the ability to commune with spirits, diagnose illness, treat disease, and even predict the future. While the existence of this vine is certainly no big secret, it is only recently that western science has decided to study the magical properties of this sacred medicine. 

Archaeological evidence may date ayahuasca use in Ecuador back five millennia. However, western knowledge of ayahuasca dates back only as far as 1851 when a group of Tukanoan Indians invited British botanist and explorer Richard Spruce to participate in a ceremony which included a visionary drink they called caapi. Spruce only drank a small amount of the "nauseous beverage," but he couldn't help noticing the profound effect it had on his new friends. The Tukanoans showed Spruce the plant from which the caapi was made, and he was able to collect good specimens of the plant in full flower. Spruce named the plant Banisteria caapi, and further research led him to conclude that caapi, yage, and ayahuasca were all Indian names for the same potion made using this one vine. 

Since these early findings, indigenous use of various ayahuasca potions has been reported throughout the Amazon as far east as the R'o Negro in Brazil and as far west as the Pacific coastal areas of Colombia and Ecuador. It is also found as far north as the Panama coast, and southward into areas of Amazonian Perœ and Bolivia. At least 72 indigenous groups have been found to use similar preparations known by a total of over forty different names. 

<b>Preparation</b>

Ayahuasca potions are normally prepared by soaking or steeping lianas of Banisteriopsis caapi or related species for various lengths of time. The specific method varies from group to group, but the simplest method is a cold water infusion where pieces of the stem are first pounded and allowed to stand in cold water, after which the plant material is strained off and the remaining potion drunk. Some groups will immerse the pounded stems in hot water, cooking the plant material anywhere from an hour to all day long. The longest of these preparation methods involves repeated boiling and filtering of the plant matter and extract until only a thick concentrate remains. This process normally comprises a whole day's work, taking up to fifteen hours to prepare a single batch. 

Banisteriopsis caapi is often the only plant used to make ayahuasca. However, it is not an uncommon practice to add one or more admixture plants to the brew during its preparation. Admixture plants help to flavor the experience of each specific batch of ayahuasca, and often contain stimulants or visionary compounds, like caffeine, nicotine, or DMT. In ayahuasca potions made using DMT-containing additives, it is most likely that DMT is the key visionary ingredient, responsible for most if not all of the potion's powerful entheogenic effects. 

<b>Pharmacology of Ayahuasca </b>

DMT was first synthesized in 1931, fifteen years before it was discovered to be a naturally occuring compound. DMT is found in many psychoactive Amazonian snuffs prepared from the resin of numerous species of Virola trees, and was first naturally extracted from a shamanic snuff made from the crushed seeds and pods of Anadenanthera peregrina in 1955. In 1956, Stephen I. Szara and colleagues became the first to experience the effects of the hydrochloride salt of N,N-Dimethyltryptamine via intramuscular injection at doses ranging from 0.7 to 1.1 mg per kg body weight. He found the drug to produce what he described as a "psychotic effect partially similar to that caused by mescaline or LSD-25." Szara found that after injecting 50 to 60 mg of DMT, entheogenic effects commenced within two to three minutes, lasting about 45 minutes to an hour. He described the effects thus: "Eidetic phenomena, optical illusions, pseudo-hallucinations and later real hallucinations, appeared. The hallucinations consisted of moving, brilliantly colored oriental motifs, and later I saw wonderful scenes altering very rapidly. The faces of the people seemed to be masks. My emotional state was elevated sometimes up to euphoria..." 

By 1977, it was established that smoking DMT free base produces a more potent and rapid effect than does injection. Thirty mg of DMT smoked was found to produce almost instant peak effects, lasting a total of only five to ten minutes. However, DMT has been tested in doses of up to an entire gram ingested orally without producing any effects whatsoever. So the question remained: Since DMT appears to be completely inactive orally, how can the average 29 mg found in an orally ingested dose of ayahuasca produce a visionary effect? 

The answer to this question lies in the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). This enzyme normally functions in our digestive systems to break down any monoamines present within the foods we eat so that they do not upset the balances of monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism going on in our brains. DMT, being a monoamine, is completely oxidized and decomposed by MAO in the gut when it is ingested orally. However, the §-carboline alkaloids from the Banisteriopsis liana are know to inhibit MAO to the point where the accompanying DMT from the admixture plant can survive in the digestive tract and make its way to the brain. 

The structure of DMT (as well as those of other entheogenic compounds) is remarkably close to that of the important modulatory neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT). Such neurotransmitter shuffling is thought to bring about the disinhibition of normally controlled and regulated processes within the brain. The binding of serotonin-like molecules to the 5-HT receptors affects serotonergic neurons which can stimulate a wide range of things - from repressed emotions and memories to the brain's image-processing system. This unique combination of neural stimuli results in a wondrous explosion of transcendent emotion and internal kaleidoscopic imagery. 

<b>Shamanic Use of Ayahuasca </b>

The mestizo shamans of the Peruvian Amazon generally refer to themselves as vegetalistas. These plant-doctors help the people of rural areas and the urban poor who often have no other available help in critical situations requiring medical attention. Most vegetalistas tend to specialize, using just one or few plant teachers in their practices. Thus there are tabaqueros who use tobacco; toeros who use various Brugmansia species; catahueros who use the resin of catahua (Hura crepitans); paleros who use the bark of various large trees; perfumeros who use the scents of various fragrant plants; and ayahuasqueros who use ayahuasca. 

The shamanic use of ayahuasca is usually within the context of healing. The shaman or ayahuasquero takes ayahuasca to better diagnose the nature of the patient's illness. Vegetalistas claim they receive their healing skills from certain plant teachers, who are believed to have a madre or spirit-mother. The role of the shaman is to mediate the transmission of medicinal knowledge from the plant teacher to the human world for use in curing. 

The plant teachers are believed to teach the neophyte shaman a number of power songs or supernatural melodies called icaros, either during an ayahuasca session or in dreams following the ingestion of other plant teachers. The plant teachers give the magical songs to the vegetalista so that he or she may sing or whistle them during healing sessions. Some shamans place so much emphasis on the healing power of the icaros that once he or she has learned a good number of them, the ayahuasca is no longer necessary for healing. 

Artist and Peruvian vegetalista Pablo Amaringo has painted a series of his past ayahuasca visions, depicting them in great detail. In order to do this, Amaringo will attempt to recall one of his visions, sometimes by singing the icaro he sang at the time of the vision. This brings back the image so vividly that Amaringo is able to project it onto a canvas and then simply trace it adding colors later. Images from ayahuasca visions are a predominate feature of Amazonian art. It has been suggested that this visual art along with the melodies of the icaros combine with the synaesthetic effects of the potion to produce an "aesthetic frame of mind" central to the healing process. The design the shaman paints onto his or her body is believed to represent a healthy energy pattern, and is often revealed by the ayahuasca. 

When a person becomes sick, their energy pattern becomes distorted. Under the influence of ayahuasca, the shaman can see the distortion in the patient's energy pattern and attempt to restore a healthy pattern using suction, massage, medicinal plants, hydrotherapy, and restoration of the patient's soul. The similarities between these shamanic methods and techniques used in traditional Chinese chi-gong, or "energy directed" medicine, should be noted. Interestingly, a shaman usually chooses medicinal plants based on visible characteristics, like shape or color. For example, a plant which produces flowers shaped like an ear may be used to treat ear diseases. Part of the novice shaman's training involves scrutinizing nature to learn about the properties or "hidden virtues" within the surrounding plants and animals. 

<b>Modern Interest in Ayahuasca </b>

From the first written mention of ayahuasca by a Jesuit priest near the end of the 17th century to current research dealing with ayahuasca, our knowledge of this ancient Amazonian ethnomedicine has grown considerably. In just the last few decades, a fair number of publications have been written on the topic; anthropologists have begun studying how ayahuasca is used to heal; and research groups have started studying the potion's long-term physiological and psychological effects. Another interesting modern phenomenon is the growing number of Christian churches throughout South America who have opted for ayahuasca as their sacrament during communion instead of the usual symbolic bread and wine sacraments. These churches claim that the potion helps to promote intense concentration and direct contact with the spiritual plane. 

The first of these ayahuasca churches were initially formed in the 1920s in Brazil, and today two groups, the Uni‹o de Vegetal (UDV or 'Herbal Union') and the Santo Daime [see related article], continue to flourish. These neo-Christian churches now mainly exist in urban areas, and represent the modern movement of ritual ayahuasca use from the primal rainforest into the big city. 

In these churches mass is held once a week. The church members cultivate the plants needed to make the potion, and oversee its preparation and storage. On special occasions, ayahuasca is dispensed in small cups at communion. The dose is only a couple of ounces, but the ayahuasca they produce has been reported to be very strong. As the celebration usually lasts all night long, it is not unusual for members of the church to take several doses during the course of the evening. 

In 1985, the Brazilian government added the ayahuasca liana to its list of controlled substances. The UDV soon petitioned the ban and the Brazilian government appointed a commission to investigate the issue. The commission found no evidence of social disruption associated with the sacramental use of ayahuasca (which the commission members tried themselves) and ayahuasca was removed from the Brazilian controlled substances list in August of 1987. More problems arose in 1988 when an anonymous source alleged that the churches consisted of fanatics, drug addicts, and ex-guerrillas given to smoking Cannabis and taking LSD during their rites. Yet another study of the issue was ordered by the government, this time to investigate the physiological aspects of ayahuasca's pharmacology. The conclusions of this study prompted the Brazilian government in June of 1992 to exempt Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis - as well as the ayahuasca potion - from its illicit substances list. This legal decision has opened the doors to the further expansion of these churches, which have since held ceremonies in several cities all over the world. An international scientific research team, the Hoasca Project, has recently begun studying the long term effects, both psychological and physiological, of chronic ayahuasca use by these church members. 

<b>Ayahuasca and the Future </b>

It is hard to say what the future may hold for ayahuasca. It could prove to be a useful tool in helping science better understand the biochemistry of consciousness and the genetics of pathological brain function. Pharmaceutical MAO-inhibitors are widely used in western medicine as anti-depressants, and further research into the psychotherapeutic benefits gained from the tryptamines remains to be done. 

As far as religion is concerned, the potential for expansion of ayahuasca-using churches seems unlimited. Incorporation of a powerful psychoactive sacrament into religious ceremonies could have far-reaching effects on modern spiritual practices and beliefs. However, it remains to be seen whether entheogen users here in the U.S. would be attracted to the idea of psychedelic Christianity. 

All in all, ayahuasca represents a unique plant-based medicine. The fact that its traditional use by Amazonian Indians has survived the continual influence of Western acculturation is testimony to the central and important role it has in their world-view. In fact, in many Amazonian tribes the first thing the parents will give a newborn baby is a drop of ayahuasca - right in the mouth. To them it is the supreme medicine, and a true gift from the gods.

176 30 ed4 TRP 4 So Where the Hell is Hyperspace? Everyone's talking about it, but how do we get there? James Kent Hyperspace - 1.) An accelerated or excited space. 2.) Any dimension above and beyond 3-D spacetime (commonly referred to as "reality"). So when looking for hyperspace, we would be searching for any space or dimension that exists above and beyond the reality we normally perceive. Many scholars, mathematicians, and mystics have spent many lifetimes attempting to discover exactly what and where hyperspace actually is, but the main problem of hyperspace is that you can't actually see it. You can't even poke at it. No matter how fervently or convincingly you argue or attempt to prove its existence, you can never really know if it's actually there.

Okay, so maybe that's hyperbole.

The truth is, if we had enough energy (and I'm talking about a lot of energy) we could conceivably open some kind of vortex to hyperspace. However, even if we had the energy of 100 suns to dedicate to this project, all we would get is a shaky, unstable, minuscule singularity barely the width of a photon. What would we do with that? Anything that went in would probably never come out, and the area around the singularity would bend and warp and cause all kinds of messy temporal and spacial distortions. Nope, unless our current sources of generating energy improve dramatically hyperspace will remain out of our physical reach. And because our senses are wired to perceive such a narrow spectrum of reality, it would seem we are forever banished to exist solely in the hard cold world of 3-D spacetime. 

However, what if there were a way to experientially reproduce the phenomenon of existing in higher dimensional states? What if instead of bending space itself we could somehow bend the perceptual boundaries that limit our view of reality? What if there was some switch we could throw to blow open our default data-gathering settings so we could start receiving information on broadband instead of narrow-spectrum? Would you want to throw that switch? Would you want to take a look into hyperspace?

Of course you would. Who wouldn't?

There are only two good reasons I can think of why somebody would shy away from the experience of having their perceptual veils lifted. The first is that they are scared of what they might find. The mere thought of having one's ontology shattered into a million pieces at the flip of the switch can be somewhat jarring, no doubt. The second reason I can think of for refusing the experience is that it may be considered a cultural taboo. Either of these cases on its own would be good enough reason to avoid such things, but when the two forces are combined &#151; ontological uneasiness and social pressures &#151; they spell outright fear.

So what's so scary about hyperspace? Does it pose some kind of threat to our way of life? Is it the mythical boundary between life and death? Does it cross that thin line between reality and fantasy land, sanity and insanity? Does it hold secrets that mere mortals were never meant to behold? Whatever it is, it is a force to be reckoned with, and not to be stepped into lightly.

Of the many ways people have attempted to grok hyperspace over the last few millennia, possibly the most interesting and controversial method has been the ingestion of DMT. DMT is not just another psychedelic drug to be studied and cataloged. No, it may very well be the Holy Grail to hyperspace so many have been looking for. Neurochemically speaking, DMT is like a synaptic skeleton key to hyper-consciousness. It is similar in structure to serotonin and other common neurotransmitters, and it fits in very nicely at most major receptor sites. When the neural matrix is suddenly flooded with this sublime substance, it is akin to having all of your neural switches instantaneously flipped on all at once. The effects are so dramatic that they are overwhelming, and some might even say astonishing. 

When I tried DMT for the first time, it's true I was a bit startled. I was not expecting the substance of what I saw to be so real. I had the exhilarating feeling that I was fully awake for possibly the first time in my life. My eyes and ears were opened to a dimension of vision and sound that I could never have imagined existed. It was not just hallucination or simple perceptual distortion &#151; that would have been easy to cope with. What I experienced was more like perceptual amplification and magnification, a full awakening of the senses. I could suddenly see jeweled detail and temporal depth in everything I looked at. Objects no longer held the illusion of solidity, but revealed themselves as distinct vibrational fields in constant transition through time. It was a life-changing experience, and one that has led me to remark that DMT may be "the single most exquisite substance on the entire planet."

What do I mean by that? Well, for starters, I never really comprehended just how complex and mysterious reality was until I first smoked DMT. I had received vague inklings of cosmic depth and quick glimpses into hidden forces via other transcendent experiences in my lifetime, but never had I witnessed the intricate processes which hold reality together on such a visceral level. Sub atomic, molecular, genetic, electromagnetic, and cosmic forces all became explicit before my eyes. These were no longer abstract concepts, but actual processes unfolding in real-time before my eyes. It was &#151; how shall I say &#151; heavy.

So with that heaviness in mind, let us step into the world of DMT and the bizarre hyperspace it evokes. These pages contain a multitude of new insights and new information into the understanding of this awe-inspiring chemical from some of today's most noted scholars. We may think that we are a fairly advanced civilization, but we are only now beginning to peel away at the thin layers of our reality. I doubt anyone is fully ready for what we will find, but I have no doubt that DMT is one of the keys to breaking through this barrier. The voyage has only but begun.

179 30 salvia_au 5.31.2002 Salvia Divinorum Outlawed in Australia An Update from the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics Made possible by
the <a href="http://www.alchemind.org/salvia_defense_fund.htm" target="new">Salvia Divinorum Defense Fund</a> 

 

Effective June 1, Australia becomes the first country to make the plant Salvia divinorum a prohibited drug. Pursuant to a ruling by Australia's National Drugs And Poisons Schedule Committee (NDPSC), both Salvia divinorum and its active principle salvinorin A, will be added to Schedule 9 of Australia's Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons (SUSDP). Australia's action raises fears that other governments may soon follow suit.

 

Schedule 9 is Australia's most restrictive drug schedule, and includes "substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities."

 

Under Australian law, drug control is a state rather than a federal issue. Thus the NDPSC's decision is technically only a recommendation to Australia's states and territories to prohibit both S. divinorum and salvinorin A. It is practically unheard of, however, for states to deviate from the NDPSC's rulings. Accordingly it is a fait accompli that the possession, distribution, or cultivation of S. divinorum and salvinorin A will now be considered a criminal offense in all of Australia.

 

The Alchemind Society's Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics has been in contact with a group of scientific researchers in Australia who are working to challenge the NDPSC's ruling and block its adoption by the various states and territories. So far these efforts have been unsuccessful.

 

Australia's scheduling of S. divinorum raises concerns that the US DEA, which is known to be evaluating the plant for scheduling, may be spurred to prohibit the plant as well. In anticipation of similar action by the DEA, the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics (CCLE) has established a SALVIA DIVINORUM DEFENSE FUND for the purpose of raising the money necessary to present a legal challenge to any scheduling move by the DEA. In October of last year, a group of experts coordinated by the CCLE submitted a written report to the US DEA, finding that Salvia divinorum does not meet the criteria for inclusion in Schedule I of the US Controlled Substance Act. 

 

Please Make a Tax-deductable donation to the Salvia Divinorum Defense Fund.

The CCLE continues to monitor Salvia divinorum's legal situation on a daily basis. With your support, we will be able to mount a legal challenge to a future scheduling move by the US DEA.

The NDPSC's decision to place the S. divinorum and its active principle into Schedule 9 – a schedule reserved for drugs with a "high potential for abuse" and which present a "risk to public health and safety" – appears to have no factual support. 

At its August 2001 meeting, The NDPSC considered scheduling S. divinorum, noting that the plant was being "advertis[ed] for sale in Australia and some broad based e-mail discussion groups on Australian web sites have included discussion threads on Salvia divinorum." 

Traditional shamanic use of the plant was discounted by the NDPSC, which dismissively commented, "There was no evidence of traditional therapeutic use other than in shamanistic healing rituals."

Finally, while placement in Schedule 9 requires a finding that the plant or substance presents a public health problem, the NDPSC made an end-run around this important criterion, stating:

 "The Jurisdictions advised the Committee that they had not been advised that this herb was causing public health problems, however this may simply reflect the relative "newness" of the herb as a potential substance of abuse."

The NDPSC concluded its August 2001 meeting by noting: "there appear[s] to be a prima facie case for control of Salvia divinorum as an hallucinogen, but ... there was no evidence of a major public health hazard at this stage. Accordingly, the Committee agreed to foreshadow appropriate Schedule 9 entries and seek public comment

At its next meeting, held in November 2001, the NDPSC noted "there was no response to the pre-meeting gazette notice in relation to the foreshadowed decision to include Salvia Divinorum in Schedule 9 of the SUSDP. However, a Minute was received from the Office of Complementary Medicines of the TGA, thanking the Committee for considering the inclusion of S. divinorum into the SUSDP on public health and safety grounds."

Yet, with no more evidence than what existed (or didn't exist) in August 2001, the NDPSC then summarily ruled (Decision 2001/33-7) to include "Salvia Divinorum in Schedule 9 of the SUSDP, on the basis of high potential for abuse and risk to public health and safety." 

In addition, the NDPSC included in Schedule 9 "8-METHOXYCARBONYL-4A,8A-DIMETHYL-6-ACETOXY- 5-KETO-3,4,4B,7,9,10,10A-SEPTAHYDRO-3-(4-FURANYL)- 2,1-NAPHTHO[4,3-E]PYRONE *(SALVINORIN A)."

181 30 erikdavisms2 from Trip6 Psychedelic Culture: One or Many? Erik Davis What I'd like to do here is paint a picture of psychedelic culture and how it relates to the larger world that we're in. There are a lot of interesting angles with which people approach psychedelic culture. Of course there've always been very different models of how psychedelics influence the greater culture - how they should influence it, and how they do influence it. If you go back to the Sixties, sometimes we have a simplistic idea that the counterculture was one great wave of psychedelic experience that was united in its ethos, in its ways of thinking about what way the world should go. That's not really the case. There were a lot of very different subsets of people, even at that time. You had people driven very much by a kind of psychotherapeutic approach - how is this going to help in dealing with individual psychology, and the psychology of groups. You had the sort of elitist perennialism of Aldous Huxley and his school. On the other side of it, you had the Prankster approach, which was far more anarchic - let's throw it all out there and see what happens, let's spread it wide, let's bring it all down. You had the great tensions between, especially in the Seventies, Timothy Leary and Ram Dass. At some point in the Sixties, Leary was often seen as sort of a semi-guru guy, but at a certain point he really very strongly turned away from that model, from the custard mush of Hindu spirituality, and became much more invested in a kind of proto-extropian, highly technological view of the future of humanity. Whereas on the other hand, you had his former colleague, Richard Alpert, really keeping the connections between psychedelic experience and a variety of mystical and spiritual traditions very closely bound. 

So even if we look at the background of where we've come from, we see a lot of divergence. And today we also have a great deal of divergence. You have people who are very scientifically oriented and in many ways quite skeptical of the kinds of claims you can make about the worlds of experience that psychedelics open up. On the other hand, you have a very strong pull towards religion and/or spirituality in certain kinds of forms; there's the idea that there are certain spirits behind these experiences, that they have a kind of collective message, and that by engaging in this we're learning a certain kind of truth which is organized often by certain institutions or groups. This divergence of course is extremely productive. It's very dynamic; it's very open-ended. The best aspect of psychedelic culture in terms of what it presents to the larger culture is this open-endedness, a lack of resolution, a constant dynamic interplay between matter and spirit, science and experience, subjectivity and chemistry. That tension of constantly moving relationships is in many ways what makes this such a productive and fascinating part of our culture. 

But what does "psychedelic culture" mean? In the broader respects, in many ways you can look outside and say that psychedelics won. If you look at advertising, if you look at MTV, if you look at computer graphics, if you look at a lot of things inside of the emerging cybersphere, you will find traces and sometimes overt quotations of psychedelic experience and psychedelic culture. I'm sure if you took some of the advertisements you see for soda pop and international financial institutions back to 1967 and said, "Check this out," they'd say, "Wow, that's the stuff." And that's a fascinating tale. If we ever know - and I do hope someday we know -the extent of the influence of psychedelics on the computer industry, I'm sure it's remarkable. And we know some of what that is, but for obvious reasons, it's a story that remains untold. I was talking to Lawrence Hagerty [author of "The Spirit of the Internet: Speculations on the Evolution of Global Consciousness"] who was talking about how Sun Microsystems is beating the pants off some of the other monsters out there, and Sun is one major corporation out there that doesn't do drug testing. Very interesting [applause] 

So clearly the ideas and experiences of this culture are trickling out and they have all sorts of influences that are hard to trace. What really interests me is how this psychedelic experience and psychedelic thinking can engage with the world that we're moving into, a much broader and very strange and rapidly changing world. 

SHAMANISM

What's a nice, traditional, solid model of the function of psychedelics within a larger culture? We have the great image of the shaman, a very romanticized image, very overwritten in many ways, used to mean many different things outside of its original ethnographic context. I'm not going to go into any specifics about particular shamanic cultures, but I would like to draw sort of a general picture to point out something I think is very important about psychedelic culture. One thing you can say about the shaman or witch is that she lives on the edge of cultural maps. The shaman can be seen as a kind of interface between the specific human culture of a particular tribal group and the world outside, a world that we can think of not only as nature, of course, but the cosmic, the spiritual. The witch lives at the edge of the village as we start to move into the wild. And that's a very potent way of thinking about that relationship of being a transfer point between the outside and the inside of specific human cultures. One of those interesting paradoxes of shamanism is that, on the one hand, it is very technological, very savvy, full of knowledge in almost a modern sense of knowledge, like scientific knowledge. And yet the worlds that are being produced and performed are extremely cultural, spiritual, mythological. Look at a healing ceremony, and think about what exactly is happening in a healing ceremony. Let's say that the illness is healed through the use of quartz crystals being pulled out of the body.  What's happening there? What's really going on?

One way of looking at it is that the shaman is playing a two-fold game. On the one hand, he knows very well what he's actually doing, that he's pirated a little quartz crystal in his palm, that he's using very specific plants which have very specific properties which engaged together can produce effects, both specifically related to health and in larger psychoactive issues as well. There's a tremendous amount of knowledge there. And yet, what does the shaman do in the actual situation of the healing? She performs. And what she performs is a whole cultural embeddedness of those knowledges, not simply as in our modern science - "take this pill, it'll work out for you." The knowledge is kept on the inside. And what the person perceives is a cultural story, of the illness being removed from the body. So it's not that the shaman is a skeptical trickster just playing games with quartz crystals. It's that the shaman understands some of the technology of producing cultural knowledge and transformation within that cultural matrix, and is willing to perform it as if it were fully engaged. We're realizing now that the placebo effect plays a tremendous role in healing of all sorts. And so to artfully produce the placebo effect is of course an incredibly valuable activity. 

But again, what is the function here? The shaman takes a sort of liminal role. Liminality is a concept in anthropology that describes, again, a place on the edge of cultural maps, a place between the wild and the culture, between hot and cold, between different villages. A place of tremendous liminal power in the ancient world were crossroads. Crossroads were where people from different cultures would encounter each other. And there's a whole mythology of trickster figures - Hermes, Coyote, these kinds of characters - are figures that model this relationship between inside and out. Liminality is a very important way of approaching what function, what role, what space in the whole overall cultural environment psychedelics take up. 

So if you look at this model, it's a very exciting model. Of course, many people in attempting to really take advantage of psychedelic drugs in the modern world have looked to the model of shaman healer. It's an exciting model to try to emulate in some fashion or another. But there's one very important distinction, I believe, between the world view of the traditional shaman healer and what we are faced with, which is that we do not have a coherent, contained world view. We no longer have a specific cultural story that can be performed in that mythological sense. We're at this very strange juncture in history when all these cultures are smashing into each other, we have globalization, we have fragmentation, it's a very open-ended situation. I think sometimes if there's an error in the shamanic interpretation of modern psychedelic culture, it's a kind of romanticism that wants to reconstruct or re-embody some fully coherent mythological world view. I don't want to say that in a way that undercuts the power of ancient myths and ancient knowledge. Of course one of the things that composes modern psychedelic culture is knowledges, is reception of stories, practices from the world over, and those things inform our evolving picture or cultural story about what we're doing, because that cultural story helps make the reality of experience come to be. But I think that sometimes there's a desire or a tendency to want that story to be fully realized, so that we know that actually what we're doing is engaging the mind of the planet, and the planet is telling us something. And I think in some ways those are very valuable stories, but at the same time, I think it's very important to recognize that, at the moment, we are still part of this tremendous, bizarre, horrible and fascinating process of technological modernity. We can see it breaking apart. We can see its horrible claws, its absences, and there's a desire to overcome these things quickly, or overcome them fully or entirely, leave that framework entirely in order to enter into a different kind of re-enchanted world. That desire to re-enchant the world is a profound thing that we're all feeling. It's incredibly legitimate. And yet, I think that the way in which we move forward with that is not by recovering simply a kind of mythological world view. We must keep up our relationship with those aspects of modernity that are part of psychedelic culture. 

SCIENCE

One of the more obvious models, of course, is science. And one of the paradoxes if you approach psychedelics from a scientific point of view is that on the one hand, obviously we're dealing with material substances. Obviously we're dealing with chemistry. We're dealing with tiny little objects that we can describe in the institutionalized, image-free language of science. And yet, these compounds open up worlds which seem to pull the rug out from under a more limited view of science. And yet, and yet, we cannot fully inhabit the magical, open-ended world, because we are also very much aware of the fact that they are material compounds, produced through material means that are playing all sorts of games and fascinating tricks on our neural systems. So it's a kind of Möbius strip, where the trigger opens up the space that pulls out the rug from under the whole world of triggers, the whole world of mechanism. And yet, we can't entirely resolve that, we can't leave the world where we're still acknowledging the tremendous complexity and marvels of natural science. So that's why psychedelics, more than most regions of the culture, are a place for getting very close to this magic line, where it's almost a tight rope walk between these different world views. 

Another very important aspect about psychedelics, from the perspective of more materialist and scientific ways of looking at the world, is the question it poses about consciousness, and whether first-person perspectives have any value in our attempts to understand what consciousness is. There's a tremendous amount of energy amongst the people who are doing the most work to describe what's happening in consciousness from the perspective of the brain. There's a tremendous tendency in that world to deny first-person experience as a valid way of understanding what's happening in consciousness; we can only really talk about it from a third-person perspective. Someone like Daniel Dennett is a great example of this, where any sort of internal information you get from meditation, from drugs, etc., it's just not really worth very much because we can't really capture it entirely in the kinds of frameworks that science prefers. But that's what makes it so powerful and so productive, because it's like we're opening up a gate inside of the scientific worldview, but what comes in that gate cannot be captured by it entirely. We see the same kinds of things happening now, as there's more discussion of a sort of neurology of mysticism or spiritualism, like the cover of Newsweek recently on "God and the brain." It's again a very similar kind of topic. Interestingly, they did not raise the issue of psychedelics at all. But they were approaching this odd point where we're beginning to get pretty good at a third-person description of a lot of what's going on with some of the most exalted and powerful states that human beings can achieve. And yet, there's something sort of obvious: if we're getting so close to it from this third-person perspective, how can we possibly not include a first-person perspective? 

But then it actually feeds into an aspect of our culture that is very frightening, which is a certain tendency towards control, towards the idea that what causes human beings to be the way they are are a whole set of factors that can be controlled from the outside, for the interests of this kind of way of thinking. You find it in government, you find it in science, you find it in psychotherapy, you find it in motivational speaking, you find it in all sorts of places, this tendency to say, "Well, all you have to do is trigger human beings a certain way and they will be happy or they will be productive in a capitalist sense." And so the tendency to think about consciousness from a strictly third-person point of view also plays very much into the hands of the people who believe they can use third-person perspectives in order to organize such activity. Whereas if you stepped across that line and said, "This is absurd, of course I'm going to plunge in with my own individual consciousness and make inferences, make discoveries, explore myself, explore social interaction from the perspective of these new states," you're already just in that investigation making a claim for the primary importance of subjective experience as a place to instruct, to understand, and to relate to the world. So that's another way in which psychedelics have a very interesting trickiness, because even from the perspective of hard core third-person scientists, they're inevitably fascinated by these compounds on some level or another. And yet, the closer you get to these substances, the more they pull you into a very different kind of world. It becomes more difficult to account for the phenomenon from that perspective. So it's sort of eating in and eroding some of the more regressive and reductive tendencies inside of brain science.

SET & SETTING

These compounds pull the rug out from under from simple mechanistic cosmology. We all know about set and setting. Set and setting have a tremendously powerful role in producing experience. But set and setting are not mechanistic activities. They're cultural elements. They're narrative elements. They have to do with meaning. So by going into a psychedelic experience, even from a skeptical point of view, anyone who's really investigating the phenomenon will recognize that your own mind frame, and your own physical setting, will help produce the different qualities of the events. So there's no way to fully account for that from the perspective of brain science alone. You have to go to culture. You have to go to the shaman's performance, the fact that it looks like I'm pulling a quartz crystal out of your body at some point or another. So it opens up this whole problem or issue of self-programming, programming environment, intentionality. And all of those elements, especially intentionality, are precisely the elements that are extremely vital for us to keep at the center of our vision as we move into what I often fear is a fairly concerted attack on certain kinds of individual liberties and the liberties of consciousness itself.

But again, there's kind of an interesting problem, which is the same thing that I talked about with the shamanic worldview. If we were in a traditional society, the framework, the intention, the set and setting would be a given. We are brought up in it, we already know to some extent what's going on, what's going to happen with these experiences, and they are organized and explained and integrate us, because we already have that map. We've grown up into it, it's in the background, and maybe the shaman is a technician of culture, aware of how to maintain that cultural reality to some degree, using things that are maybe not included in that cultural reality, even using tricks to maintain that perception for the tribe. But we don't have that option any more. So what do we do? What is our intention? What is the frame? What is the set and setting that we organize? These are very big questions.

THE CORPORATE STATE

How does the liminal role of psychedelics fit into our world in terms of policy, in terms of the law? It's interesting to look at the role of psychedelic culture within the larger picture of drugs as constructed by the state, or by the concurrent consensus reality. What interests me is that in some ways, it's not a bad thing. And I don't mean that to say that it's not bad that people are being incarcerated and having their lives ruined. Obviously major suffering goes down and I'm not talking about that. What I'm trying to say is that nonetheless, it puts psychedelic culture in a very curious place inside the larger cultural framework. It has some very productive qualities to it.

One of those is that it avoids some of the traps that occur with any sort of mainstream or corporate or state-oriented recuperation of psychoactive substances. This really came to me in an interesting way. I'm not entirely sure I believe myself on this one, but I do think it's an interesting issue to raise. When Rick Doblin [founder and president of MAPS] was talking about his plan to get MDMA made legal [at the Lindesmith Center-Drug Policy Foundation's "The State of Ecstasy" conference], it was a very sophisticated, very interesting plan. But when he was presenting it, at the end of his presentation he was casting his vision of these "Ecstasy clinics," where people would go and they would be legitimate, and you'd have nice paintings and everything would be set up, and you'd have these kind people who'd be helping you through these sorts of experiences. I kind of had this weird feeling inside. I had this little strange kind of shiver, of like, "Okay, but I don't know that that's all of it." And the reason I say that is that one of the things I think is going to happen - it's already happening, you see it all over the place - is this transformation of the corporate culture of psychoactivity and psychoactive drugs. If you look at Prozac, if you look at Ritalin, you see that there is a willingness inside of civilization or whatever you want to call this particular monster, to willingly use powerful psychoactive drugs in order to restore certain models of normal behavior, certain models of happiness, certain models of satisfaction. And there's nothing wrong with happiness or satisfaction. There's nothing wrong with recognizing profoundly dysfunctional behaviors and finding ways, even very technological ways, of overcoming those behaviors. Nonetheless, there is something that happens when those activities and those possibilities become incorporated into the state. And by the state, I don't just mean the government. I mean the kind of large corporate state that we live in. And so there's a profound difference between decriminalization and legalization. And we're not anywhere near a point where we're going to be able to deal with these things. At the moment, people are suffering and we have to fight that battle, and again I'm not talking about keeping things the way they are. But what I am talking about is that I don't think it's an accident that psychedelics occupy this curious position

MDMA is a very different category in a lot of ways. MDMA is operating again in a very liminal space, between the crazy world of psychedelics that must be suppressed - those wild and crazy kids, those nuts from California - and Prozac. So you start to see mainstream media going, "This stuff's not so bad!" The New York Times, Time magazine: "Hmm, you know, it's not that different from the serotonin-based SSRIs and such."  But one of the things about that is because Ecstasy by itself, though incredibly productive and marvelous in so many ways, does not puncture consensus reality the way psychedelics puncture consensus reality. And so I don't think it's an accident that it's in this zone, because in some ways you can imagine a reorganization of our current environment in which Ecstasy is somehow integrated. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just that as soon as you start to integrate it, then it becomes manipulated by that cultural machine, which has agendas that have nothing to do necessarily with you feeling better, with you discovering more love and intimacy in your life. It becomes a regulatory mechanism, a way of managing human subjectivity in an increasingly dense and chaotic and open-ended social environment.

So in some ways, psychedelics have a very interesting place because they're not integrated into that world. And for me, one of the things that is the most productive and full of potential about them is that they're going to puncture your consensus reality. They're going to knock you out of whatever that structure is, even in terms of your models of healing, even in terms of your models of deeper interconnection with nature. You think you're going to get the great earth momma embracing you in some kind of jaguar-rich forest, and you get sucked into some sort of interdimensional wormhole built by malevolent-looking insectoid creatures, and you go, "Man, I was going for the nature vibe sort of thing!" That's great. It's that pulling the rug out from under you. And so it's very interesting to look at the difference between MDMA and psychedelic culture in that sense.

RELIGION & SPIRITUALITY

The final zone I want to talk about in terms of this liminality is religion or spirituality. A good example of something analogous to where we are in terms of the role of psychedelics in our spiritual/religious quest today from history is to look at the mystery religions of late antiquity. Many people have drawn what I think are very valid connections between the last few centuries of the Roman Empire, and our world now. You have a potentially globalized environment full of huge varieties of different kinds of people, a sort of mechanized state that is very efficient but utterly corrupt at the top. You have a very urban environment, in which many different kinds of people are coming together, and people are pulled out of their tribal connections to the places they come from. There's a lot more movement in the empire. And it's in this environment that you see the rise of the mystery religions. Not particularly the famous mystery religion of Eleusis, which is a very important part of our psychedelic story, but was actually much older than most of these mystery religions. But it was more the sense that the way to serve this spiritual hunger was to enter into these cult sects, where at the heart of the whole operation was an experience, an otherworldly experience. And they were not by any means all produced by psychoactive substances; in fact, I don't think you necessarily need very much psychoactive substances involved in the production of these kinds of mystical experiences in order for them to be very heavy and transformative. And yet there was a desire for this kind of experience, for a sense of the self that went beyond the body, that was very similar to now. 

So it's interesting to think about how we relate to this model of the mystery religions. I see an unfortunate reductive tendency of some psychedelic research, particularly the historical stuff, to find behind all of these vast mysteries of religions across the globe some kind of substance that's "actually" producing things. We know there's something going on with soma, we know there's something going on with Eleusis, we know that stuff is going on, and there's little fragments of it here and there, and we want to reconstruct what is actually going on. In this way, we're very modern still. We're still looking for the mechanism. We're still looking for the actual substance that allows these things to be. It's my belief that once you take into account the way that cultural reality can program or set up a certain set of expectations, a certain set of experiences, then you actually don't need many chemicals thrown into the mix in order to produce a tremendously powerful experience, and I always find it unfortunate when in some psychedelic historiography, it's almost saying, "Real spirituality is the psychedelic experience, and everything else we see is a pale reflection of it, some attempt to recapture it using some longer, slower, more painful method, or leaving aside the methods, you just have some crusty, dogmatic ideology that is the leftover of this living spiritual experience." I mean, in some ways I think that's probably an accurate description in a lot of respects, but I think it also misses a lot, and one of the things it does is it cuts against our willingness to look at what those cultural frameworks are, what the stories are that are embedded in these experiences. By overly emphasizing the "secret mushroom" behind all of the iconography or all of the lore, I think we tend to undercut the role of meaning, the role of our ongoing cultural frameworks in producing these experiences.

Another issue that's raised by the mystery religions is the larger question about what is the role of experience spiritually in the first place? There's a fairly consensus idea that we have spirituality over here, we have religion over there, and they kind of overlap. Spirituality on whatever level is about your experiences: what's actually happening, how you're becoming more integrated, your mystical experiences, the real deal, the immediacy of spirit. Whereas religion we tend to associate very justly with institutional frameworks, with collective stories, with power relations, with manifest social relationships. And there's this curious sort of balance between the two. What you have with a traditional mystery religion is that at the heart of it, there is something like gnosis. Maybe it's produced through a substance, maybe not. But there is an experience, a profound experience of the divine, of the otherworldly. And yet, again, it is embedded in this whole set of stories and frameworks, which a) help produce the shape of those experiences, and b) even more importantly, help integrate the residue of those experiences into ordinary life. 

So there's a tendency, a very strong one and very understandable, inside of psychedelic spirituality, to say, "This stuff is getting us to the goods, now we can skip all that 'religion' stuff and get right to the heart of it. We can go spiritual, we don't need religion in the broadest and most positive sense of the word." But I'm not entirely sure that that sums up the issue, because again I think without a certain kind of framework for understanding and integrating, then the spiritual experience, even the most profound state of gnosis, can become a kind of wacky hedonism. Nothing wrong with hedonism. But you probably people know people like this, or you can see it in the culture very much, where any kind of substance that you're taking in a de-mythologized environment where you're buying a piece of blotter or you're taking a pill, however you try to frame it, it can become just a mechanistic repetition. It can lose any edge of genuine openness and integration. 

But I don't have an answer for this, because I don't know what these frames are. I don't know what the big maps are. I tend to be very distrustful of people who know what the big map is. They "know" what the story is that's organizing these experiences. We can see, for example, if you look at some Brazilian ayahuasca sects, there are some very interesting things that are happening there from a religious anthropology perspective. And yet, it doesn't take much interaction with them to see things that at least from a Western perspective are difficult: institutional hierarchies, ways of saying what's a good experience, what's a bad experience, what is the meaning of all this, and answering those questions beforehand becomes somewhat authoritarian in a traditional religious way. So it can have a great deal of social power and actually aid people in a lot of ways, and yet I think a lot of us in psychedelic culture are uncomfortable with that. So once again this is that "in betwixt, in between": we know there are frames, we know that by accepting and creating a spiritual environment, a spiritual story, the experiences themselves will have a much greater richness. (I mean, sometimes they'll just come in and do whatever they're going to do anyway, but that is very much a part of it.) And yet, what is our frame? What really is the story we're telling ourselves? I don't have an answer for that, but it fascinates me very much that there is something to the need to produce these cultural frameworks. 

And I'm not sure whether the kinds of frameworks that we have so far are sufficient. If you look at them, what are the two main ones you can talk about? One of them is the therapeutic model. Again, incredibly productive, and yet I'm not always so sure whether that is getting at the real heart of the spiritual potential of these molecules. Another example is rave culture. That's probably the best example of a kind of mass movement with a great deal of cultural power, within which people are having tremendous psychoactive experiences, and which is organized in a certain way to produce trance effects, to suggest certain kinds of images which are keying off archetypes, the drugs really plug into the music and the music plugs into the drugs, as an example of the way that technology and the drug states are really mirroring each other and as they evolve, they sort of co-create these environments. Again, they're incredibly rich and productive in some ways, and yet in other ways I don't think you have to be too much of a worrywart to look at some aspects of rave culture, and wonder, what are they doing? What is this for? What's going on here? There's always that tendency, particularly in our culture, to have things turned into a form of entertainment or a form of numbing yourself. 

And so the question I always ask myself is: How can you communicate the best aspects of "psychedelic values"? There are certain kinds of psychedelic values that many people develop after a long apprenticeship with these things. I mean, I know I've met individuals from older generations, and there's just certain things you pick up, a certain kind of openness, a certain kind of tolerance, a certain kind of sweetness, a certain kind of mirth that really strikes me as part of these values. They're almost unspoken. How do you transmit these? Is there a way to transmit them? Is it all just out of control? As soon as you start to try to control it, then you make it more like religion, you make it more like "this is the right way and this is the wrong way." And yet, in some ways the chaotic effects of introducing these things at an increasingly mass level are worrying. 

So again, I don't have a lot of answers. But I really just wanted to paint a big picture, throwing out some questions that I know will be approached from a variety of different ways within our culture. Of course, one of the good things about the old mystery religions and that kind of model is that they're esoteric. There's levels of secrecy. And so in order to work yourself up to the encounter, the experience, you have to go through a lot of social machinery, a lot of preparation, a lot of preparing yourself for not really necessarily knowing what goes on. And that structure also allows the production of wisdom people, whether you call them shamans, whether you call them masters, whatever you want to call people who know their stuff, who know these worlds inside and out, but there's a way that that knowledge passes on. There's apprentices, and those apprentices are able to reproduce those environments, changing them always slightly as the culture itself transforms. Now we're in an information environment, where that kind of hermeticism still goes on, and it's vital that it does go on - most secret elite pockets are vital to the continual creation of this culture and its encounters with psychoactives. But it's also the case that the genie is seriously out of the bottle. It's much easier in some senses to "get" things, to pluck on the information networks and come up with a lot of very powerful information, that in a more traditional society would be highly guarded by the wacky alchemists, the witch at the edge of the village. Now it's all open. That raises some really interesting ethical issues.

184 30 shakatura01 Trip 8 Extra Shakatura Interview Galen Butler talks about his first CD release under the name Shakatura James Kent <b>TRIP</b>: So who is Shakatura? Is it just one person?

<b>GB</b>: Shakatura is a thread in the magik carpet of Bay Area musicians, artists, dancers, activists and healers committed to raising a positive vibe for anyone in range. It is an artistic costume worn primarily by Galen Butler but shared among various musical and artistic collaborators. It was conjured and is being developed as a magikal mainline to the healing powers of music and dance.

<b>TRIP</b>: How long have you been making music?

<b>GB</b>: My earliest musical memory is of playing a kid's drum covered with dayglo orange funfur at about age 5. This was a clear sign of how things would unfold later. Guitar came into the picture during high school and there was much epic psy-fi noodling and whiteboy jambalaya in subsequent years. A computer-based studio started taking shape in 1996. The idea of painting
with a limitless digital palette of sounds really appealed to me in a way that no single traditional instrument ever had. It was like my imagination had finally found it's native tool.

In 1998, I was playing guitar and electronics in a SF-based rock project called Dreamspy. This band was a sort of initial run at fusing the kind of acid and progressive rock we'd cut our teeth on with contemporary electronic textures and dance floor punch. It was a tall order, one which the band didn't survive long enough to fill, though we were pointed in the right direction. This sort of "organic-electronic" live dance band concept is still a vision of mine. In the Bay Area, acts like Sound Tribe Sector 9, Lost at Last and Medicine Drum, among others, are honing different spins on this idea.

<b>TRIP</b>: What first inspired you to make this particular CD?

<b>GB</b>: I moved to California from New England in 1996 and became immediately submerged in San Francisco's dance music culture, especially the psychedelic trance scene. The color and energy of this music really absorbed me for a good three or four years. In parallel, artists like Mixmaster Morris, Adham Shaikh and Simon Posford were releasing some beautifully sophisticated ambient dub music that was really accessing beautiful and powerful spaces. So as I started putting tracks together, I suppose they landed somewhere on the periphery of these immediate influences. I wanted to make an album that had dance floor elements and lush headphone appeal as well. Within the electro-funk-dub stylistic mishmash on the album, there's something for the body, something for the mind, something for the spirit; that kind of thing.

It's a wonderful thing when music can effect people on different levels and really open the whole organism. This is what I'm trying to do with music - open up and let it pour though from the highest and funkiest and most healing sources available.

<b>TRIP</b>: What gear/software did you use to create the tracks on Shakatura?

<b>GB</b>: The music on the first CD came together gradually at the stormy confluence of sonic inspiration and technical pro wrestling. The studio was in serious flux over the course of the album's production. A lot of vintage analog synths and a bunch of newer digital synths and samplers were involved. The production environment used on Shakatura was Steinberg's Cubase VST on a Macintosh. I haven't played a synthesizer I like more than the Access Virus B for range and sound quality. I use a EMu rack module as a Swiss army knife of drum sounds and samples. A Studio Electronics ATC-1 serves up the pure analog butter and cream.

Of course it helps tremendously to play a traditional instrument, and have friends who play instruments. Electronic music has created a range of new musical aesthetics that completely discard any traditional instrumental tones and ensembles we're used to hearing in favor of a completely synthetic sound. Personally, I'm into fusion and integration of electronic and traditional instrumentation and I think this comes across on the album.

Seems to me that, beyond the basics, one's choice of particular tools is not as important as one's understanding of them. The computer is the heart of any digital composition system, acting as multi track recorder, sampler, synthesizer, drum machine, and mastering suite. With an average personal computer and a single good synthesizer, the only limitations are time, imagination, and patience.



<b>TRIP</b>: Did you use many samples or was the sound all homegrown?

<b>GB</b>: All the synth sounds were generated in the studio. Some of the samples come from sample disc libraries made for the purpose, some come from field DAT recordings, some from experimental goofing around. Everything audible is fair game if you can record it. This album does not really go as far as I'd like to eventually in terms of mining the world's technosphere and biosphere for interesting sounds. The album is about 85% an electronic studio creation, and it sounds like it. Moving forward, each track and definitely each album release will bump the ceiling of complexity. It has to be this way to stay interesting.

<b>TRIP</b>: What do you call the type of music on this album? Trip house? Organic downtempo? Murky disco? How would you classify it?

<b>GB</b>: Murky disco? A new sub-genre is born! Friends of mine were kicking around the term "psy-hop" a few years ago to describe a fusion of psychedelic trance and hip-hop. This term was describing something super fat and funky; something equally trippy but not as morose or jazzy as a lot of trip hop. The name game is endless of course, especially when you're mixing genres. The music on Shakatura pulls from downtempo electronic, ambient, breakbeat, trance, house, funk, disco, and rock. If there's one thing that's truly unique about it, I'd say it's this stylistic fusion.

<b>TRIP</b>: What's your favorite track on the album and why?

<b>GB</b>: That's a tough one, because I've liked them all best at one time or another. The opening track, "Lava Tube," I think best captures the lush and colorful spirit that surrounded this project. "Quark" is a nice one too. "Playa Mimosa," which opens, by the way, with a field recording from post-burn chaos at Burning Man 2001, will be remixed on the next album. That was the last track made, and the one pointing the direction into the current work.

<b>TRIP</b>: What other CDs are you listening to right now? Got any tips for us?

<b>GB</b>: In my opinion, anything on Interchill Records is really the top of the stack as far as organic-electronic ambient music goes. There are two new compilations coming out on this label within the next few months, and based on the prospective track listings, I'd recommend them both. Meditation2 is also forthcoming on Ceiba Records and will be great as well. There's a little list of enduring releases on the website at <a href="http://www.shakatura.com">shakatura.com</a> in the music section.

<b>TRIP</b>: So you did the cover art for the album as well. It's pretty inspired. You've got some sort of Vedic calendrical mandala, a strand of DNA, pristine rainforests, sacred eye portals... What's going on here?

<b>GB</b>: Well, if you've worked with the Tarot at all, that's how I think about this image. It's a sort of mandala, an integrated collection of symbols which reflect related aspects of the psyche in a (hopefully) meaningful way. As this image was coming together, it became apparent that it was representing the level at which human identity is balanced within the earth's biosphere. The lunar/astrological calendar reminds us that the motion of time is a concert of energy, made of meaning, ultimately beyond cause and effect; that everything is tightly wound in a web of synchronicity on all levels. We can develop awareness of events as synchronic and work with this understanding: in music, in relationships, in work of any kind. The DNA spiral represents the unbroken evolutionary chain and the energetic distillery of life on this planet. It is the single organism differentiated into myriad shapes. When we feel this relationship on a cellular level, a tree or bacteria is literally "another Yourself." The waters, forests and sky represent the interpenetrating levels of the biosphere inhabited by and maintained by this DNA creatrix. The moth wings with floating eyes represent lunar vision, the ability to view and integrate unconscious psychic contents and transhuman energies through fearless interior exploration. The central eye, which is the eye of a human infant, represents transparent vision, the pure unencumbered state of witness to existence, gracefully embodying all potentials. The music sounds really good from this vantage point ;-).

185 30 shakatura Trip 8 Shakatura a groovin' head trip through lush organic downtempo James Kent One artist who fits the image of the modern psychedelic Renaissance man is
San Francisco's Galen Butler, also known as Shakatura. Butler recently released
an eponymous titled debut from Shakatura on Ceiba Records, and it is probably
one of my favorite albums of the year. Grooving with an organic house vibe from
start to finish, Shakatura booms and rolls with lush bass lines, phat breaks,
and swirling synths that bloom and sting with simultaneous hints of Eros and
menace.

While moving through various downtempo moods and spaces Shakatura steps and
swings along with ease, always maintaining an entirely chilled out demeanor,
unafraid to get comfortable in a specific zone and just roll with the flow for a
while. Yet within the meaty grooves lie the deep processes of time passing,
planets spinning, life evolving, each bathed in the ever-present
electro-harmonic radiance that ties it all together. Even when sober there are
parts of Shakatura that leave me envisioning the elegant dance of intracellular
process, the tiny wet machinery of life metabolizing through time at the
bio-molecular level. It is a soothing yet endlessly fascinating pulse, flowing
and combusting along with the organic groove of life. And if your booty stays
still while listening to it you are probably dead.

Although shakatura is hard to classify it is very easy to listen to. It embraces
the best aspects of both downtempo and beatless ambient spaces into tight
organic grooves that keep pumping, moving, and rolling to the end. The entire
album swings with consistent breakbeat chill and trippy soundscapes, and will
definitely enjoy heavy rotation on your sound system.

186 30 duckapus Trip 8 pfly, duckapus experimental ambient spaces, a journey of the mind James Kent One of the greatest things about the psychedelic community is the wide variety
of unique do-it-yourself artists and musicians who populate the scene. Holistic
artists like these typify the values of the renaissance creators, blending
philosophy, technology, music, and art into a tidy package of alchemical sound
and vision, handily compatible with any home CD player and guaranteed to
stimulate any set of eyes and ears the planet.

One such renaissance musician is pfly, also known as Paul Fly. pfly has been
producing underground ambient and experimental tracks for years now, but with
Duckapus, his latest release, he has taken the art form to a new level. Every
snippet of sound on this CD was assembled from the ground up by Fly, mixed and mastered in his own home studio. Even the curiously
enfractaled art on the CD sleeve comes from his desktop, making the entire
package a start-to-finish holographic representation of pfly's head space.

Duckapus is a very strange and unique album, moving through lush organic spaces,
squeaking dissociative noise machinery, and churning caverns of dark mystical
power, each one bubbling over with the potential to explode into states of pure
chaos at any moment. The mind states flow seamlessly from one to other, some
leaving you in the warm folds of sonic bliss, others sending you spiraling into
darkness, others spinning your awareness forty-five degrees in space while
simultaneously giving your light vehicle a two-and-a-half minute lube and tune.

Whether you're being pounded by hammers of insanity or washed over with
electro-harmonic love plasma, the great joy of this album is never knowing where
you're going to end up next. Some transitions are organic and exotic, others
creep out of nowhere and take control, others pass you through hellish corridors
of torment before alighting you into a field of fresh wild flowers at sunrise.
Duckapus leaves you with the sensation that a grand dreamlike voyage has been
undertaken, a skittering surreal journey through the many joys and pains of
existence. Duckapus is also an immaculately crafted album, each passage deep and
complex with simultaneous unfolding and enfoldment of mood and sound. In short
it is a production tour de force, and certainly has the depth to listen to over
and over again, always discovering new glittering snippets and pieces, like tiny
polished gems awash in a great ocean of sound.

609 30 signal_theory Psychedelic Information Theory Signal Theory Overview A technical overview of Signal Theory, a new model of consciousness proposed by James Kent James Kent Signal Theory presents a new model for objectively measuring expanded states of consciousness based on neural firing rate, synchrony of neural spiking, and intensity of signal feedback recursion occurring within the sensory processing circuits of neocortex. Signal Theory also proposes methodologies for mathematically modeling the action of psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonists in the production of diminished, amplified, and standing sensory feedback loops in simple neural circuits. Using the basic tenets of Signal Theory, we can describe an empirical model in which both normal waking consciousness and expanded psychedelic consciousness can be defined.

1200 34 1200 www.cdreviews.com CD review: Lewis Taylor - Stoned Lewis Taylor has an interesting story. A modern psychedelic soul singer and producer dedicated to the themes of love and obsession; his one-man compositions likened to past and modern greats like Stevie Wonder, Justin Timberlake, and Prince; and a temperment so moody he is in and out of the music business two times in as many decades leaving little but lauding critical praise and confused fans in his wake?

This may sound like just another "Behind the Music" episode, but listen to Taylor's music (you can find tracks on his Hacktone and MySpace pages listed below) and you realize it is the work of an obsessive perfectionist dedicated to getting his sound just right.

From a recent review on CDReviews.com:

<blockquote>Possibly one of the best pure soul records of the last decade comes from an artist hardly no one has heard about. At least, not on this side of the pond anyway. In England, where Taylor is from, it may be another matter, though he is more of an underground cult star there than an established name.  At one time a guitarist in a revived version of the Edgar Broughton Band in the mid '80's, Taylor would eventually succumb to the temptations of the road and would vanish for a while, mired in a nasty drug and alcohol haze that consumed his career. But not before he released two great psychedelic rock albums under the pseudonym Sheriff Jack. These albums sank without a trace, and Taylor proceeded to vanish for better part of a decade.</blockquote>

His latest US release, <i>Stoned</i> (part one, there is a part two, just not available in the states yet), is not a return to form as much as a perfection of the form Taylor has been striving for all these years away from the spotlight. A right meloncholy wanker prone to fits of solitude and depression, Taylor ranks right up there with Brian Wilson, Nick Drake, and Elliot Smith in the cannon of self-destructive musical geniuses. He's so tempermental that his official website now says he has "retired" from the music business despite being named one of the best artists to watch by Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, and many others who should know. His music makes you feel good, sad, comforted, disturbed, all at the same time. Hauntingly poppy magic, nostalgia in a bottle, so rich and warm I just can't explain. 

While somewhat inconsistent personally, Taylor's music continues to be simultaneously entrancing, cheesy, poppy, emotionally manipulative, clever, and almost always about the ups and downs (mostly downs) of the that thing we call love. Go to Hacktone.com and listen to some more of his tracks and you will hear his anguished soul shine though. Seriously, this man is <i>deep</i>. http://www.cdreviews.com/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=1746&Itemid=27 0 0 0 0 groovy downtempo psychedelic soul music 1 1 jamesk 2007-02-20 21:49:53 2007-02-21 21:04:44 jamesk 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 12 2008-08-13 09:39:20

<blockquote>A SEVEN-MONTH-OLD girl is stable in hospital after reportedly swallowing an ecstasy tablet.

The baby's condition was originally described as critical after paramedics picked her up from Gravesend High Street at 7pm yesterday.</blockquote>

Now people, how many times have I told you? Don't leave your stash where babies will find it, they'll put anything in their mouths!

1208 40 Scot45dbcc01a1549 www.ketv.com 'He was high.  He was high.' Apparently people are still occasionally taking PCP and freaking right the hell out:

<blockquote>Zina Ventry said her son had to go by ambulance to a local hospital after he suffered severe frostbite while he was high.

“He came over and flipped out and that's when we knew he was on PCP,” she said. “He was butt naked. He'd been outside with no clothes on for 45 minutes.”

A police report shows that on that day, Robert Vintry had torn off the hair on the right side of his mother's head and smeared his own feces all over his body.

“He was high,” Zina Vintry said. “He was high.”</blockquote>

You don't say.

Later that day, police received reports of a crazy person going door to door with a knife.  When the cops caught up to the 20-year-old, they wound up killing him.  

I guess everyone fights boredom in their own fashion.  For instance:

<blockquote>Suzanne Nord, the clinical director at NOVA -- a drug treatment center in north Omaha -- evaluates people on PCP in jail. She said that on Thursday afternoon, she talked to two teenage boys who had done PCP.

"He and his friends would intentionally smoke this so they could go out and shoot people," Nord said.</blockquote>

They probably only did that when there was no good TV on, but still. http://www.ketv.com/news/10972024/detail.html?rss=oma&psp=news 0 0 0 0 PCP 1 1 Scotto 2007-02-20 22:38:51 2007-02-20 22:38:51 Scotto 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 10 2008-08-13 09:39:21

2262 59 omgo465bb50217c17 www.promicininfo.com The 4400 I live under a rock, so I might just be the last person to find out about this, but I just came across some promotional web sites for a show from a few years back called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4400">The 4400.</a>  Central to the plot is a drug called promicin which, when injected, sometimes gives people superhero powers.  The linked site is a promotional tie-in for the show; it appears to be an up-to-date blog allegedly describing the experiences of people who took the drug and developed powers.  If you are into that sort of thing, you might get a kick out of it, and the other related sites.  The show doesn't appear all that original to me; sort of "Heroes" meets "X-men 3" but probably not as good as either.  Not that I would know.

It appears the sites just went up this month.  I have no idea why, considering the show has been running since 2004. http://www.promicininfo.com/ 0 0 0 0 television show promotion promicin 4400 0 1 omgoleus 2007-05-29 00:10:02 2007-05-29 00:10:02 omgoleus 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 8 2008-08-01 18:07:54

2264 40 2264 news.yahoo.com Whitney Museum gets people high The Whitney Museum in NYC is staging some kind of Summer of Love retrospective, featuring "posters, artwork, light shows, trippy album covers and experimental film from a counter-cultural movement that brought together peace activists, musicians, hippies and artists."  That all sounds fantastic.  But get a load of some of the PR they're trying to push:

<blockquote>"You can experience the 60s and what it might have been taking LSD without actually having to resort to the drug," [curator Christoph Grunenberg] said.</blockquote>

Riiiiiiight.  Yeah, boy, <i>that</i> will sure bring in the commoners.  You'll get whole field trips from teenagers who are ready to push past DXM and, given their lack of an actual acid connection, think that the Whitney might actually do the trick.  Seriously, they're honestly pushing this kind of thing:

<blockquote>"What I think this exhibition hopefully will do is provide intense experiences," he said. "I think that's a critical element of psychedelic art -- the intense experiences."</blockquote>

And what do these intense experiences actually entail?

<blockquote>The exhibition includes several darkened rooms playing light shows of trippy psychedelic patterns and gently rising lava lamp-style swirls, to a soundtrack of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles.</blockquote>

OMG!!!  Why, I own a lava lamp TOO!  I am SO getting super high this weekend!  I mean, I have to pick up a Jimi Hendrix record from CD Warehouse, but then, MAN, I am gonna get WASTED! http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070529/lf_afp/entertainmentusartmusic_070529034625 0 0 0 0 summer of love, whitney museum, LSD 1 1 Scotto 2007-05-29 00:43:56 2007-05-29 00:51:19 Scotto 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 15 2008-08-03 15:53:23

2268 40 Scot465c2f52c0b10 www.washingtonpost.com All your prescribing is belong to us Here's something I didn't know: 

<blockquote>The American Medical Association... makes millions of dollars each year by helping data-mining companies link prescribing data to individual physicians. It does so by licensing access to the AMA Physician Masterfile, a database containing names, birth dates, educational background, specialties and addresses for more than 800,000 doctors.</blockquote>

What's the end result of all this data mining?  Physicians are now bombarded with information about the utility of new drugs on the market versus drugs they've been comfortable prescribing up until then.  Indeed, companies with competing drugs on the market can be spurred to make sure your doctor gets the latest and greatest data about his preferred drug's side effects, while at the same time learning all about the benefits of a competitor - and maybe get a nice dinner out of it at the same time.  In some cases doctors are mostly being influenced to start prescribing a drug that is more expensive, not necessarily more effective.

Naturally this is squicking some doctors out, but the opt-out for this program is under-advertised and only lasts three years.  Some states are attempting to pass laws, but so far, legislation has failed on grounds like "you can't restrict free speech."  And in theory, it may not be all bad:

<blockquote>The more a drug representative knows about a physician, the easier it is to provide information that meets the needs of the doctor's practice... "We are about more information and more education, and not less....The vast majority of physicians welcome these people as part of the overall educational process about drugs and their use. And any doctor in the country can close the door to these sales reps. It doesn't require legislation to do that."</blockquote>

Painting the whole situation as "the overall educational process about drugs" seems a little bit quaint, as though this isn't actually "the overall sales and marketing process," but I quibble.  You can imagine cases where this atmosphere actually, if not almost inadvertently, creates some benefits for patients; just as easily, it sounds like a surreptitious drug bazaar where doctors are bombarded with competing messages, and only the company that has the best schwag will truly make an impression on patient care. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/21/AR2007052101701.html 0 0 0 0 big pharma, medical care 0 1 Scotto 2007-05-29 08:51:29 2007-05-29 08:51:29 Scotto 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 5 2008-08-01 18:07:54

<blockquote>Oregonians consume more alcohol than the national average, live in a state that ranks fourth nationwide for alcohol-related deaths, and have a drug-mortality rate that's been double the U.S. average for five years in a row. 

And the state is not just grappling with overintoxicated adults. The data show that Oregon eighth- and 11th-graders are more likely to smoke marijuana than smoke cigarettes, and the percentage of eighth-graders who said they drank alcohol in the previous 30 days was 76 percent higher than the national average. </blockquote>

Well, all I can say is this people: If we can get Oregon tweens and teens to turn away from big tobacco and start supporting local hemp, then we're doing something right here. Give yourselves all a high five. This is a moral victory for indie drug culture. The kids of Oregon have spoken; big tobacco is out. Pot is the new cool. http://blog.oregonlive.com/breakingnews/2007/05/data_show_high_drug_and_alcoho.html 0 0 0 0 1 1 jamesk 2007-05-29 21:14:29 2007-05-29 21:14:29 jamesk 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 4 2008-08-01 18:07:54

120 1918 129 papalaterreur 2007-04-21 19:10:51 Mystical...atheist...spiritual...scientist...so many words...
The entheogen experience is highly inneffable and trying to put it in words is out of reach.
I personally encountered Jeremy (a french canadian, like me, who is now in switzerland) and Benny in Basel LSD event, back in january 2006 and I can say, from my personnal feeling, that Jeremy is a lot more 'spiritual' type of man than Benny. 
Benny, a VERY rational mind, is a university teacher and his approach  
is simple...take it, compile a lot of experiences, and write...draw the cartography of the Ayahuasca 'territory'..and, then...try to explain the Experience.
It can be a wonderful and very rewarding adventure but, from my point of view, the Jeremy's  approach,although it is more 'scientific' in his essence,  provides a radically new, and refreshing, vision of the entheogen phenomena. It can shed light on A LOT of insight experienced by generations of fellow psychonauts around the globe. 
Both books are eminently interesting but very differents. Benny's one is a lot more hard to read and gives a complete visit of the 'territory'.
Jeremy's book is short (+- 160 pages) and present a THEORY surrounding the entheogen phenomena...
Personally, I think that his theory is right in the 'bull's eye'...simply because it is...simple and elegant!
Moreover, it put a bridge between biology(dna), photonic (light and the relativity theory)), mythology (the double-serpent as THE FIRST LOGO OF HUMANITY), evolution (the presence of DMT in the pineal gland) and so on..
It is simply TOO NICE!!!
Life is SACRED. It is a GIFT.
The Entheogen Experience is Sacred and will, forever, remain a Mystery. Like it or not.
Jeremy's theory show the way to look at. Light, knowledge and consciousness are intrisically interwoven and leads to the birth of what we called 'REALITY' and LIFE gives us, through the DNA vector, the opportunity to be...ALIVE AND CONSCIOUS.
We are all GOD....but most of us do not remember it.
The entheogen experience is precisely there to remember it to each one who wish to. And Ayahuasca is probably the most 'pure' of all the different types of entheogens.

This sounds like handwaving w/ sciencey-sounding terms thrown in.  See... how?  As in ayahuasca allows our eyes to pick up wavelengths or something that they don't normally?  As in our visual cortex is 'picking something up" that it wouldn't normally, and it doesn't come via the eyes?  What is exactly is a 'photonic resonance'?

552 3335 64 Aumdoc 2007-10-02 07:30:19 I have experience administering atropine/scopolamine injections for nicotine addiction.  I took the job at the clinic two days a month to make some additional income.  I found out about the clinic because my dear friend, S, was successful quitting smoking through the clinic.  I had watched S literally torment himself for 2 years trying to quit smoking.  Every method he could try he did... patches, zyban, coldturkey... all without success.  It wasn't really his trying to quit that got to me, it was more the self recrimination when he failed.

S has quite an interest in plants, especially those with a history of psychotropic human interaction.  Among the many cactii on his back deck there are many tree datura's in pots with beautiful trumpet flowers.  He loves those plants.  To both him and I it seems no small coincidence that he ended up quitting using alkaloids found in these plants (and others as well, brugmansia & jimson weed come to mind).  He was assisted by his plant allies.

Whenever one reads about "recreational (!?!)" use of these plants on erowid, the reports almost always end with uncontrolled bizarre behavior that usually calls the attention of authorities.  Dosing from the plant source is very unpredictable and overdosing seems common with trouble that follows.  These plants are used in indiginous shamanic settings as admixtures in ayahuasca or smoking mixtures.  I think the indiginous shamans have a better handle on how to use them than the average American drug user.

I was so impressed by S's success that when I needed a few days extra work each month I contacted the clinic.  Now S kids me about shooting 'Datura Darts'.  In this therapy the individual is screened medically (history and physical, ekg, pulmonary function tests) to make sure they are a safe candidate for the therapy.  They then receive injection therapy, with specific weight based doses of atropine and scopolamine, to provide anticholinergic effects on nicotine receptors.  Once processed through the clinic (they watch video's and receive behavioral counseling) they continue scopolamine and atropine orally for 2 weeks.

We discuss that these are not new medications and have been and are used in many different ways in medicine.

Patients routinely have a 'big experience' with the shots.... meaning the feel something..... ("ooooooooooooo this must be powerful medicine if it makes me feel this way")... I can't help but feel this has something to do with the effectiveness of the method.  I tell people what to expect from the shots...." you may feel dizzy or lightheaded and off balance; your pupils will dilate making lights bright and it difficult to focus (like coming out of the eye doctors); you will have a very dry mouth; it is most common for people to be sedated and fall asleep on the ride home; it is very common for people to describe feeling stoned, drunk or intoxicated.  Some people like it and some don't.  Often times people look drunk as they walk out of the clinic.

I have been doing this since march, 2 days a month, and am amazed at how many people stop smoking who have been unable to do so over a lifetime.  I do not have this years numbers yet (success rates from the clinics follow up) but feel it will be more than 50%.  People describe a loss of craving immediately.  This is a clinic situation who will take anyone who pays and passes the medical screening.  I don't think all these people are really ready to quit and I feel that is an important part of success.  With establishment of more clear screening guidelines I think it would be even more effective.

The effects are very predictable using the weight based dosing schedule.  I have not had any problems with psychotropic or other medical adverse reactions.  Yes, some people have some 'unusual' experiencI as they describe to me, but nothing untoward.  Older individuals (>60 y/o) also seem to tolerate the treatment.

I have spent six months connecting to the Datura's in my yard and spending time using plant material at very very low dose to try to further connect with the beneficial effects of Datura Darts.  I always comment to patients that these are not new medicine's and in fact the plants these chemicals come from were used as medicine long before there were doctors.

556 3350 193 sean 2007-10-02 15:43:31 This comment might meander...but then, no one is really obligated to read on, anyway. I feel that this situation will get worse and worse and worse until people wake up to the real issues, on both sides of the problem. I mean to say, until people realize the truth about Altered States and the truth about the Drug War...and I'm not putting any label on those "truths", simply saying that it is NOT where we're at now. Some people are making solid definitions that are based on morality, reasoning and experience (which is the apex of importance in this case, and so often the crux of misunderstanding...this brings forth my "favorite" adjunct to the Drug War: people who've never had any experience with Altered States, labeling the nature and the safety of these states...), but the overarching social trends and this "War on Drugs" we find ourselves within seems to be pretty mindless, fear based and engendered by controlling and manipulative individuals/organizations. I live in Canada, and like most Countries (I would assume all Countries which impose such Drug Laws wear this fa??ade...), my Government assumes to tell me that the Drug Laws they impose are STRICTLY for my safety. They have only my best interests in mind, and they wouldn't want me to expose myself to something potentially dangerous. That's very nice of them, you know? There are many daaaangerous things out there, and I just can't imagine what would happen if I were left to my own devices. If you'd like to believe that Fairy-Tale and accept that this is what they truly design when contemplating Drug Scheduling, then we're faced with a very serious inconsistency. It's so obvious that I'm sure we've all recognized it, but it's such a great example of the true intentions, and therefore the rhetorical and practical hypocrisy, behind Drug Scheduling and Governmental control of a Populations exposure to Altered States that I have to bring it up. If our safety is of the utmost import, why can I so readily walk to any Gas Station, Corner Store, Supermarket and any other variety of places, and buy a 25 pack of pre-rolled, chemically-treated Tobacco cigarettes? I know this is a really touchy subject, and I'm not talking about removing any persons "right" to buy a pack of cigarettes, or to access the plants and plant products (or chemical substances, or what-have-you, you know fill in the blank, haha) of their choice, I'm just talking about the skin-and-bones logic behind the fact that Tobacco, in it's current market offering of the "Machine Processed Cigarette" is legal and taxed, whereas MANY substances which have measurably lower toxicity and health risks (and when I say measurably, I really mean that this isn't even the same game we're playing...the sort of health risks associated with cigarettes are so direct and so Bodily...) are not only Scheduled, but sought out and destroyed, their advocates either forced into hiding their passion or paying for it by serving out time in Prison. So no matter what you want to say about the health risks of other plants and substances, there is this very obvious contradiction of Tobacco being so studied and well understood as being toxic and damaging yet still being legal...especially when you compare that sort of toxicity with some of the plants or substances which are Scheduled. 

Take Psilocybin mushrooms, for instance. By and large the toxicity of Psilocybin mushrooms, and certainly the toxicity of Psilocybin or Psilocin themselves, is really non-existent. What I mean is that the body load, the damage induced by processing the chemicals and the long term stress on your system (not to mention the LACK of Cancer causing agents...) is astronomically lower with Psilocybin mushrooms than with Tobacco. Yet if you were to endeavor, even once, to imbibe just a single Psilocybin mushroom, and even if you were filled with moral, reasonable or perhaps spiritual intention, and approached the situation with the utmost respect and openness for what the Altered State might present to you, you are invariably considered a criminal. The context is therefore not important, not whatsoever. I'm not saying this new Altered State (the example of the Psilocybin mushroom) is without dangers...what we have to admit is that everything has some potential for harm and once you acknowledge this, you invariably begin approaching things with respect. Isn't that healthier? Respect, not fear...just respect. Understanding how something might affect you, what you're opening yourself up to, and how you can go about it with the most caution and safety, if it is indeed something you must do at all...in my opinion, this attitude is miles away from one built on fear and out of habit, without personal knowledge but merely based on social pre-definition of these States and Substances. So, yes, Psilocybin surely would carry its own set of dangers, but in my strong yet hopefully humble opinion, when they are held up to the set of dangers which Tobacco (esp. in the Modern preparation) carries, the notion that these Schedules are "strictly for our safety" is truly laughable. Well, it would be if it weren't such a terrible reality, causing so much suffering. It's the most incredibly ironic situation, so much that it might be funny if it weren't so unbelievably awful and tragic. The ruling Western mentality is one dominated by the obsession with verifiable evidence, of Science (the narrow branch of scientific thought which both depends and insists on measurability and "empirical" evidence). Within this thought system, some great minds in many (especially, obviously, Medical) fields that take up this obsession with measuring datum and performing experiments and so forth give very convincing arguments that Tobacco, especially delivered in such a convenient, easy to inhale, and chemically-treated formula, is incredibly dangerous, and DOES increase the likelihood of Cancer and does degenerate your body and does cause an incredibly strong, physical, mental, and I would certainly argue social/cultural addiction. So...you know, it's all so mind baffling that I feel myself losing steam, just thinking about this. All that I can hold on to is that it's simply not possible that the Government is only looking out for my best interests. If that were true, hey, maybe they still wouldn't let me access some of the things I would like to be able to access safely and legally, and that's not good news, but IF it were true then we wouldn't see this inequity that we clearly (or at least I clearly) do see. I don't want Tobacco to be struck down, made illegal and removed from the hands of people. I want honesty, and I think that's all that we can hope for. This Drug War is nothing but suppression, we have yet to deal with the true nature and importance of Altered States in our Modern, "civilized" culture and we externalize our suppression of these issues by fighting against them physically...but that will never, ever make this go away. That's not where the problem is; it's not in the plants or the substances themselves. The problem is the attitudes that surround them, the contexts which they have been forced into by legislation, historical misconception (often judgments about other cultures integration of and focus upon Altered States have been made through Racist, Colonial, Superiority Complex based perspectives) and social propaganda which is as unflagging as the outward violent attempts at drug and populace control which we label "The Drug War". 

The way I often rationalize this situation is to look at our culture as a comprehensive Being, and therefore to envision the Drug War as an element or a consequence of that Being and it's actions and values. This helps me to fathom how we can attempt to understand the Drug War and what we're doing by enacting these cultural values (or perhaps simply allowing them to be enacted upon us, either way...). For one thing, we can then assume that this is not something frivolous. If the experience of Altered States were something frivolous, it would not have the sort of historical ties with Humanity and the type of broad social currency which it has and does, all across the World and throughout Time. So whether it's something good, bad, or neutral, it is not merely an inconsequential thing...we should be examining it seriously, no matter what our personal opinions. This war is not a serious examination, it is, as I said, a form of suppression. With the Being analogy of culture then this Drug War could actually be seen as a type of repression of Shadow Material. Instead of confronting Altered States we combat them, so we don't have to acknowledge them and start looking at the questions and complications that these states suggest. Therefore, like Shadow Material, the problem of Altered States will not disappear with repression, rather it will gain weight and ferocity in the depths of the it's dark exile, continually growing and becoming expressed with more violence and fear until it is finally acknowledged, and dealt with rationally and honestly. So, yes, it can get worse. It most likely will get worse...but the possibility is there that someday maybe enough people will open themselves up to searching for what is honest and truly felt rather than simply accepting what is, upon inspection, nothing but a maniacal suppression of an inevitable conflict.

Pinchbeck has about the same stratospheric odiousness level as GWB as far as I'm concerned, and I'm hoping to see some other name get out there as the go-to for mainstream reporters on the subject of psychedelics and especially ayahuasca.   Unfortunately, no one's as tied in to the mechanics of marketing oneself quite like he is.    Grrrr.

Ayahuasca does have a golden reputation in the press, but that is easy to ruin.  What has kept that reputation solid for the most part is how it's used now - in a circle, with at least a modicum of introspection, and usually someone with a decent amount of experience steering the boat.  I doubt there's anything intrinsic in the drug that's keeping the reputation so good (although I'm open to convincing on this).   

The question isn't "Will ayahuasca become mainstream", it's more "Can we keep cultures, individuals, and economics from getting trashed as it becomes more hip?" 0 24.62.239.164 1

I've thought about this a bit and have come to a couple of conclusions. First of all, the inclusion of harmine and harmaline in the brew makes the user sleepy and prone to lying down and having waking dreams instead of dancing all night and/or running naked out into traffic; it's more "gentle" and predictable which makes it more savory to academics and advocates. Secondly, the fact that it tastes like pig's bile and makes you puke like a fire-hose makes it fairly immune to recreational abuse, thus strengthening its "good medicine" mystique. Thirdly, because it has been adopted into traditional and syncretic religious ceremonies and the Supreme Court can't touch it, advocates love to fawn all over it as the most "spiritual" psychedelic, and we all know that in drug code "spiritual" = "good". And finally, no one has dosed on ayahuasca and jumped out of a window and/or accidentally murdered someone yet (though you all know it is probably coming one of these days). Until that day the brew gets a free ride from the press. 0 66.235.37.130 1

1119 4214 0 Silas. 2008-02-09 14:53:09 I've been curious about this whole issue why people think the number of drugs he was on was so extreme. They didn't have to be a lot, and he didn't have to get them from the same doctor. I have occasional kidney stones, and the ER docs really push the oxy and hydro for that, so I always have a few half empty bottles lying around, put an anxiety disorder on top of that bam you've got the benzos, all legitimately prescribed by responsible doctors. Quit blaming the doctors and the pharm companies. Comon people, drugs don't take themselves. Geez. 0 206.81.65.155 1
1120 4178 117 magicbean 2008-02-09 15:01:14 I buy your first reason wholesale.   Folks ain't going far.   Or fast.

Second reason, meh...many recreational drugs have ghastly unpleasant side effects or dosing methods.   It's a subjective thing and trainable, what we'll put up with, no?  Puke or stick a needle in your arm, which is more unpleasant?

Third reason, I'll buy that too, with comment.   I see the free press pass for Ayahuasca as a good thing, because that free ride might hook other stuff along with it.  If A is acceptable, then its equivalent B, previously assumed to be completely unacceptable, might make progress back towards OK.   The longer it stays a press virgin, the better all around.   

The spiritual crowd also tends to be older, quieter, and less likely to post abominable videos of themselves on youtube.   They make idiots of themselves in private ways! 0 24.62.239.164 1

2234 4681 74 avicenna 2008-05-14 22:30:49 Zupakomputer: Funny, you should ask. Slate has a column called "The Green Lantern" which takes (generally totally inane) questions like "Is concentrated orange juice better for the environment than fresh squeezed?" and gives them genuinely interesting answers that all boil down to "Well, it depends..." Now, I'm not a fan of trying to reduce highly multidimensional ideas like "good for the environment" into a one dimensional scale with "good" on one end and "bad" on the other, so it's kind of a guilty pleasure read for me, but I like that it's honest enough to always say "Well, it depends..." Anyway, just especially for our little discussion, this week it takes on lawn maintenance. Here it is:

http://www.slate.com/id/2191200/

Now, it mostly compares regular lawn maintainence to artificial turf, but the basic ideas are there. Another thing to note is that in making these comparisons, it is really only meaningful to compare something to an alternative which is a reasonable substitute for the activity/product in question. Thus, the cocaine analysis compares it to coffee, which I gave them a little grief over whether it is comparable.

tomk, loco: Yes, there are exceptions, and my friend whom I quoted actually mentioned a few: organic beer and wine, sunlight grown organic pot, and a couple more. Shrooms were probably on the list. I doubt peyote was. But the real point is that unless you are growing your own, your drugs probably do have a non-neglible ecological footprint.

Bricoleur: I appreciate your concern for my psychological well being. Allow me to return the favor: Although I generally avoid this sort of diagnosis over the internet, I wonder whether you are projecting *your* emotional baggage about guilt and sin onto my quoting and referencing someone else's use of a fairly common English word.  I mean I even used what might be considered scare quotes, except that I really was quoting someone else, and I abhor scare quotes. 0 67.170.97.126 1
2235 4692 34 jamesk 2008-05-14 22:34:38 It just goes to show that two of the most popular "worst case scenarios" of the drug scene can still be in and out of the joint, make records, and not give a fuck.

2236 4698 0 Adam L. 2008-05-14 23:02:00 It turns out they meant something else by "lines of drugs off his bureau." They really meant lined-up prescription drugs, on-label. 0 24.138.29.176 1

It's weird if you do, cause it's like your life becomes anchored around taking meds, and then you have to eat at the exact same times every day too and plan your food eating like an hour before or after meds. 

But yeah, geez try eating proper food and not living or working in some un-natural shitty environment if you can, then you're way less likely to ever need any meds.
Take some sun, breathe fresh real air, don't drink tap water. Eat some fresh food everyday that hasn't been grown with chemical fertilisers.
I know that if I did what most people do in terms of food, I'd be either dead already or very chronically ill. No doubt. 0 213.78.96.173 1
2238 4701 0 zupakomputer. 2008-05-16 09:02:58 In the future, there'll be documentaries on the rabid psychosis of these here times, that prompted anyone to have such a problem with growing / using pot that they'd actually go as far as raiding places and speaking out against growing / using it.

Seriously, wtf is their problem? How can it possibly be doing them any harm if ALL that's being done is growing / using pot. How the fuck do they justify their even making it their business. 

Think Real Hard About This, if it ain't dawned upon you yet:

Why would anyone REASONABLY be bothered about what is going on INSIDE ANOTHER PERSONS MIND.

Can you see what they are yet? Have I been blatant enough here? No?, fine then:

THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DRUGS BECAUSE THEY ARE USING OTHER PEOPLES MINDS FOR SOME KIND OF SELFISH, EXCEPTIONALLY ABUSIVE, AND UNSPOKEN (NOT OPENLY ADMITTED TO) PURPOSE.

I won't go into the details of that purpose; the point is that it shouldn't be able to happen. 0 213.78.96.173 1

2240 4686 0 GVSU. 2008-05-16 11:10:12 Back in college I took part in the tussin experience. We would drink a bottle of robotussin, have a stomach ache for about 30 minutes and then go crazy for a few hours. One day I accidentally drank two bottles. I say accidentally because it started out as a sip out of the second bottle then another then a gulp until it was gone. After finishing that second bottle I realized I might have made a mistake. Then I proceeded to try and fit under the fridge. In all honesty it looked like the fridge was 3 feet off the ground. After telling everone "I COULD fit under the fridge I just don't have the energy right now" I flopped up the stairs. I went into my ex-girlfriends room and start yelling " Can someone please help that cat at the end of the bed. THere was no cat I was told the next day. Then the freaky stuff started. I don't remember much, but I was told I was shaking and talking giberish but looked like I was having the time of my life, so that is good. Of what I do remember there are many snapshots of the night. THe ceiling being pressed against my nose while laying in a bed 2 feet off the ground, and random flashes of color and motion. All in all I THINK I had fun. I met alot of new people as i found out the next couple of weeks. " Hey you where the guy trying to fit under the fridge" or " hey did you ever catch that cat" . 

Unfortunatlly you can not do this anymore. The Robotussen company has stopped making the extra strength cough formula, well they still make it but different ingredients. The DXM was removed from it. I believe you can still buy DXM legally off the internet but not sure on that. From what I understand the DXM pills are different from tru RoboTripping because you don't have those extra ingredients and sugar. Merry trips to all and to all a good trip. 0 208.51.153.226 1

879 30 trip456f3dac3639c www.physorg.com Marijuana may affect neuron firing The new-found effect of THC at hippocampal sites may point to underlying cause of marijuana's memory impairment U.S. scientists have discovered the active ingredient in marijuana interferes with synchronized activity between neurons in the hippocampus of rats.

The authors suggest action of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, might explain why marijuana impairs memory.

Gyorgy Buzsaki and colleagues at Rutgers University recorded the activity of multiple neurons in the hippocampus of rats. Normally neurons in that region form groups that fire action potentials, or nerve impulses, together at about 4-10 times per second. But when the authors injected THC, or a related synthetic drug, into the hippocampus, that synchrony was disrupted.

The researchers said the drugs did not change the total number of action potentials produced, just their tendency to occur at the same time. Animals with less synchronized neural activity under the drug performed less well in a standard test of memory, suggesting synchronized neural firing is important for normal hippocampal function.

The study appears in the December issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience. http://www.physorg.com/news84048508.html News Drugs 2 22 0 0 marijuana brain memory 0 1 tripzine 2006-11-30 14:23:08 30 0 www.tripzine.com 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 0 0.00 0.00 0 41 2010-05-05 15:28:34
878 30 trip456f3d22e578a media.www.dukechronicle.com Duke drug culture examined Interesting article taking an honest look at undergrad drug culture at Duke University Before Mike came to Duke, he was a typical high-achieving student.

Like many of his high school classmates, he drank on occasion but had tried little else.

By his sophomore year at Duke, Mike had experimented with cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, Viagra and Cialis. And he was smoking marijuana nearly every day.

"We tried to make each night as fun as possible," said Mike, reflecting on the behavior of his friends from freshman and sophomore year.

Now a junior, Mike said that, in retrospect, the lifestyle took a toll on their academics. http://media.www.dukechronicle.com/media/storage/paper884/news/2006/11/30/News/Highs.Lows.Mark.Duke.Drug.Culture-2515082.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dukechronicle.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com News Drugs 2 22 0 0 Duke drugs marijuana 0 1 tripzine 2006-11-30 14:20:50 30 0 www.tripzine.com 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 0 0.00 0.00 0 43 2010-01-20 11:58:36
877 30 trip456dc98e637cb www.ksl.com Utah lawmaker moves to ban salvia TV news scare report on Salvia divinorum prompts lawmaker to act An immediate response to last night's Eyewitness News Investigation into the herb called Salvia. Just hours after we warned you about the legal but dangerous substance, a Utah lawmaker took some action.

Utah Lawmaker Paul Ray watched our story on Salvia divinorum. He didn't like what he saw.

"I am rocking the world right now. I just feel like I am rocking the world."

Only KSL brought you the video of kids tripping out on the legal herb, Salvia -- a substance narcotics officers compare to LSD.

"Like I've stepped outside my body."

We went undercover to show you how easy it is to buy the hallucinogen at Salt Lake Valley smoke shops. Our story revealed that while Utah teens know all about smoking Salvia to get high, parents are in the dark.

"Never knew anything about this. Never heard of this."

Rep. Paul Ray, (R) Clearfield: "It was upsetting to see we have a drug of that strength that's legal."

Moments after our story ended, Utah Representative Paul Ray began writing a bill to ban Salvia. We were there on Capitol Hill to see the paperwork filed.

Rep. Paul Ray, (R) Clearfield: "We're basically going to make it illegal to possess or sell. Period."

Late today we learned one local police department is also reacting to our story. They've decided now is the right time to educate officers about the herb, emailing out information and photos of Salvia. http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=682728 News Drugs 2 22 0 0 salvia hallucinogen herb 0 1 tripzine 2006-11-29 11:55:26 30 0 www.tripzine.com 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 0 0.00 0.00 0 65 2010-04-06 14:32:35

75 30 traffic 01.30.01 Traffic Steven Soderbergh 's latest film is heavy on style and chock full of anti drug-war propaganda, but does it deliver the dope? Christopher Dale <font color=ff0000><b>YOU MAY HAVE HEARD</b></font> about this movie 'Traffic', a gritty real-life portrayal of life on the front lines of the drug war, directed artfully by Steven Soderbergh and crammed end to end with major Hollywood stars. Sure you've heard about it, maybe you've even seen it by now. It's up for a few awards. It's full of anti drug-war propaganda. It's being labeled as a 'classic' and Soderbergh is now a 'genius'. But is the movie really all that good?

I went into Traffic with high expectations and must say that it was quite good for a movie churned out of the Hollywood system. Soderbergh's film-school tricks for adding hues or extra exposure to scenes depending on their mood and location embedded a layer of depth and tension into the narrative and gave the whole film a by-the-hip indie feel you'd expect from a younger director. And the way the varying levels of storytelling intersected silently with each other in random locations throughout the film gives the viewer a heightened sense of thoughtfulness from the director that you wouldn't expect from a typical cut-and-paste action thriller.

Yes, it is a good movie. Even the actors are good in it, and the two prep-school baseheads played by Erika Christensen and Topher Grace (That '70s Show) are especially interesting. But where Traffic ultimatly piles up is in the screenplay itself. The story is good and the message is clear ("The Drug War is futile at best, deadly at worst"), but the way in which the story plays out left me feeling a bit cheated, once again lied to by the slick merchandising machine that is Hollywood.

If you have not seen the movie and hate spoilers you can stop reading here and skip ahead to the last paragraph. I am about to divulge a few problems I had with the end of the film. First off, the realism of the movie flew completely out the window as conservative Drug-Czar to be Robert Wakefield (played effortlessly by Michael Douglas) caves in on his acceptance speech and has a tender change of heart about his hard-line Drug War beliefs in front of the American public. He then races to support his crack-addicted daughter through treatment and recovery and we are led to believe that through his courage and a little lip-service at narc-anon that everything will be alright. Up until this point the movie was fairly unflinching in its attempt at realism, even convincing, but the over-the-top Oliver Stone-ing of message coupled with the 'coming-up-roses' ending made me feel sold. For all the plot complexity, in the end the message was as crisp and heavy-handed as an after-school special.

Despite all that, I wouldn't recommend that you just say 'No' to Traffic. Even though it's only about blow I would say it's worth seeing, but do keep a critical eye on the message vs. what actually happens in the movie. The contradictions in this film are as earnest and illogical as America's own love/hate relationship with drugs, and maybe that's the movie's whole point. Either way, it is still a good movie by Hollywood standards.

76 30 downey 01.30.01 Poster Boy Choosing who or what goes on the cover of a magazine is one of the most important decisions a publisher can make. Take a look at some of the issues we deal with. James Kent <font color=ff0000><b>SO I WAS THINKING</b></font> about relaunching this magazine I publish, TRP: The Resonance Project, but there was a problem with it. The name was too long. People kept mispronouncing 'resonance', or pronouncing it right but confusing us with another fine Seattle periodical called 'Resonance' that covers the dance music scene. It was a pain. The name was meant to convey a complex metaphysical idea within a handy three letter acronym, but some people just weren't getting it. Some understood, a few even cheered the concept of a 'Resonance Project', but everyone else just called it TRP, or Trip.

Yes, <i>trip</i> is a much shorter meme with less baggage and more action. It is nowhere near as academic or arcane as TRP, but it is freer and, dare we say, a bit hipper. It will infiltrate the mind faster, stick longer, and go farther. It is borne into motion and built to travel. That is what it is, a <i>trip</i>, a journey through space and time where every tiny detail is as important as the big picture. 

Once we had decided on the name change I began ruminating about what to put on the cover of the first issue. Choosing who or what goes on the cover of a magazine is one of the most important decisions a publisher can make. A cover not only defines who and what you are, but it also dictates where your magazine will be placed on the racks even moreso than actual content. For example, a magazine with Brad Pitt or Madonna on the cover will get front-row placement next to 'Vogue' or 'GQ' even if the magazine is about organic gardening. It is what publishers with fringe markets do to branch out to the mainstream and attract new readers. It is called marketing. 

Which brings us to poor Robert Downey Jr. (or RDJ as we like to call him around here). RDJ is in an interesting position right now because he represents the grand paradox of American drug culture. Here is one of our generation's best and brightest, a celebrated actor of exceeding wit and charm, and a purebred product of the Hollywood drug culture. He would be indistinguishable from any one of a dozen of his peers except for one thing: he got himself in trouble. Now he is more famous than all of them, just won a Golden Globe for 'Ally McBeal', and could go back to jail for doing even more drugs! What could be more interesting than <i>that</i>? Let's put him on the cover! Our distributors will love us!

Cashing in on the tragedy of celebrity is nothing new for magazines -- in fact it may be the reason magazines were invented -- but we've never really done it before. Having a celebrity on the cover would definitely mean better placement on the stands, higher sales, more money, and more unsuspecting members of the mainstream being accidently exposed to our supremely radical vision, so the decision seemed obvious. We will sell out. We will put RDJ on the cover. We will rationalize it all on payday.

But then we thought about it for a few days and started to feel icky. The questions started to gnaw at us. Is RDJ really the kind of role model we want for our magazine? Will putting him on the cover glorify his self-destructive behavior? Will our subscribers be offended by this brazen move towards the mainstream? And, most of all, will RDJ even return our phone calls? These are the things we think about, the spiritual politics of playing in the big media circus. Do we step into the mainstream like we're in charge or keep our heads down and walk safely and quietly through the subculture. 

In the end we decided the RDJ cover was more of a spoof then a real cover. We chose instead a spectacular image from an underground artist named Morpheus. It probably won't warrant placement next to 'Details' or 'Spin', but it will find a nice spot in the alternative section and probably deserves more exposure than RDJ anyway. And though I hate to use the term "keepin' it real" when I'm not all pimped-out in my black velvet Nike track suit, that is essentially what we are doing here. We changed the name but we heven't changed the game. That RDJ shit, we was just frontin' on that, for real.

79 30 sirius from TRP 5 An Interview with RU Sirius A look inside the mind of Mondo's errant editor and the man who might have been president Malvolio Rutteledge <b>MR: In "Revolution #5" on Disinfo.com, you wrote, "The truth can now be told... the United States is a police state..." How far ranging do you think the drug war has become in orchestrating the bulk of current U.S. troubles? Do you feel that the suppression of cannabis and other entheogens is really the major political lynchpin that libertarians such as Dick Cowan would have us believe? We're talking vested interests here...</b>

RU: I consider the drug war to be a bigger disaster for America than the war in Viet Nam. In terms of the destruction of our civil liberties, the evolution of a prison/industrial complex, some five and a half million people in prisons... so that now there's a vested economic interest in incarcerating people, the majority of them for drugs... the McCarthyism of ubiquitous drug testing, the seizure of property without trial or conviction, just on and on. The question I have is where are our Berrigan brothers? Where's our Doctor Spock? Where are the religious persons of conscience spilling blood on files in the DEA offices? They've got something like 30% of young black males now in the criminal punishment system, the US is being denounced by Amnesty International because the prisons themselves are torture chambers. Where's the peace movement? 

<b>Why are prisons and entertainment the only growing U.S. industry?</b>

Well, we're the first post-industrial state. Leisure, play, amusement, those are the would-be industries of the future. Prison is a kind of enforced leisure I guess, in a weird sort of way.

<b>You wrote that most Americans find the current totalitarian state passable as long as they are not directly involved with it. Just how totalitarian IS the United States? </b>

Well, you don't see any great uprising do you? I mean, they're searching our urine! On a certain highway outside of Austin, Texas, on random days, they just pull everybody over and search their cars for drugs. You're supposed to be able to refuse to have your car searched without reasonable cause, but the Texas judiciary in its wisdom has figured out that refusing IS reasonable cause. There's an institutionalized Catch 22 right there in Texas but don't ask don't tell anyone.

<b>Professor David Marc wrote in "The Bonfire of the Humanities" that the current drug prohibition is aimed at the lower class and the middle class because the government "doesn't want people too stoned to go to work." Do you agree? </b>

I think it's one element of a confluence of reasons. The illegality of drugs is a huge industry. I'm sure when Nixon escalated it into a war, it was at least partly about budgets... who gets to have a project and get a bunch of money. The DEA... the various arms of law enforcement and the justice system involved in that particular area. And then there was just the cultural hostility towards the underclass, towards blacks and, particularly in its origins in 1968, against hippies and the "new left." Finally, there's the black budget profits that are gained by keeping the pleasure drug industry in the shadows.

<b>I often look at photos of the drug czar and wonder what is in that guy's head. What is in that guy's head? He obviously believes in state obscurantism... </b>

He doesn't look much like a Czar, does he? What's the story with General Barry McCaffrey? He seems smart and yet he says such dumb things. Does he know any better? We know Bill and Al know better. It was probably politically expedient for them to choose somebody who was totally clueless when it came to drugs.

<b>What role do you see sociobiology playing in future organization of society? Edward O. Wilson's work at one point was regarded (and possibly still is) as quite heretical in that it posited an almost completely deterministic conception of the human species. It's interesting how this could tie in with Huxley's satire on society, Brave New World.</b>

I've just been re-reading Edward O. Wilson's On Human Nature and it strikes me as much more poetic, humane and sympathetic the second time through. I find it amusing that some humanists are offended by the notion that there's any connection whatsoever between human societal organization and behavior and animal societal organization and behavior. Talk about human chauvinism. It's weird when you talk to people whose opinions on science and the nature of things is dictated by political comfort, so that exploring the biological roots of behavior becomes verboten. That's weird. Don't even look over here. Don't think about this. Umm... Animal Farm, yes.

<b>How do you feel about voting? </b>

Nauseous. Actually, I want people to vote for me. I've started the new political party, The Revolution, and I'm our candidate for President! Just say R.U. Sirius, the only response to the other candidates. In all seriousness, I think if we non-authoritarians voted, we could form a power block that would provide a countervailing influence to the right wing moralists and also help to break the Republicrat two-party hold on the political process.

<b>Can you define the political platform of your Revolution party? </b>

I would define it as 21st Century Humanist Libertarianism, or damned near something like that. 

<b>If you were elected president today, what would your first domestic and foreign policy decisions be? </b>

My first domestic policy decision after ordering up pizza would be to pardon all federal prisoners in for non-violent drug possession charges and all prisoners listed with Amnesty International. My second move would be to stop providing all the arms to pretty much everybody globally... 

<b>In your opinion are there any grey areas at all between anarchy and authoritarinism, and if there are how can we ever hope to acheive a happy medium? </b>

Absolutely. I'm not an anarchist in any absolutist sense. I think the Jeffersonian tradition as reflected in the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights is plenty anti-authoritarian. We've never lived up to those principles. 

<b>What do you think is the most dangerous thing about the Internet? </b>

Ubiquitous decentralized media more or less destroys social consensus, destroys consensus reality, by dispersing attention. This is on the one hand desirable, but it's also problematic. You can't bring people together too easily, for instance, to make social change. 

<b>Do you think WebTV will catch on? It has been claimed that it could revolutionize the world. For example, in China, where the state controls most media, if all you need is a TV and a keyboard you could access the Internet. Still, one does not hear much about WebTV. Predictions?</b>

Eventually, there will be a medium that will allow individuals to upload video, both tape and live, so that individuals will be able to broadcast materials at the same level of quality that we're accustomed to. Will it revolutionize the world? I think in some sense, the utter decentralization of public media and public discourse devolutionizes the world, but in an interesting way. We can no longer locate a consensus reality to subvert. The only thing that would revolutionize the world would be production technologies that overwhelm scarcity. The first step toward that is anything that will end our reliance on oil. I'd say we have a few years &#151; less than a decade &#151; to make a complete transition from oil usage &#151; if we're lucky. Probably, it's already too late.

<b>After spending the early 90s at Mondo &#151; ground-zero of the whole cyber-psychedelic rave-culture explosion &#151; what do you think of the shape of that particular scene today? What do you think the next big wave of countercultural revolution will look like? </b>

The commercial rave scene has spread psychedelic experimentation and thinking among youths like nothing since the hippie culture in the sixties, but I'm not personally interested. Smaller private rave gatherings are still pretty nice. It's almost become the assumption that an opening for a new hip magazine, or even a sugar saturated beverage trying to appear hip, will have a rave party for their opening. It's ubiquitous. I don't think we can talk in terms of counterculture anymore because the consensus reality that counter would be counter to is so confused and dispersed. I think we'll see more and more subculture. But I also think that people who like to mind their own business will get political for obvious reasons of self-protection... 

<b>What was your overall experience as editor for Mondo? Seemed like a cool position to be in.</b>

Mondo was the biggest fun of my life. When it was in its groove for a couple of years, it was a pleasure to be part of it. There weren't really any office rules, and yet we made it work. I could smoke DMT in the living room on a work day, if the moment seemed right. I haven't been able to find another job like that!

<b>What do you think of Wired magazine? It seems like a giant hoax to me. Like George. A yes-man club of a few yuppie technophiles. What are your favorite magazines? Do you like Hustler?</b>

Wired was interesting early on, when it explored some topics in depth. But Wired was a safe corporate clone of Mondo 2000, and the current Wired is an even safer corporate clone of itself. The early Wired was, at least, an authentic project of genuine technophiles. The current Wired is being done by professional journalists, people with no connection to technoculture &#151; people of no vision who laughed at the notion of cyberculture before it became mainstream. I like Pop Smear, a very hip and funny sort of tabloidesque semi-pornographic zine out of New York City. And I like Mean, which is a very well-written sort of subculture/pop zine. Hustler doesn't really have much in terms of interesting content, although I like pornography in general. I prefer Club International as far as straightforward semi-gynecological photos of distortedly silicone-based hyper-sexualized young women are concerned. I liked 21.c, a technoculture zine out of Australia that straddled the line between academic and pop, but now that's gone. 

<b>What authors are you currently reading? Why?</b>

I'm finally reading Neal Stephenson's latest book. I read a chapter from it that was published in Time and thought it was great. I've been recently devouring whatever Bruce Sterling novels I hadn't already read. I think his most recent work, Distraction, is amazing. And I'm reading this book called BOGGS: A Comedy of Values, by Lawrence Weschler. It's about this artist who paints money and trades the paintings at the value he puts on the money for goods and services. In other words, if he paints a $50 bill he convinces someone to take it in trade for $50 worth of whatever...

<b>Do you like Ketamine? </b>

I like Ketamine mostly because it doesn't last very long. If someone would come up with an LSD or a psilocybin where you could peak in a few minutes and be completely done in an hour-and-a-half, that would be just as good. But Ketamine, I think, gets you to your core address. It gives you the perspective of distance, but with a weird technological edge.

<b>In "The Scientist", Lilly had a vision on Ketamine where he went into the future and saw all the cars running on water vapor. I saw a week ago in the news that Chrystler-Daimler-Benz revealed a car that does just that and will be available for purchase in 2004... </b>

I definitely believe that scientific and technological solutions present themselves in psychedelic experiences. 

<b>What kind of new technology have you been using or like?</b>

I'm not that much of a user of technology. Like William Gibson, I follow technology and its cultural significance. I leave the hacking to others. I like the whole MP3 thing though. I really want there to be a global jukebox attached to some kind of machine. I put in my credit card or my ATM card and for say $1 I can hear any album that was ever recorded. Once I've picked that album say 15 times, I own it and can listen to it any time I want. 

<b>A friend of mine bitterly claims that the TV he watched as a child created archetypes in his mind that will never go away. Do you think that's true? I mean, there is the use-it-or-lose-it law of mental processing, right?</b>

Ward, I think it's time to have a few words with the Beaver. He sounds like he's on drugs or something.

<b>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? </b>

Sure I'll have custard... Interviews Drugs 3 22 53 0 psychedelic 1 2 Drugs tripzine 2001-04-23 00:00:00 2005-12-21 21:34:56 tripzine 1 www.tripzine.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 5 0000-00-00 00:00:00 0 http://chrysler.websitewelcome.com/~tripzine/images/sirius.jpg 0.00 0.00 0 81 2010-05-07 13:09:33
80 30 vine from TRP 1 Vine of the Souls A Closer Look at Amozonia's Visionary Medicine Charlie Kidder <font color=ff0000><b>DEEP IN THE HEART</b></font> of the Amazonian rainforest grows a sacred vine known for its magical powers. This vine is known by many names, but the most well known of them all may be ayahuasca (aye-yah-wah-skah). In the Quechua language, aya means spirit or ancestor, and huasca means vine or rope. It is reputed that those who consume this vine of the souls are bestowed with the ability to commune with spirits, diagnose illness, treat disease, and even predict the future. While the existence of this vine is certainly no big secret, it is only recently that western science has decided to study the magical properties of this sacred medicine. 

Archaeological evidence may date ayahuasca use in Ecuador back five millennia. However, western knowledge of ayahuasca dates back only as far as 1851 when a group of Tukanoan Indians invited British botanist and explorer Richard Spruce to participate in a ceremony which included a visionary drink they called caapi. Spruce only drank a small amount of the "nauseous beverage," but he couldn't help noticing the profound effect it had on his new friends. The Tukanoans showed Spruce the plant from which the caapi was made, and he was able to collect good specimens of the plant in full flower. Spruce named the plant Banisteria caapi, and further research led him to conclude that caapi, yage, and ayahuasca were all Indian names for the same potion made using this one vine. 

Since these early findings, indigenous use of various ayahuasca potions has been reported throughout the Amazon as far east as the R'o Negro in Brazil and as far west as the Pacific coastal areas of Colombia and Ecuador. It is also found as far north as the Panama coast, and southward into areas of Amazonian Perœ and Bolivia. At least 72 indigenous groups have been found to use similar preparations known by a total of over forty different names. 

<b>Preparation</b>

Ayahuasca potions are normally prepared by soaking or steeping lianas of Banisteriopsis caapi or related species for various lengths of time. The specific method varies from group to group, but the simplest method is a cold water infusion where pieces of the stem are first pounded and allowed to stand in cold water, after which the plant material is strained off and the remaining potion drunk. Some groups will immerse the pounded stems in hot water, cooking the plant material anywhere from an hour to all day long. The longest of these preparation methods involves repeated boiling and filtering of the plant matter and extract until only a thick concentrate remains. This process normally comprises a whole day's work, taking up to fifteen hours to prepare a single batch. 

Banisteriopsis caapi is often the only plant used to make ayahuasca. However, it is not an uncommon practice to add one or more admixture plants to the brew during its preparation. Admixture plants help to flavor the experience of each specific batch of ayahuasca, and often contain stimulants or visionary compounds, like caffeine, nicotine, or DMT. In ayahuasca potions made using DMT-containing additives, it is most likely that DMT is the key visionary ingredient, responsible for most if not all of the potion's powerful entheogenic effects. 

<b>Pharmacology of Ayahuasca </b>

DMT was first synthesized in 1931, fifteen years before it was discovered to be a naturally occuring compound. DMT is found in many psychoactive Amazonian snuffs prepared from the resin of numerous species of Virola trees, and was first naturally extracted from a shamanic snuff made from the crushed seeds and pods of Anadenanthera peregrina in 1955. In 1956, Stephen I. Szara and colleagues became the first to experience the effects of the hydrochloride salt of N,N-Dimethyltryptamine via intramuscular injection at doses ranging from 0.7 to 1.1 mg per kg body weight. He found the drug to produce what he described as a "psychotic effect partially similar to that caused by mescaline or LSD-25." Szara found that after injecting 50 to 60 mg of DMT, entheogenic effects commenced within two to three minutes, lasting about 45 minutes to an hour. He described the effects thus: "Eidetic phenomena, optical illusions, pseudo-hallucinations and later real hallucinations, appeared. The hallucinations consisted of moving, brilliantly colored oriental motifs, and later I saw wonderful scenes altering very rapidly. The faces of the people seemed to be masks. My emotional state was elevated sometimes up to euphoria..." 

By 1977, it was established that smoking DMT free base produces a more potent and rapid effect than does injection. Thirty mg of DMT smoked was found to produce almost instant peak effects, lasting a total of only five to ten minutes. However, DMT has been tested in doses of up to an entire gram ingested orally without producing any effects whatsoever. So the question remained: Since DMT appears to be completely inactive orally, how can the average 29 mg found in an orally ingested dose of ayahuasca produce a visionary effect? 

The answer to this question lies in the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). This enzyme normally functions in our digestive systems to break down any monoamines present within the foods we eat so that they do not upset the balances of monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism going on in our brains. DMT, being a monoamine, is completely oxidized and decomposed by MAO in the gut when it is ingested orally. However, the §-carboline alkaloids from the Banisteriopsis liana are know to inhibit MAO to the point where the accompanying DMT from the admixture plant can survive in the digestive tract and make its way to the brain. 

The structure of DMT (as well as those of other entheogenic compounds) is remarkably close to that of the important modulatory neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT). Such neurotransmitter shuffling is thought to bring about the disinhibition of normally controlled and regulated processes within the brain. The binding of serotonin-like molecules to the 5-HT receptors affects serotonergic neurons which can stimulate a wide range of things - from repressed emotions and memories to the brain's image-processing system. This unique combination of neural stimuli results in a wondrous explosion of transcendent emotion and internal kaleidoscopic imagery. 

<b>Shamanic Use of Ayahuasca </b>

The mestizo shamans of the Peruvian Amazon generally refer to themselves as vegetalistas. These plant-doctors help the people of rural areas and the urban poor who often have no other available help in critical situations requiring medical attention. Most vegetalistas tend to specialize, using just one or few plant teachers in their practices. Thus there are tabaqueros who use tobacco; toeros who use various Brugmansia species; catahueros who use the resin of catahua (Hura crepitans); paleros who use the bark of various large trees; perfumeros who use the scents of various fragrant plants; and ayahuasqueros who use ayahuasca. 

The shamanic use of ayahuasca is usually within the context of healing. The shaman or ayahuasquero takes ayahuasca to better diagnose the nature of the patient's illness. Vegetalistas claim they receive their healing skills from certain plant teachers, who are believed to have a madre or spirit-mother. The role of the shaman is to mediate the transmission of medicinal knowledge from the plant teacher to the human world for use in curing. 

The plant teachers are believed to teach the neophyte shaman a number of power songs or supernatural melodies called icaros, either during an ayahuasca session or in dreams following the ingestion of other plant teachers. The plant teachers give the magical songs to the vegetalista so that he or she may sing or whistle them during healing sessions. Some shamans place so much emphasis on the healing power of the icaros that once he or she has learned a good number of them, the ayahuasca is no longer necessary for healing. 

Artist and Peruvian vegetalista Pablo Amaringo has painted a series of his past ayahuasca visions, depicting them in great detail. In order to do this, Amaringo will attempt to recall one of his visions, sometimes by singing the icaro he sang at the time of the vision. This brings back the image so vividly that Amaringo is able to project it onto a canvas and then simply trace it adding colors later. Images from ayahuasca visions are a predominate feature of Amazonian art. It has been suggested that this visual art along with the melodies of the icaros combine with the synaesthetic effects of the potion to produce an "aesthetic frame of mind" central to the healing process. The design the shaman paints onto his or her body is believed to represent a healthy energy pattern, and is often revealed by the ayahuasca. 

When a person becomes sick, their energy pattern becomes distorted. Under the influence of ayahuasca, the shaman can see the distortion in the patient's energy pattern and attempt to restore a healthy pattern using suction, massage, medicinal plants, hydrotherapy, and restoration of the patient's soul. The similarities between these shamanic methods and techniques used in traditional Chinese chi-gong, or "energy directed" medicine, should be noted. Interestingly, a shaman usually chooses medicinal plants based on visible characteristics, like shape or color. For example, a plant which produces flowers shaped like an ear may be used to treat ear diseases. Part of the novice shaman's training involves scrutinizing nature to learn about the properties or "hidden virtues" within the surrounding plants and animals. 

<b>Modern Interest in Ayahuasca </b>

From the first written mention of ayahuasca by a Jesuit priest near the end of the 17th century to current research dealing with ayahuasca, our knowledge of this ancient Amazonian ethnomedicine has grown considerably. In just the last few decades, a fair number of publications have been written on the topic; anthropologists have begun studying how ayahuasca is used to heal; and research groups have started studying the potion's long-term physiological and psychological effects. Another interesting modern phenomenon is the growing number of Christian churches throughout South America who have opted for ayahuasca as their sacrament during communion instead of the usual symbolic bread and wine sacraments. These churches claim that the potion helps to promote intense concentration and direct contact with the spiritual plane. 

The first of these ayahuasca churches were initially formed in the 1920s in Brazil, and today two groups, the Uni‹o de Vegetal (UDV or 'Herbal Union') and the Santo Daime [see related article], continue to flourish. These neo-Christian churches now mainly exist in urban areas, and represent the modern movement of ritual ayahuasca use from the primal rainforest into the big city. 

In these churches mass is held once a week. The church members cultivate the plants needed to make the potion, and oversee its preparation and storage. On special occasions, ayahuasca is dispensed in small cups at communion. The dose is only a couple of ounces, but the ayahuasca they produce has been reported to be very strong. As the celebration usually lasts all night long, it is not unusual for members of the church to take several doses during the course of the evening. 

In 1985, the Brazilian government added the ayahuasca liana to its list of controlled substances. The UDV soon petitioned the ban and the Brazilian government appointed a commission to investigate the issue. The commission found no evidence of social disruption associated with the sacramental use of ayahuasca (which the commission members tried themselves) and ayahuasca was removed from the Brazilian controlled substances list in August of 1987. More problems arose in 1988 when an anonymous source alleged that the churches consisted of fanatics, drug addicts, and ex-guerrillas given to smoking Cannabis and taking LSD during their rites. Yet another study of the issue was ordered by the government, this time to investigate the physiological aspects of ayahuasca's pharmacology. The conclusions of this study prompted the Brazilian government in June of 1992 to exempt Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis - as well as the ayahuasca potion - from its illicit substances list. This legal decision has opened the doors to the further expansion of these churches, which have since held ceremonies in several cities all over the world. An international scientific research team, the Hoasca Project, has recently begun studying the long term effects, both psychological and physiological, of chronic ayahuasca use by these church members. 

<b>Ayahuasca and the Future </b>

It is hard to say what the future may hold for ayahuasca. It could prove to be a useful tool in helping science better understand the biochemistry of consciousness and the genetics of pathological brain function. Pharmaceutical MAO-inhibitors are widely used in western medicine as anti-depressants, and further research into the psychotherapeutic benefits gained from the tryptamines remains to be done. 

As far as religion is concerned, the potential for expansion of ayahuasca-using churches seems unlimited. Incorporation of a powerful psychoactive sacrament into religious ceremonies could have far-reaching effects on modern spiritual practices and beliefs. However, it remains to be seen whether entheogen users here in the U.S. would be attracted to the idea of psychedelic Christianity. 

All in all, ayahuasca represents a unique plant-based medicine. The fact that its traditional use by Amazonian Indians has survived the continual influence of Western acculturation is testimony to the central and important role it has in their world-view. In fact, in many Amazonian tribes the first thing the parents will give a newborn baby is a drop of ayahuasca - right in the mouth. To them it is the supreme medicine, and a true gift from the gods.

176 30 ed4 TRP 4 So Where the Hell is Hyperspace? Everyone's talking about it, but how do we get there? James Kent Hyperspace - 1.) An accelerated or excited space. 2.) Any dimension above and beyond 3-D spacetime (commonly referred to as "reality"). So when looking for hyperspace, we would be searching for any space or dimension that exists above and beyond the reality we normally perceive. Many scholars, mathematicians, and mystics have spent many lifetimes attempting to discover exactly what and where hyperspace actually is, but the main problem of hyperspace is that you can't actually see it. You can't even poke at it. No matter how fervently or convincingly you argue or attempt to prove its existence, you can never really know if it's actually there.

Okay, so maybe that's hyperbole.

The truth is, if we had enough energy (and I'm talking about a lot of energy) we could conceivably open some kind of vortex to hyperspace. However, even if we had the energy of 100 suns to dedicate to this project, all we would get is a shaky, unstable, minuscule singularity barely the width of a photon. What would we do with that? Anything that went in would probably never come out, and the area around the singularity would bend and warp and cause all kinds of messy temporal and spacial distortions. Nope, unless our current sources of generating energy improve dramatically hyperspace will remain out of our physical reach. And because our senses are wired to perceive such a narrow spectrum of reality, it would seem we are forever banished to exist solely in the hard cold world of 3-D spacetime. 

However, what if there were a way to experientially reproduce the phenomenon of existing in higher dimensional states? What if instead of bending space itself we could somehow bend the perceptual boundaries that limit our view of reality? What if there was some switch we could throw to blow open our default data-gathering settings so we could start receiving information on broadband instead of narrow-spectrum? Would you want to throw that switch? Would you want to take a look into hyperspace?

Of course you would. Who wouldn't?

There are only two good reasons I can think of why somebody would shy away from the experience of having their perceptual veils lifted. The first is that they are scared of what they might find. The mere thought of having one's ontology shattered into a million pieces at the flip of the switch can be somewhat jarring, no doubt. The second reason I can think of for refusing the experience is that it may be considered a cultural taboo. Either of these cases on its own would be good enough reason to avoid such things, but when the two forces are combined &#151; ontological uneasiness and social pressures &#151; they spell outright fear.

So what's so scary about hyperspace? Does it pose some kind of threat to our way of life? Is it the mythical boundary between life and death? Does it cross that thin line between reality and fantasy land, sanity and insanity? Does it hold secrets that mere mortals were never meant to behold? Whatever it is, it is a force to be reckoned with, and not to be stepped into lightly.

Of the many ways people have attempted to grok hyperspace over the last few millennia, possibly the most interesting and controversial method has been the ingestion of DMT. DMT is not just another psychedelic drug to be studied and cataloged. No, it may very well be the Holy Grail to hyperspace so many have been looking for. Neurochemically speaking, DMT is like a synaptic skeleton key to hyper-consciousness. It is similar in structure to serotonin and other common neurotransmitters, and it fits in very nicely at most major receptor sites. When the neural matrix is suddenly flooded with this sublime substance, it is akin to having all of your neural switches instantaneously flipped on all at once. The effects are so dramatic that they are overwhelming, and some might even say astonishing. 

When I tried DMT for the first time, it's true I was a bit startled. I was not expecting the substance of what I saw to be so real. I had the exhilarating feeling that I was fully awake for possibly the first time in my life. My eyes and ears were opened to a dimension of vision and sound that I could never have imagined existed. It was not just hallucination or simple perceptual distortion &#151; that would have been easy to cope with. What I experienced was more like perceptual amplification and magnification, a full awakening of the senses. I could suddenly see jeweled detail and temporal depth in everything I looked at. Objects no longer held the illusion of solidity, but revealed themselves as distinct vibrational fields in constant transition through time. It was a life-changing experience, and one that has led me to remark that DMT may be "the single most exquisite substance on the entire planet."

What do I mean by that? Well, for starters, I never really comprehended just how complex and mysterious reality was until I first smoked DMT. I had received vague inklings of cosmic depth and quick glimpses into hidden forces via other transcendent experiences in my lifetime, but never had I witnessed the intricate processes which hold reality together on such a visceral level. Sub atomic, molecular, genetic, electromagnetic, and cosmic forces all became explicit before my eyes. These were no longer abstract concepts, but actual processes unfolding in real-time before my eyes. It was &#151; how shall I say &#151; heavy.

So with that heaviness in mind, let us step into the world of DMT and the bizarre hyperspace it evokes. These pages contain a multitude of new insights and new information into the understanding of this awe-inspiring chemical from some of today's most noted scholars. We may think that we are a fairly advanced civilization, but we are only now beginning to peel away at the thin layers of our reality. I doubt anyone is fully ready for what we will find, but I have no doubt that DMT is one of the keys to breaking through this barrier. The voyage has only but begun.

179 30 salvia_au 5.31.2002 Salvia Divinorum Outlawed in Australia An Update from the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics Made possible by
the <a href="http://www.alchemind.org/salvia_defense_fund.htm" target="new">Salvia Divinorum Defense Fund</a> 

 

Effective June 1, Australia becomes the first country to make the plant Salvia divinorum a prohibited drug. Pursuant to a ruling by Australia's National Drugs And Poisons Schedule Committee (NDPSC), both Salvia divinorum and its active principle salvinorin A, will be added to Schedule 9 of Australia's Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons (SUSDP). Australia's action raises fears that other governments may soon follow suit.

 

Schedule 9 is Australia's most restrictive drug schedule, and includes "substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities."

 

Under Australian law, drug control is a state rather than a federal issue. Thus the NDPSC's decision is technically only a recommendation to Australia's states and territories to prohibit both S. divinorum and salvinorin A. It is practically unheard of, however, for states to deviate from the NDPSC's rulings. Accordingly it is a fait accompli that the possession, distribution, or cultivation of S. divinorum and salvinorin A will now be considered a criminal offense in all of Australia.

 

The Alchemind Society's Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics has been in contact with a group of scientific researchers in Australia who are working to challenge the NDPSC's ruling and block its adoption by the various states and territories. So far these efforts have been unsuccessful.

 

Australia's scheduling of S. divinorum raises concerns that the US DEA, which is known to be evaluating the plant for scheduling, may be spurred to prohibit the plant as well. In anticipation of similar action by the DEA, the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics (CCLE) has established a SALVIA DIVINORUM DEFENSE FUND for the purpose of raising the money necessary to present a legal challenge to any scheduling move by the DEA. In October of last year, a group of experts coordinated by the CCLE submitted a written report to the US DEA, finding that Salvia divinorum does not meet the criteria for inclusion in Schedule I of the US Controlled Substance Act.

The CCLE continues to monitor Salvia divinorum's legal situation on a daily basis. With your support, we will be able to mount a legal challenge to a future scheduling move by the US DEA.

Additional Details about the Australian Scheduling Decision



The NDPSC's decision to place the S. divinorum and its active principle into Schedule 9 – a schedule reserved for drugs with a "high potential for abuse" and which present a "risk to public health and safety" – appears to have no factual support. 

At its August 2001 meeting, The NDPSC considered scheduling S. divinorum, noting that the plant was being "advertis[ed] for sale in Australia and some broad based e-mail discussion groups on Australian web sites have included discussion threads on Salvia divinorum." 

Traditional shamanic use of the plant was discounted by the NDPSC, which dismissively commented, "There was no evidence of traditional therapeutic use other than in shamanistic healing rituals."

Finally, while placement in Schedule 9 requires a finding that the plant or substance presents a public health problem, the NDPSC made an end-run around this important criterion, stating:

 "The Jurisdictions advised the Committee that they had not been advised that this herb was causing public health problems, however this may simply reflect the relative "newness" of the herb as a potential substance of abuse."

The NDPSC concluded its August 2001 meeting by noting: "there appear[s] to be a prima facie case for control of Salvia divinorum as an hallucinogen, but ... there was no evidence of a major public health hazard at this stage. Accordingly, the Committee agreed to foreshadow appropriate Schedule 9 entries and seek public comment

At its next meeting, held in November 2001, the NDPSC noted "there was no response to the pre-meeting gazette notice in relation to the foreshadowed decision to include Salvia Divinorum in Schedule 9 of the SUSDP. However, a Minute was received from the Office of Complementary Medicines of the TGA, thanking the Committee for considering the inclusion of S. divinorum into the SUSDP on public health and safety grounds."

Yet, with no more evidence than what existed (or didn't exist) in August 2001, the NDPSC then summarily ruled (Decision 2001/33-7) to include "Salvia Divinorum in Schedule 9 of the SUSDP, on the basis of high potential for abuse and risk to public health and safety." 

In addition, the NDPSC included in Schedule 9 "8-METHOXYCARBONYL-4A,8A-DIMETHYL-6-ACETOXY- 5-KETO-3,4,4B,7,9,10,10A-SEPTAHYDRO-3-(4-FURANYL)- 2,1-NAPHTHO[4,3-E]PYRONE *(SALVINORIN A)."

181 30 erikdavisms2 from Trip6 Psychedelic Culture: One or Many? Erik Davis What I'd like to do here is paint a picture of psychedelic culture and how it relates to the larger world that we're in. There are a lot of interesting angles with which people approach psychedelic culture. Of course there've always been very different models of how psychedelics influence the greater culture - how they should influence it, and how they do influence it. If you go back to the Sixties, sometimes we have a simplistic idea that the counterculture was one great wave of psychedelic experience that was united in its ethos, in its ways of thinking about what way the world should go. That's not really the case. There were a lot of very different subsets of people, even at that time. You had people driven very much by a kind of psychotherapeutic approach - how is this going to help in dealing with individual psychology, and the psychology of groups. You had the sort of elitist perennialism of Aldous Huxley and his school. On the other side of it, you had the Prankster approach, which was far more anarchic - let's throw it all out there and see what happens, let's spread it wide, let's bring it all down. You had the great tensions between, especially in the Seventies, Timothy Leary and Ram Dass. At some point in the Sixties, Leary was often seen as sort of a semi-guru guy, but at a certain point he really very strongly turned away from that model, from the custard mush of Hindu spirituality, and became much more invested in a kind of proto-extropian, highly technological view of the future of humanity. Whereas on the other hand, you had his former colleague, Richard Alpert, really keeping the connections between psychedelic experience and a variety of mystical and spiritual traditions very closely bound. 

So even if we look at the background of where we've come from, we see a lot of divergence. And today we also have a great deal of divergence. You have people who are very scientifically oriented and in many ways quite skeptical of the kinds of claims you can make about the worlds of experience that psychedelics open up. On the other hand, you have a very strong pull towards religion and/or spirituality in certain kinds of forms; there's the idea that there are certain spirits behind these experiences, that they have a kind of collective message, and that by engaging in this we're learning a certain kind of truth which is organized often by certain institutions or groups. This divergence of course is extremely productive. It's very dynamic; it's very open-ended. The best aspect of psychedelic culture in terms of what it presents to the larger culture is this open-endedness, a lack of resolution, a constant dynamic interplay between matter and spirit, science and experience, subjectivity and chemistry. That tension of constantly moving relationships is in many ways what makes this such a productive and fascinating part of our culture. 

But what does "psychedelic culture" mean? In the broader respects, in many ways you can look outside and say that psychedelics won. If you look at advertising, if you look at MTV, if you look at computer graphics, if you look at a lot of things inside of the emerging cybersphere, you will find traces and sometimes overt quotations of psychedelic experience and psychedelic culture. I'm sure if you took some of the advertisements you see for soda pop and international financial institutions back to 1967 and said, "Check this out," they'd say, "Wow, that's the stuff." And that's a fascinating tale. If we ever know - and I do hope someday we know -the extent of the influence of psychedelics on the computer industry, I'm sure it's remarkable. And we know some of what that is, but for obvious reasons, it's a story that remains untold. I was talking to Lawrence Hagerty [author of "The Spirit of the Internet: Speculations on the Evolution of Global Consciousness"] who was talking about how Sun Microsystems is beating the pants off some of the other monsters out there, and Sun is one major corporation out there that doesn't do drug testing. Very interesting [applause] 

So clearly the ideas and experiences of this culture are trickling out and they have all sorts of influences that are hard to trace. What really interests me is how this psychedelic experience and psychedelic thinking can engage with the world that we're moving into, a much broader and very strange and rapidly changing world. 

SHAMANISM

What's a nice, traditional, solid model of the function of psychedelics within a larger culture? We have the great image of the shaman, a very romanticized image, very overwritten in many ways, used to mean many different things outside of its original ethnographic context. I'm not going to go into any specifics about particular shamanic cultures, but I would like to draw sort of a general picture to point out something I think is very important about psychedelic culture. One thing you can say about the shaman or witch is that she lives on the edge of cultural maps. The shaman can be seen as a kind of interface between the specific human culture of a particular tribal group and the world outside, a world that we can think of not only as nature, of course, but the cosmic, the spiritual. The witch lives at the edge of the village as we start to move into the wild. And that's a very potent way of thinking about that relationship of being a transfer point between the outside and the inside of specific human cultures. One of those interesting paradoxes of shamanism is that, on the one hand, it is very technological, very savvy, full of knowledge in almost a modern sense of knowledge, like scientific knowledge. And yet the worlds that are being produced and performed are extremely cultural, spiritual, mythological. Look at a healing ceremony, and think about what exactly is happening in a healing ceremony. Let's say that the illness is healed through the use of quartz crystals being pulled out of the body.  What's happening there? What's really going on?

One way of looking at it is that the shaman is playing a two-fold game. On the one hand, he knows very well what he's actually doing, that he's pirated a little quartz crystal in his palm, that he's using very specific plants which have very specific properties which engaged together can produce effects, both specifically related to health and in larger psychoactive issues as well. There's a tremendous amount of knowledge there. And yet, what does the shaman do in the actual situation of the healing? She performs. And what she performs is a whole cultural embeddedness of those knowledges, not simply as in our modern science - "take this pill, it'll work out for you." The knowledge is kept on the inside. And what the person perceives is a cultural story, of the illness being removed from the body. So it's not that the shaman is a skeptical trickster just playing games with quartz crystals. It's that the shaman understands some of the technology of producing cultural knowledge and transformation within that cultural matrix, and is willing to perform it as if it were fully engaged. We're realizing now that the placebo effect plays a tremendous role in healing of all sorts. And so to artfully produce the placebo effect is of course an incredibly valuable activity. 

But again, what is the function here? The shaman takes a sort of liminal role. Liminality is a concept in anthropology that describes, again, a place on the edge of cultural maps, a place between the wild and the culture, between hot and cold, between different villages. A place of tremendous liminal power in the ancient world were crossroads. Crossroads were where people from different cultures would encounter each other. And there's a whole mythology of trickster figures - Hermes, Coyote, these kinds of characters - are figures that model this relationship between inside and out. Liminality is a very important way of approaching what function, what role, what space in the whole overall cultural environment psychedelics take up. 

So if you look at this model, it's a very exciting model. Of course, many people in attempting to really take advantage of psychedelic drugs in the modern world have looked to the model of shaman healer. It's an exciting model to try to emulate in some fashion or another. But there's one very important distinction, I believe, between the world view of the traditional shaman healer and what we are faced with, which is that we do not have a coherent, contained world view. We no longer have a specific cultural story that can be performed in that mythological sense. We're at this very strange juncture in history when all these cultures are smashing into each other, we have globalization, we have fragmentation, it's a very open-ended situation. I think sometimes if there's an error in the shamanic interpretation of modern psychedelic culture, it's a kind of romanticism that wants to reconstruct or re-embody some fully coherent mythological world view. I don't want to say that in a way that undercuts the power of ancient myths and ancient knowledge. Of course one of the things that composes modern psychedelic culture is knowledges, is reception of stories, practices from the world over, and those things inform our evolving picture or cultural story about what we're doing, because that cultural story helps make the reality of experience come to be. But I think that sometimes there's a desire or a tendency to want that story to be fully realized, so that we know that actually what we're doing is engaging the mind of the planet, and the planet is telling us something. And I think in some ways those are very valuable stories, but at the same time, I think it's very important to recognize that, at the moment, we are still part of this tremendous, bizarre, horrible and fascinating process of technological modernity. We can see it breaking apart. We can see its horrible claws, its absences, and there's a desire to overcome these things quickly, or overcome them fully or entirely, leave that framework entirely in order to enter into a different kind of re-enchanted world. That desire to re-enchant the world is a profound thing that we're all feeling. It's incredibly legitimate. And yet, I think that the way in which we move forward with that is not by recovering simply a kind of mythological world view. We must keep up our relationship with those aspects of modernity that are part of psychedelic culture. 

SCIENCE

One of the more obvious models, of course, is science. And one of the paradoxes if you approach psychedelics from a scientific point of view is that on the one hand, obviously we're dealing with material substances. Obviously we're dealing with chemistry. We're dealing with tiny little objects that we can describe in the institutionalized, image-free language of science. And yet, these compounds open up worlds which seem to pull the rug out from under a more limited view of science. And yet, and yet, we cannot fully inhabit the magical, open-ended world, because we are also very much aware of the fact that they are material compounds, produced through material means that are playing all sorts of games and fascinating tricks on our neural systems. So it's a kind of Möbius strip, where the trigger opens up the space that pulls out the rug from under the whole world of triggers, the whole world of mechanism. And yet, we can't entirely resolve that, we can't leave the world where we're still acknowledging the tremendous complexity and marvels of natural science. So that's why psychedelics, more than most regions of the culture, are a place for getting very close to this magic line, where it's almost a tight rope walk between these different world views. 

Another very important aspect about psychedelics, from the perspective of more materialist and scientific ways of looking at the world, is the question it poses about consciousness, and whether first-person perspectives have any value in our attempts to understand what consciousness is. There's a tremendous amount of energy amongst the people who are doing the most work to describe what's happening in consciousness from the perspective of the brain. There's a tremendous tendency in that world to deny first-person experience as a valid way of understanding what's happening in consciousness; we can only really talk about it from a third-person perspective. Someone like Daniel Dennett is a great example of this, where any sort of internal information you get from meditation, from drugs, etc., it's just not really worth very much because we can't really capture it entirely in the kinds of frameworks that science prefers. But that's what makes it so powerful and so productive, because it's like we're opening up a gate inside of the scientific worldview, but what comes in that gate cannot be captured by it entirely. We see the same kinds of things happening now, as there's more discussion of a sort of neurology of mysticism or spiritualism, like the cover of Newsweek recently on "God and the brain." It's again a very similar kind of topic. Interestingly, they did not raise the issue of psychedelics at all. But they were approaching this odd point where we're beginning to get pretty good at a third-person description of a lot of what's going on with some of the most exalted and powerful states that human beings can achieve. And yet, there's something sort of obvious: if we're getting so close to it from this third-person perspective, how can we possibly not include a first-person perspective? 

But then it actually feeds into an aspect of our culture that is very frightening, which is a certain tendency towards control, towards the idea that what causes human beings to be the way they are are a whole set of factors that can be controlled from the outside, for the interests of this kind of way of thinking. You find it in government, you find it in science, you find it in psychotherapy, you find it in motivational speaking, you find it in all sorts of places, this tendency to say, "Well, all you have to do is trigger human beings a certain way and they will be happy or they will be productive in a capitalist sense." And so the tendency to think about consciousness from a strictly third-person point of view also plays very much into the hands of the people who believe they can use third-person perspectives in order to organize such activity. Whereas if you stepped across that line and said, "This is absurd, of course I'm going to plunge in with my own individual consciousness and make inferences, make discoveries, explore myself, explore social interaction from the perspective of these new states," you're already just in that investigation making a claim for the primary importance of subjective experience as a place to instruct, to understand, and to relate to the world. So that's another way in which psychedelics have a very interesting trickiness, because even from the perspective of hard core third-person scientists, they're inevitably fascinated by these compounds on some level or another. And yet, the closer you get to these substances, the more they pull you into a very different kind of world. It becomes more difficult to account for the phenomenon from that perspective. So it's sort of eating in and eroding some of the more regressive and reductive tendencies inside of brain science.

SET & SETTING

These compounds pull the rug out from under from simple mechanistic cosmology. We all know about set and setting. Set and setting have a tremendously powerful role in producing experience. But set and setting are not mechanistic activities. They're cultural elements. They're narrative elements. They have to do with meaning. So by going into a psychedelic experience, even from a skeptical point of view, anyone who's really investigating the phenomenon will recognize that your own mind frame, and your own physical setting, will help produce the different qualities of the events. So there's no way to fully account for that from the perspective of brain science alone. You have to go to culture. You have to go to the shaman's performance, the fact that it looks like I'm pulling a quartz crystal out of your body at some point or another. So it opens up this whole problem or issue of self-programming, programming environment, intentionality. And all of those elements, especially intentionality, are precisely the elements that are extremely vital for us to keep at the center of our vision as we move into what I often fear is a fairly concerted attack on certain kinds of individual liberties and the liberties of consciousness itself.

But again, there's kind of an interesting problem, which is the same thing that I talked about with the shamanic worldview. If we were in a traditional society, the framework, the intention, the set and setting would be a given. We are brought up in it, we already know to some extent what's going on, what's going to happen with these experiences, and they are organized and explained and integrate us, because we already have that map. We've grown up into it, it's in the background, and maybe the shaman is a technician of culture, aware of how to maintain that cultural reality to some degree, using things that are maybe not included in that cultural reality, even using tricks to maintain that perception for the tribe. But we don't have that option any more. So what do we do? What is our intention? What is the frame? What is the set and setting that we organize? These are very big questions.

THE CORPORATE STATE

How does the liminal role of psychedelics fit into our world in terms of policy, in terms of the law? It's interesting to look at the role of psychedelic culture within the larger picture of drugs as constructed by the state, or by the concurrent consensus reality. What interests me is that in some ways, it's not a bad thing. And I don't mean that to say that it's not bad that people are being incarcerated and having their lives ruined. Obviously major suffering goes down and I'm not talking about that. What I'm trying to say is that nonetheless, it puts psychedelic culture in a very curious place inside the larger cultural framework. It has some very productive qualities to it.

One of those is that it avoids some of the traps that occur with any sort of mainstream or corporate or state-oriented recuperation of psychoactive substances. This really came to me in an interesting way. I'm not entirely sure I believe myself on this one, but I do think it's an interesting issue to raise. When Rick Doblin [founder and president of MAPS] was talking about his plan to get MDMA made legal [at the Lindesmith Center-Drug Policy Foundation's "The State of Ecstasy" conference], it was a very sophisticated, very interesting plan. But when he was presenting it, at the end of his presentation he was casting his vision of these "Ecstasy clinics," where people would go and they would be legitimate, and you'd have nice paintings and everything would be set up, and you'd have these kind people who'd be helping you through these sorts of experiences. I kind of had this weird feeling inside. I had this little strange kind of shiver, of like, "Okay, but I don't know that that's all of it." And the reason I say that is that one of the things I think is going to happen - it's already happening, you see it all over the place - is this transformation of the corporate culture of psychoactivity and psychoactive drugs. If you look at Prozac, if you look at Ritalin, you see that there is a willingness inside of civilization or whatever you want to call this particular monster, to willingly use powerful psychoactive drugs in order to restore certain models of normal behavior, certain models of happiness, certain models of satisfaction. And there's nothing wrong with happiness or satisfaction. There's nothing wrong with recognizing profoundly dysfunctional behaviors and finding ways, even very technological ways, of overcoming those behaviors. Nonetheless, there is something that happens when those activities and those possibilities become incorporated into the state. And by the state, I don't just mean the government. I mean the kind of large corporate state that we live in. And so there's a profound difference between decriminalization and legalization. And we're not anywhere near a point where we're going to be able to deal with these things. At the moment, people are suffering and we have to fight that battle, and again I'm not talking about keeping things the way they are. But what I am talking about is that I don't think it's an accident that psychedelics occupy this curious position

MDMA is a very different category in a lot of ways. MDMA is operating again in a very liminal space, between the crazy world of psychedelics that must be suppressed - those wild and crazy kids, those nuts from California - and Prozac. So you start to see mainstream media going, "This stuff's not so bad!" The New York Times, Time magazine: "Hmm, you know, it's not that different from the serotonin-based SSRIs and such."  But one of the things about that is because Ecstasy by itself, though incredibly productive and marvelous in so many ways, does not puncture consensus reality the way psychedelics puncture consensus reality. And so I don't think it's an accident that it's in this zone, because in some ways you can imagine a reorganization of our current environment in which Ecstasy is somehow integrated. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just that as soon as you start to integrate it, then it becomes manipulated by that cultural machine, which has agendas that have nothing to do necessarily with you feeling better, with you discovering more love and intimacy in your life. It becomes a regulatory mechanism, a way of managing human subjectivity in an increasingly dense and chaotic and open-ended social environment.

So in some ways, psychedelics have a very interesting place because they're not integrated into that world. And for me, one of the things that is the most productive and full of potential about them is that they're going to puncture your consensus reality. They're going to knock you out of whatever that structure is, even in terms of your models of healing, even in terms of your models of deeper interconnection with nature. You think you're going to get the great earth momma embracing you in some kind of jaguar-rich forest, and you get sucked into some sort of interdimensional wormhole built by malevolent-looking insectoid creatures, and you go, "Man, I was going for the nature vibe sort of thing!" That's great. It's that pulling the rug out from under you. And so it's very interesting to look at the difference between MDMA and psychedelic culture in that sense.

RELIGION & SPIRITUALITY

The final zone I want to talk about in terms of this liminality is religion or spirituality. A good example of something analogous to where we are in terms of the role of psychedelics in our spiritual/religious quest today from history is to look at the mystery religions of late antiquity. Many people have drawn what I think are very valid connections between the last few centuries of the Roman Empire, and our world now. You have a potentially globalized environment full of huge varieties of different kinds of people, a sort of mechanized state that is very efficient but utterly corrupt at the top. You have a very urban environment, in which many different kinds of people are coming together, and people are pulled out of their tribal connections to the places they come from. There's a lot more movement in the empire. And it's in this environment that you see the rise of the mystery religions. Not particularly the famous mystery religion of Eleusis, which is a very important part of our psychedelic story, but was actually much older than most of these mystery religions. But it was more the sense that the way to serve this spiritual hunger was to enter into these cult sects, where at the heart of the whole operation was an experience, an otherworldly experience. And they were not by any means all produced by psychoactive substances; in fact, I don't think you necessarily need very much psychoactive substances involved in the production of these kinds of mystical experiences in order for them to be very heavy and transformative. And yet there was a desire for this kind of experience, for a sense of the self that went beyond the body, that was very similar to now. 

So it's interesting to think about how we relate to this model of the mystery religions. I see an unfortunate reductive tendency of some psychedelic research, particularly the historical stuff, to find behind all of these vast mysteries of religions across the globe some kind of substance that's "actually" producing things. We know there's something going on with soma, we know there's something going on with Eleusis, we know that stuff is going on, and there's little fragments of it here and there, and we want to reconstruct what is actually going on. In this way, we're very modern still. We're still looking for the mechanism. We're still looking for the actual substance that allows these things to be. It's my belief that once you take into account the way that cultural reality can program or set up a certain set of expectations, a certain set of experiences, then you actually don't need many chemicals thrown into the mix in order to produce a tremendously powerful experience, and I always find it unfortunate when in some psychedelic historiography, it's almost saying, "Real spirituality is the psychedelic experience, and everything else we see is a pale reflection of it, some attempt to recapture it using some longer, slower, more painful method, or leaving aside the methods, you just have some crusty, dogmatic ideology that is the leftover of this living spiritual experience." I mean, in some ways I think that's probably an accurate description in a lot of respects, but I think it also misses a lot, and one of the things it does is it cuts against our willingness to look at what those cultural frameworks are, what the stories are that are embedded in these experiences. By overly emphasizing the "secret mushroom" behind all of the iconography or all of the lore, I think we tend to undercut the role of meaning, the role of our ongoing cultural frameworks in producing these experiences.

Another issue that's raised by the mystery religions is the larger question about what is the role of experience spiritually in the first place? There's a fairly consensus idea that we have spirituality over here, we have religion over there, and they kind of overlap. Spirituality on whatever level is about your experiences: what's actually happening, how you're becoming more integrated, your mystical experiences, the real deal, the immediacy of spirit. Whereas religion we tend to associate very justly with institutional frameworks, with collective stories, with power relations, with manifest social relationships. And there's this curious sort of balance between the two. What you have with a traditional mystery religion is that at the heart of it, there is something like gnosis. Maybe it's produced through a substance, maybe not. But there is an experience, a profound experience of the divine, of the otherworldly. And yet, again, it is embedded in this whole set of stories and frameworks, which a) help produce the shape of those experiences, and b) even more importantly, help integrate the residue of those experiences into ordinary life. 

So there's a tendency, a very strong one and very understandable, inside of psychedelic spirituality, to say, "This stuff is getting us to the goods, now we can skip all that 'religion' stuff and get right to the heart of it. We can go spiritual, we don't need religion in the broadest and most positive sense of the word." But I'm not entirely sure that that sums up the issue, because again I think without a certain kind of framework for understanding and integrating, then the spiritual experience, even the most profound state of gnosis, can become a kind of wacky hedonism. Nothing wrong with hedonism. But you probably people know people like this, or you can see it in the culture very much, where any kind of substance that you're taking in a de-mythologized environment where you're buying a piece of blotter or you're taking a pill, however you try to frame it, it can become just a mechanistic repetition. It can lose any edge of genuine openness and integration. 

But I don't have an answer for this, because I don't know what these frames are. I don't know what the big maps are. I tend to be very distrustful of people who know what the big map is. They "know" what the story is that's organizing these experiences. We can see, for example, if you look at some Brazilian ayahuasca sects, there are some very interesting things that are happening there from a religious anthropology perspective. And yet, it doesn't take much interaction with them to see things that at least from a Western perspective are difficult: institutional hierarchies, ways of saying what's a good experience, what's a bad experience, what is the meaning of all this, and answering those questions beforehand becomes somewhat authoritarian in a traditional religious way. So it can have a great deal of social power and actually aid people in a lot of ways, and yet I think a lot of us in psychedelic culture are uncomfortable with that. So once again this is that "in betwixt, in between": we know there are frames, we know that by accepting and creating a spiritual environment, a spiritual story, the experiences themselves will have a much greater richness. (I mean, sometimes they'll just come in and do whatever they're going to do anyway, but that is very much a part of it.) And yet, what is our frame? What really is the story we're telling ourselves? I don't have an answer for that, but it fascinates me very much that there is something to the need to produce these cultural frameworks. 

And I'm not sure whether the kinds of frameworks that we have so far are sufficient. If you look at them, what are the two main ones you can talk about? One of them is the therapeutic model. Again, incredibly productive, and yet I'm not always so sure whether that is getting at the real heart of the spiritual potential of these molecules. Another example is rave culture. That's probably the best example of a kind of mass movement with a great deal of cultural power, within which people are having tremendous psychoactive experiences, and which is organized in a certain way to produce trance effects, to suggest certain kinds of images which are keying off archetypes, the drugs really plug into the music and the music plugs into the drugs, as an example of the way that technology and the drug states are really mirroring each other and as they evolve, they sort of co-create these environments. Again, they're incredibly rich and productive in some ways, and yet in other ways I don't think you have to be too much of a worrywart to look at some aspects of rave culture, and wonder, what are they doing? What is this for? What's going on here? There's always that tendency, particularly in our culture, to have things turned into a form of entertainment or a form of numbing yourself. 

And so the question I always ask myself is: How can you communicate the best aspects of "psychedelic values"? There are certain kinds of psychedelic values that many people develop after a long apprenticeship with these things. I mean, I know I've met individuals from older generations, and there's just certain things you pick up, a certain kind of openness, a certain kind of tolerance, a certain kind of sweetness, a certain kind of mirth that really strikes me as part of these values. They're almost unspoken. How do you transmit these? Is there a way to transmit them? Is it all just out of control? As soon as you start to try to control it, then you make it more like religion, you make it more like "this is the right way and this is the wrong way." And yet, in some ways the chaotic effects of introducing these things at an increasingly mass level are worrying. 

So again, I don't have a lot of answers. But I really just wanted to paint a big picture, throwing out some questions that I know will be approached from a variety of different ways within our culture. Of course, one of the good things about the old mystery religions and that kind of model is that they're esoteric. There's levels of secrecy. And so in order to work yourself up to the encounter, the experience, you have to go through a lot of social machinery, a lot of preparation, a lot of preparing yourself for not really necessarily knowing what goes on. And that structure also allows the production of wisdom people, whether you call them shamans, whether you call them masters, whatever you want to call people who know their stuff, who know these worlds inside and out, but there's a way that that knowledge passes on. There's apprentices, and those apprentices are able to reproduce those environments, changing them always slightly as the culture itself transforms. Now we're in an information environment, where that kind of hermeticism still goes on, and it's vital that it does go on - most secret elite pockets are vital to the continual creation of this culture and its encounters with psychoactives. But it's also the case that the genie is seriously out of the bottle. It's much easier in some senses to "get" things, to pluck on the information networks and come up with a lot of very powerful information, that in a more traditional society would be highly guarded by the wacky alchemists, the witch at the edge of the village. Now it's all open. That raises some really interesting ethical issues.

184 30 shakatura01 Trip 8 Extra Shakatura Interview Galen Butler talks about his first CD release under the name Shakatura James Kent <b>TRIP</b>: So who is Shakatura? Is it just one person?

<b>GB</b>: Shakatura is a thread in the magik carpet of Bay Area musicians, artists, dancers, activists and healers committed to raising a positive vibe for anyone in range. It is an artistic costume worn primarily by Galen Butler but shared among various musical and artistic collaborators. It was conjured and is being developed as a magikal mainline to the healing powers of music and dance.

<b>TRIP</b>: How long have you been making music?

<b>GB</b>: My earliest musical memory is of playing a kid's drum covered with dayglo orange funfur at about age 5. This was a clear sign of how things would unfold later. Guitar came into the picture during high school and there was much epic psy-fi noodling and whiteboy jambalaya in subsequent years. A computer-based studio started taking shape in 1996. The idea of painting
with a limitless digital palette of sounds really appealed to me in a way that no single traditional instrument ever had. It was like my imagination had finally found it's native tool.

In 1998, I was playing guitar and electronics in a SF-based rock project called Dreamspy. This band was a sort of initial run at fusing the kind of acid and progressive rock we'd cut our teeth on with contemporary electronic textures and dance floor punch. It was a tall order, one which the band didn't survive long enough to fill, though we were pointed in the right direction. This sort of "organic-electronic" live dance band concept is still a vision of mine. In the Bay Area, acts like Sound Tribe Sector 9, Lost at Last and Medicine Drum, among others, are honing different spins on this idea.

<b>TRIP</b>: What first inspired you to make this particular CD?

<b>GB</b>: I moved to California from New England in 1996 and became immediately submerged in San Francisco's dance music culture, especially the psychedelic trance scene. The color and energy of this music really absorbed me for a good three or four years. In parallel, artists like Mixmaster Morris, Adham Shaikh and Simon Posford were releasing some beautifully sophisticated ambient dub music that was really accessing beautiful and powerful spaces. So as I started putting tracks together, I suppose they landed somewhere on the periphery of these immediate influences. I wanted to make an album that had dance floor elements and lush headphone appeal as well. Within the electro-funk-dub stylistic mishmash on the album, there's something for the body, something for the mind, something for the spirit; that kind of thing.

It's a wonderful thing when music can effect people on different levels and really open the whole organism. This is what I'm trying to do with music - open up and let it pour though from the highest and funkiest and most healing sources available.

<b>TRIP</b>: What gear/software did you use to create the tracks on Shakatura?

<b>GB</b>: The music on the first CD came together gradually at the stormy confluence of sonic inspiration and technical pro wrestling. The studio was in serious flux over the course of the album's production. A lot of vintage analog synths and a bunch of newer digital synths and samplers were involved. The production environment used on Shakatura was Steinberg's Cubase VST on a Macintosh. I haven't played a synthesizer I like more than the Access Virus B for range and sound quality. I use a EMu rack module as a Swiss army knife of drum sounds and samples. A Studio Electronics ATC-1 serves up the pure analog butter and cream.

Of course it helps tremendously to play a traditional instrument, and have friends who play instruments. Electronic music has created a range of new musical aesthetics that completely discard any traditional instrumental tones and ensembles we're used to hearing in favor of a completely synthetic sound. Personally, I'm into fusion and integration of electronic and traditional instrumentation and I think this comes across on the album.

Seems to me that, beyond the basics, one's choice of particular tools is not as important as one's understanding of them. The computer is the heart of any digital composition system, acting as multi track recorder, sampler, synthesizer, drum machine, and mastering suite. With an average personal computer and a single good synthesizer, the only limitations are time, imagination, and patience.



<b>TRIP</b>: Did you use many samples or was the sound all homegrown?

<b>GB</b>: All the synth sounds were generated in the studio. Some of the samples come from sample disc libraries made for the purpose, some come from field DAT recordings, some from experimental goofing around. Everything audible is fair game if you can record it. This album does not really go as far as I'd like to eventually in terms of mining the world's technosphere and biosphere for interesting sounds. The album is about 85% an electronic studio creation, and it sounds like it. Moving forward, each track and definitely each album release will bump the ceiling of complexity. It has to be this way to stay interesting.

<b>TRIP</b>: What do you call the type of music on this album? Trip house? Organic downtempo? Murky disco? How would you classify it?

<b>GB</b>: Murky disco? A new sub-genre is born! Friends of mine were kicking around the term "psy-hop" a few years ago to describe a fusion of psychedelic trance and hip-hop. This term was describing something super fat and funky; something equally trippy but not as morose or jazzy as a lot of trip hop. The name game is endless of course, especially when you're mixing genres. The music on Shakatura pulls from downtempo electronic, ambient, breakbeat, trance, house, funk, disco, and rock. If there's one thing that's truly unique about it, I'd say it's this stylistic fusion.

<b>TRIP</b>: What's your favorite track on the album and why?

<b>GB</b>: That's a tough one, because I've liked them all best at one time or another. The opening track, "Lava Tube," I think best captures the lush and colorful spirit that surrounded this project. "Quark" is a nice one too. "Playa Mimosa," which opens, by the way, with a field recording from post-burn chaos at Burning Man 2001, will be remixed on the next album. That was the last track made, and the one pointing the direction into the current work.

<b>TRIP</b>: What other CDs are you listening to right now? Got any tips for us?

<b>GB</b>: In my opinion, anything on Interchill Records is really the top of the stack as far as organic-electronic ambient music goes. There are two new compilations coming out on this label within the next few months, and based on the prospective track listings, I'd recommend them both. Meditation2 is also forthcoming on Ceiba Records and will be great as well. There's a little list of enduring releases on the website at <a href="http://www.shakatura.com">shakatura.com</a> in the music section.

<b>TRIP</b>: So you did the cover art for the album as well. It's pretty inspired. You've got some sort of Vedic calendrical mandala, a strand of DNA, pristine rainforests, sacred eye portals... What's going on here?

<b>GB</b>: Well, if you've worked with the Tarot at all, that's how I think about this image. It's a sort of mandala, an integrated collection of symbols which reflect related aspects of the psyche in a (hopefully) meaningful way. As this image was coming together, it became apparent that it was representing the level at which human identity is balanced within the earth's biosphere. The lunar/astrological calendar reminds us that the motion of time is a concert of energy, made of meaning, ultimately beyond cause and effect; that everything is tightly wound in a web of synchronicity on all levels. We can develop awareness of events as synchronic and work with this understanding: in music, in relationships, in work of any kind. The DNA spiral represents the unbroken evolutionary chain and the energetic distillery of life on this planet. It is the single organism differentiated into myriad shapes. When we feel this relationship on a cellular level, a tree or bacteria is literally "another Yourself." The waters, forests and sky represent the interpenetrating levels of the biosphere inhabited by and maintained by this DNA creatrix. The moth wings with floating eyes represent lunar vision, the ability to view and integrate unconscious psychic contents and transhuman energies through fearless interior exploration. The central eye, which is the eye of a human infant, represents transparent vision, the pure unencumbered state of witness to existence, gracefully embodying all potentials. The music sounds really good from this vantage point ;-).

185 30 shakatura Trip 8 Shakatura a groovin' head trip through lush organic downtempo James Kent One artist who fits the image of the modern psychedelic Renaissance man is
San Francisco's Galen Butler, also known as Shakatura. Butler recently released
an eponymous titled debut from Shakatura on Ceiba Records, and it is probably
one of my favorite albums of the year. Grooving with an organic house vibe from
start to finish, Shakatura booms and rolls with lush bass lines, phat breaks,
and swirling synths that bloom and sting with simultaneous hints of Eros and
menace.

While moving through various downtempo moods and spaces Shakatura steps and
swings along with ease, always maintaining an entirely chilled out demeanor,
unafraid to get comfortable in a specific zone and just roll with the flow for a
while. Yet within the meaty grooves lie the deep processes of time passing,
planets spinning, life evolving, each bathed in the ever-present
electro-harmonic radiance that ties it all together. Even when sober there are
parts of Shakatura that leave me envisioning the elegant dance of intracellular
process, the tiny wet machinery of life metabolizing through time at the
bio-molecular level. It is a soothing yet endlessly fascinating pulse, flowing
and combusting along with the organic groove of life. And if your booty stays
still while listening to it you are probably dead.

Although shakatura is hard to classify it is very easy to listen to. It embraces
the best aspects of both downtempo and beatless ambient spaces into tight
organic grooves that keep pumping, moving, and rolling to the end. The entire
album swings with consistent breakbeat chill and trippy soundscapes, and will
definitely enjoy heavy rotation on your sound system.

186 30 duckapus Trip 8 pfly, duckapus experimental ambient spaces, a journey of the mind James Kent One of the greatest things about the psychedelic community is the wide variety
of unique do-it-yourself artists and musicians who populate the scene. Holistic
artists like these typify the values of the renaissance creators, blending
philosophy, technology, music, and art into a tidy package of alchemical sound
and vision, handily compatible with any home CD player and guaranteed to
stimulate any set of eyes and ears the planet.

One such renaissance musician is pfly, also known as Paul Fly. pfly has been
producing underground ambient and experimental tracks for years now, but with
Duckapus, his latest release, he has taken the art form to a new level. Every
snippet of sound on this CD was assembled from the ground up by Fly, mixed and mastered in his own home studio. Even the curiously
enfractaled art on the CD sleeve comes from his desktop, making the entire
package a start-to-finish holographic representation of pfly's head space.

Duckapus is a very strange and unique album, moving through lush organic spaces,
squeaking dissociative noise machinery, and churning caverns of dark mystical
power, each one bubbling over with the potential to explode into states of pure
chaos at any moment. The mind states flow seamlessly from one to other, some
leaving you in the warm folds of sonic bliss, others sending you spiraling into
darkness, others spinning your awareness forty-five degrees in space while
simultaneously giving your light vehicle a two-and-a-half minute lube and tune.

Whether you're being pounded by hammers of insanity or washed over with
electro-harmonic love plasma, the great joy of this album is never knowing where
you're going to end up next. Some transitions are organic and exotic, others
creep out of nowhere and take control, others pass you through hellish corridors
of torment before alighting you into a field of fresh wild flowers at sunrise.
Duckapus leaves you with the sensation that a grand dreamlike voyage has been
undertaken, a skittering surreal journey through the many joys and pains of
existence. Duckapus is also an immaculately crafted album, each passage deep and
complex with simultaneous unfolding and enfoldment of mood and sound. In short
it is a production tour de force, and certainly has the depth to listen to over
and over again, always discovering new glittering snippets and pieces, like tiny
polished gems awash in a great ocean of sound.

609 30 signal_theory Psychedelic Information Theory Signal Theory Overview A technical overview of Signal Theory, a new model of consciousness proposed by James Kent James Kent Signal Theory presents a new model for objectively measuring expanded states of consciousness based on neural firing rate, synchrony of neural spiking, and intensity of signal feedback recursion occurring within the sensory processing circuits of neocortex. Signal Theory also proposes methodologies for mathematically modeling the action of psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonists in the production of diminished, amplified, and standing sensory feedback loops in simple neural circuits. Using the basic tenets of Signal Theory, we can describe an empirical model in which both normal waking consciousness and expanded psychedelic consciousness can be defined. This document is intended to be a brief overview of the basics of Signal Theory, and is for general public review. http://www.tripzine.com/pit/signal_theory.htm Articles Science 3 9 0 0 consciousness brain psychedelic resonant feedback neuroscience recursion neural networks 4 1 tripzine 2006-01-13 16:31:16 0000-00-00 00:00:00 tripzine 0 www.tripzine.com 0 0 0 0 1 James Kent 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 0 0.00 0.00 0 277 2010-05-20 22:33:24

1200 34 1200 www.cdreviews.com CD review: Lewis Taylor - Stoned Lewis Taylor has an interesting story. A modern psychedelic soul singer and producer dedicated to the themes of love and obsession; his one-man compositions likened to past and modern greats like Stevie Wonder, Justin Timberlake, and Prince; and a temperment so moody he is in and out of the music business two times in as many decades leaving little but lauding critical praise and confused fans in his wake?

This may sound like just another "Behind the Music" episode, but listen to Taylor's music (you can find tracks on his Hacktone and MySpace pages listed below) and you realize it is the work of an obsessive perfectionist dedicated to getting his sound just right.

From a recent review on CDReviews.com:

<blockquote>Possibly one of the best pure soul records of the last decade comes from an artist hardly no one has heard about. At least, not on this side of the pond anyway. In England, where Taylor is from, it may be another matter, though he is more of an underground cult star there than an established name.  At one time a guitarist in a revived version of the Edgar Broughton Band in the mid '80's, Taylor would eventually succumb to the temptations of the road and would vanish for a while, mired in a nasty drug and alcohol haze that consumed his career. But not before he released two great psychedelic rock albums under the pseudonym Sheriff Jack. These albums sank without a trace, and Taylor proceeded to vanish for better part of a decade.</blockquote>

His latest US release, <i>Stoned</i> (part one, there is a part two, just not available in the states yet), is not a return to form as much as a perfection of the form Taylor has been striving for all these years away from the spotlight. A right meloncholy wanker prone to fits of solitude and depression, Taylor ranks right up there with Brian Wilson, Nick Drake, and Elliot Smith in the cannon of self-destructive musical geniuses. He's so tempermental that his official website now says he has "retired" from the music business despite being named one of the best artists to watch by Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, and many others who should know. His music makes you feel good, sad, comforted, disturbed, all at the same time. Hauntingly poppy magic, nostalgia in a bottle, so rich and warm I just can't explain. 

While somewhat inconsistent personally, Taylor's music continues to be simultaneously entrancing, cheesy, poppy, emotionally manipulative, clever, and almost always about the ups and downs (mostly downs) of the that thing we call love. Go to Hacktone.com and listen to some more of his tracks and you will hear his anguished soul shine though.

1208 40 Scot45dbcc01a1549 www.ketv.com 'He was high.  He was high.' Apparently people are still occasionally taking PCP and freaking right the hell out:

<blockquote>Zina Ventry said her son had to go by ambulance to a local hospital after he suffered severe frostbite while he was high.

“He came over and flipped out and that's when we knew he was on PCP,” she said. “He was butt naked. He'd been outside with no clothes on for 45 minutes.”

A police report shows that on that day, Robert Vintry had torn off the hair on the right side of his mother's head and smeared his own feces all over his body.

“He was high,” Zina Vintry said. “He was high.”</blockquote>

You don't say.

Later that day, police received reports of a crazy person going door to door with a knife.  When the cops caught up to the 20-year-old, they wound up killing him.  

I guess everyone fights boredom in their own fashion.  For instance:

<blockquote>Suzanne Nord, the clinical director at NOVA -- a drug treatment center in north Omaha -- evaluates people on PCP in jail. She said that on Thursday afternoon, she talked to two teenage boys who had done PCP.

"He and his friends would intentionally smoke this so they could go out and shoot people," Nord said.</blockquote>

They probably only did that when there was no good TV on, but still. http://www.ketv.com/news/10972024/detail.html?rss=oma&psp=news 0 0 0 0 PCP 1 1 Scotto 2007-02-20 22:38:51 2007-02-20 22:38:51 Scotto 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 0 0.00 0.00 0 10 2008-08-13 09:39:21

2262 59 omgo465bb50217c17 www.promicininfo.com The 4400 I live under a rock, so I might just be the last person to find out about this, but I just came across some promotional web sites for a show from a few years back called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4400">The 4400.</a>  Central to the plot is a drug called promicin which, when injected, sometimes gives people superhero powers.  The linked site is a promotional tie-in for the show; it appears to be an up-to-date blog allegedly describing the experiences of people who took the drug and developed powers.  If you are into that sort of thing, you might get a kick out of it, and the other related sites.  The show doesn't appear all that original to me; sort of "Heroes" meets "X-men 3" but probably not as good as either.  Not that I would know.

It appears the sites just went up this month.  I have no idea why, considering the show has been running since 2004. http://www.promicininfo.com/ 0 0 0 0 television show promotion promicin 4400 0 1 omgoleus 2007-05-29 00:10:02 2007-05-29 00:10:02 omgoleus 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 0 0.00 0.00 0 8 2008-08-01 18:07:54

2264 40 2264 news.yahoo.com Whitney Museum gets people high The Whitney Museum in NYC is staging some kind of Summer of Love retrospective, featuring "posters, artwork, light shows, trippy album covers and experimental film from a counter-cultural movement that brought together peace activists, musicians, hippies and artists."  That all sounds fantastic.  But get a load of some of the PR they're trying to push:

<blockquote>"You can experience the 60s and what it might have been taking LSD without actually having to resort to the drug," [curator Christoph Grunenberg] said.</blockquote>

Riiiiiiight.  Yeah, boy, <i>that</i> will sure bring in the commoners.  You'll get whole field trips from teenagers who are ready to push past DXM and, given their lack of an actual acid connection, think that the Whitney might actually do the trick.  Seriously, they're honestly pushing this kind of thing:

<blockquote>"What I think this exhibition hopefully will do is provide intense experiences," he said. "I think that's a critical element of psychedelic art -- the intense experiences."</blockquote>

And what do these intense experiences actually entail?

<blockquote>The exhibition includes several darkened rooms playing light shows of trippy psychedelic patterns and gently rising lava lamp-style swirls, to a soundtrack of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles.</blockquote>

OMG!!!  Why, I own a lava lamp TOO!  I am SO getting super high this weekend!

2268 40 Scot465c2f52c0b10 www.washingtonpost.com All your prescribing is belong to us Here's something I didn't know: 

<blockquote>The American Medical Association... makes millions of dollars each year by helping data-mining companies link prescribing data to individual physicians. It does so by licensing access to the AMA Physician Masterfile, a database containing names, birth dates, educational background, specialties and addresses for more than 800,000 doctors.</blockquote>

What's the end result of all this data mining?  Physicians are now bombarded with information about the utility of new drugs on the market versus drugs they've been comfortable prescribing up until then.  Indeed, companies with competing drugs on the market can be spurred to make sure your doctor gets the latest and greatest data about his preferred drug's side effects, while at the same time learning all about the benefits of a competitor - and maybe get a nice dinner out of it at the same time.  In some cases doctors are mostly being influenced to start prescribing a drug that is more expensive, not necessarily more effective.

Naturally this is squicking some doctors out, but the opt-out for this program is under-advertised and only lasts three years.  Some states are attempting to pass laws, but so far, legislation has failed on grounds like "you can't restrict free speech."  And in theory, it may not be all bad:

<blockquote>The more a drug representative knows about a physician, the easier it is to provide information that meets the needs of the doctor's practice... "We are about more information and more education, and not less....The vast majority of physicians welcome these people as part of the overall educational process about drugs and their use. And any doctor in the country can close the door to these sales reps. It doesn't require legislation to do that."</blockquote>

Painting the whole situation as "the overall educational process about drugs" seems a little bit quaint, as though this isn't actually "the overall sales and marketing process," but I quibble.  You can imagine cases where this atmosphere actually, if not almost inadvertently, creates some benefits for patients; just as easily, it sounds like a surreptitious drug bazaar where doctors are bombarded with competing messages, and only the company that has the best schwag will truly make an impression on patient care. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/21/AR2007052101701.html 0 0 0 0 big pharma, medical care 0 1 Scotto 2007-05-29 08:51:29 2007-05-29 08:51:29 Scotto 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 0 0.00 0.00 0 5 2008-08-01 18:07:54

120 1918 129 papalaterreur 2007-04-21 19:10:51 Mystical...atheist...spiritual...scientist...so many words...
The entheogen experience is highly inneffable and trying to put it in words is out of reach.
I personally encountered Jeremy (a french canadian, like me, who is now in switzerland) and Benny in Basel LSD event, back in january 2006 and I can say, from my personnal feeling, that Jeremy is a lot more 'spiritual' type of man than Benny. 
Benny, a VERY rational mind, is a university teacher and his approach  
is simple...take it, compile a lot of experiences, and write...draw the cartography of the Ayahuasca 'territory'..and, then...try to explain the Experience.
It can be a wonderful and very rewarding adventure but, from my point of view, the Jeremy's  approach,although it is more 'scientific' in his essence,  provides a radically new, and refreshing, vision of the entheogen phenomena. It can shed light on A LOT of insight experienced by generations of fellow psychonauts around the globe. 
Both books are eminently interesting but very differents. Benny's one is a lot more hard to read and gives a complete visit of the 'territory'.
Jeremy's book is short (+- 160 pages) and present a THEORY surrounding the entheogen phenomena...
Personally, I think that his theory is right in the 'bull's eye'...simply because it is...simple and elegant!
Moreover, it put a bridge between biology(dna), photonic (light and the relativity theory)), mythology (the double-serpent as THE FIRST LOGO OF HUMANITY), evolution (the presence of DMT in the pineal gland) and so on..
It is simply TOO NICE!!!
Life is SACRED. It is a GIFT.
The Entheogen Experience is Sacred and will, forever, remain a Mystery. Like it or not.
Jeremy's theory show the way to look at. Light, knowledge and consciousness are intrisically interwoven and leads to the birth of what we called 'REALITY' and LIFE gives us, through the DNA vector, the opportunity to be...ALIVE AND CONSCIOUS.
We are all GOD....but most of us do not remember it.
The entheogen experience is precisely there to remember it to each one who wish to. And Ayahuasca is probably the most 'pure' of all the different types of entheogens.

As in our visual cortex is 'picking something up" that it wouldn't normally, and it doesn't come via the eyes?  What is exactly is a 'photonic resonance'?

552 3335 64 Aumdoc 2007-10-02 07:30:19 I have experience administering atropine/scopolamine injections for nicotine addiction.  I took the job at the clinic two days a month to make some additional income.  I found out about the clinic because my dear friend, S, was successful quitting smoking through the clinic.  I had watched S literally torment himself for 2 years trying to quit smoking.  Every method he could try he did... patches, zyban, coldturkey... all without success.  It wasn't really his trying to quit that got to me, it was more the self recrimination when he failed.

S has quite an interest in plants, especially those with a history of psychotropic human interaction.  Among the many cactii on his back deck there are many tree datura's in pots with beautiful trumpet flowers.  He loves those plants.  To both him and I it seems no small coincidence that he ended up quitting using alkaloids found in these plants (and others as well, brugmansia & jimson weed come to mind).  He was assisted by his plant allies.

Whenever one reads about "recreational (!?!)" use of these plants on erowid, the reports almost always end with uncontrolled bizarre behavior that usually calls the attention of authorities.  Dosing from the plant source is very unpredictable and overdosing seems common with trouble that follows.  These plants are used in indiginous shamanic settings as admixtures in ayahuasca or smoking mixtures.  I think the indiginous shamans have a better handle on how to use them than the average American drug user.

I was so impressed by S's success that when I needed a few days extra work each month I contacted the clinic.  Now S kids me about shooting 'Datura Darts'.  In this therapy the individual is screened medically (history and physical, ekg, pulmonary function tests) to make sure they are a safe candidate for the therapy.  They then receive injection therapy, with specific weight based doses of atropine and scopolamine, to provide anticholinergic effects on nicotine receptors.  Once processed through the clinic (they watch video's and receive behavioral counseling) they continue scopolamine and atropine orally for 2 weeks.

We discuss that these are not new medications and have been and are used in many different ways in medicine.

Patients routinely have a 'big experience' with the shots.... meaning the feel something..... ("ooooooooooooo this must be powerful medicine if it makes me feel this way")... I can't help but feel this has something to do with the effectiveness of the method.  I tell people what to expect from the shots...." you may feel dizzy or lightheaded and off balance; your pupils will dilate making lights bright and it difficult to focus (like coming out of the eye doctors); you will have a very dry mouth; it is most common for people to be sedated and fall asleep on the ride home; it is very common for people to describe feeling stoned, drunk or intoxicated.  Some people like it and some don't.  Often times people look drunk as they walk out of the clinic.

I have been doing this since march, 2 days a month, and am amazed at how many people stop smoking who have been unable to do so over a lifetime.  I do not have this years numbers yet (success rates from the clinics follow up) but feel it will be more than 50%.  People describe a loss of craving immediately.  This is a clinic situation who will take anyone who pays and passes the medical screening.  I don't think all these people are really ready to quit and I feel that is an important part of success.  With establishment of more clear screening guidelines I think it would be even more effective.

The effects are very predictable using the weight based dosing schedule.  I have not had any problems with psychotropic or other medical adverse reactions.  Yes, some people have some 'unusual' experiencI as they describe to me, but nothing untoward.  Older individuals (>60 y/o) also seem to tolerate the treatment.

I have spent six months connecting to the Datura's in my yard and spending time using plant material at very very low dose to try to further connect with the beneficial effects of Datura Darts.  I always comment to patients that these are not new medicine's and in fact the plants these chemicals come from were used as medicine long before there were doctors.

556 3350 193 sean 2007-10-02 15:43:31 This comment might meander...but then, no one is really obligated to read on, anyway. I feel that this situation will get worse and worse and worse until people wake up to the real issues, on both sides of the problem. I mean to say, until people realize the truth about Altered States and the truth about the Drug War...and I'm not putting any label on those "truths", simply saying that it is NOT where we're at now. Some people are making solid definitions that are based on morality, reasoning and experience (which is the apex of importance in this case, and so often the crux of misunderstanding...this brings forth my "favorite" adjunct to the Drug War: people who've never had any experience with Altered States, labeling the nature and the safety of these states...), but the overarching social trends and this "War on Drugs" we find ourselves within seems to be pretty mindless, fear based and engendered by controlling and manipulative individuals/organizations. I live in Canada, and like most Countries (I would assume all Countries which impose such Drug Laws wear this fa??ade...), my Government assumes to tell me that the Drug Laws they impose are STRICTLY for my safety. They have only my best interests in mind, and they wouldn't want me to expose myself to something potentially dangerous. That's very nice of them, you know? There are many daaaangerous things out there, and I just can't imagine what would happen if I were left to my own devices. If you'd like to believe that Fairy-Tale and accept that this is what they truly design when contemplating Drug Scheduling, then we're faced with a very serious inconsistency. It's so obvious that I'm sure we've all recognized it, but it's such a great example of the true intentions, and therefore the rhetorical and practical hypocrisy, behind Drug Scheduling and Governmental control of a Populations exposure to Altered States that I have to bring it up. If our safety is of the utmost import, why can I so readily walk to any Gas Station, Corner Store, Supermarket and any other variety of places, and buy a 25 pack of pre-rolled, chemically-treated Tobacco cigarettes? I know this is a really touchy subject, and I'm not talking about removing any persons "right" to buy a pack of cigarettes, or to access the plants and plant products (or chemical substances, or what-have-you, you know fill in the blank, haha) of their choice, I'm just talking about the skin-and-bones logic behind the fact that Tobacco, in it's current market offering of the "Machine Processed Cigarette" is legal and taxed, whereas MANY substances which have measurably lower toxicity and health risks (and when I say measurably, I really mean that this isn't even the same game we're playing...the sort of health risks associated with cigarettes are so direct and so Bodily...) are not only Scheduled, but sought out and destroyed, their advocates either forced into hiding their passion or paying for it by serving out time in Prison. So no matter what you want to say about the health risks of other plants and substances, there is this very obvious contradiction of Tobacco being so studied and well understood as being toxic and damaging yet still being legal...especially when you compare that sort of toxicity with some of the plants or substances which are Scheduled. 

Take Psilocybin mushrooms, for instance. By and large the toxicity of Psilocybin mushrooms, and certainly the toxicity of Psilocybin or Psilocin themselves, is really non-existent. What I mean is that the body load, the damage induced by processing the chemicals and the long term stress on your system (not to mention the LACK of Cancer causing agents...) is astronomically lower with Psilocybin mushrooms than with Tobacco. Yet if you were to endeavor, even once, to imbibe just a single Psilocybin mushroom, and even if you were filled with moral, reasonable or perhaps spiritual intention, and approached the situation with the utmost respect and openness for what the Altered State might present to you, you are invariably considered a criminal. The context is therefore not important, not whatsoever. I'm not saying this new Altered State (the example of the Psilocybin mushroom) is without dangers...what we have to admit is that everything has some potential for harm and once you acknowledge this, you invariably begin approaching things with respect. Isn't that healthier? Respect, not fear...just respect. Understanding how something might affect you, what you're opening yourself up to, and how you can go about it with the most caution and safety, if it is indeed something you must do at all...in my opinion, this attitude is miles away from one built on fear and out of habit, without personal knowledge but merely based on social pre-definition of these States and Substances. So, yes, Psilocybin surely would carry its own set of dangers, but in my strong yet hopefully humble opinion, when they are held up to the set of dangers which Tobacco (esp. in the Modern preparation) carries, the notion that these Schedules are "strictly for our safety" is truly laughable. Well, it would be if it weren't such a terrible reality, causing so much suffering. It's the most incredibly ironic situation, so much that it might be funny if it weren't so unbelievably awful and tragic. The ruling Western mentality is one dominated by the obsession with verifiable evidence, of Science (the narrow branch of scientific thought which both depends and insists on measurability and "empirical" evidence). Within this thought system, some great minds in many (especially, obviously, Medical) fields that take up this obsession with measuring datum and performing experiments and so forth give very convincing arguments that Tobacco, especially delivered in such a convenient, easy to inhale, and chemically-treated formula, is incredibly dangerous, and DOES increase the likelihood of Cancer and does degenerate your body and does cause an incredibly strong, physical, mental, and I would certainly argue social/cultural addiction. So...you know, it's all so mind baffling that I feel myself losing steam, just thinking about this. All that I can hold on to is that it's simply not possible that the Government is only looking out for my best interests. If that were true, hey, maybe they still wouldn't let me access some of the things I would like to be able to access safely and legally, and that's not good news, but IF it were true then we wouldn't see this inequity that we clearly (or at least I clearly) do see. I don't want Tobacco to be struck down, made illegal and removed from the hands of people. I want honesty, and I think that's all that we can hope for. This Drug War is nothing but suppression, we have yet to deal with the true nature and importance of Altered States in our Modern, "civilized" culture and we externalize our suppression of these issues by fighting against them physically...but that will never, ever make this go away. That's not where the problem is; it's not in the plants or the substances themselves. The problem is the attitudes that surround them, the contexts which they have been forced into by legislation, historical misconception (often judgments about other cultures integration of and focus upon Altered States have been made through Racist, Colonial, Superiority Complex based perspectives) and social propaganda which is as unflagging as the outward violent attempts at drug and populace control which we label "The Drug War". 

The way I often rationalize this situation is to look at our culture as a comprehensive Being, and therefore to envision the Drug War as an element or a consequence of that Being and it's actions and values. This helps me to fathom how we can attempt to understand the Drug War and what we're doing by enacting these cultural values (or perhaps simply allowing them to be enacted upon us, either way...). For one thing, we can then assume that this is not something frivolous. If the experience of Altered States were something frivolous, it would not have the sort of historical ties with Humanity and the type of broad social currency which it has and does, all across the World and throughout Time. So whether it's something good, bad, or neutral, it is not merely an inconsequential thing...we should be examining it seriously, no matter what our personal opinions. This war is not a serious examination, it is, as I said, a form of suppression. With the Being analogy of culture then this Drug War could actually be seen as a type of repression of Shadow Material. Instead of confronting Altered States we combat them, so we don't have to acknowledge them and start looking at the questions and complications that these states suggest. Therefore, like Shadow Material, the problem of Altered States will not disappear with repression, rather it will gain weight and ferocity in the depths of the it's dark exile, continually growing and becoming expressed with more violence and fear until it is finally acknowledged, and dealt with rationally and honestly. So, yes, it can get worse. It most likely will get worse...but the possibility is there that someday maybe enough people will open themselves up to searching for what is honest and truly felt rather than simply accepting what is, upon inspection, nothing but a maniacal suppression of an inevitable conflict.

The first was a bottle-rocket (or thrown explosive) that detonated right over my head while watching a small burn (not the man). Hot paper and packing scalded my cheek and I was almost deaf in my right ear for two days. The second was a signal flare that was fired into the air from a quarter mile away and came down on my friend and I as we strolled the Esplanade. I dove for cover, but my friend took a burning flare right in the chest, causing a nice big second-degree burn under his nipple. Yes, Burning Man can be dangerous.

The aggressively dangerous prank she refers to is playing loud music that wasn't trance or hippie drums (and turning it down when people asked us to).

Pinchbeck has about the same stratospheric odiousness level as GWB as far as I'm concerned, and I'm hoping to see some other name get out there as the go-to for mainstream reporters on the subject of psychedelics and especially ayahuasca.   Unfortunately, no one's as tied in to the mechanics of marketing oneself quite like he is.    Grrrr.

Ayahuasca does have a golden reputation in the press, but that is easy to ruin.  What has kept that reputation solid for the most part is how it's used now - in a circle, with at least a modicum of introspection, and usually someone with a decent amount of experience steering the boat.  I doubt there's anything intrinsic in the drug that's keeping the reputation so good (although I'm open to convincing on this).   

The question isn't "Will ayahuasca become mainstream", it's more "Can we keep cultures, individuals, and economics from getting trashed as it becomes more hip?" 0 24.62.239.164 1

I've thought about this a bit and have come to a couple of conclusions. First of all, the inclusion of harmine and harmaline in the brew makes the user sleepy and prone to lying down and having waking dreams instead of dancing all night and/or running naked out into traffic; it's more "gentle" and predictable which makes it more savory to academics and advocates. Secondly, the fact that it tastes like pig's bile and makes you puke like a fire-hose makes it fairly immune to recreational abuse, thus strengthening its "good medicine" mystique. Thirdly, because it has been adopted into traditional and syncretic religious ceremonies and the Supreme Court can't touch it, advocates love to fawn all over it as the most "spiritual" psychedelic, and we all know that in drug code "spiritual" = "good". And finally, no one has dosed on ayahuasca and jumped out of a window and/or accidentally murdered someone yet (though you all know it is probably coming one of these days). Until that day the brew gets a free ride from the press. 0 66.235.37.130 1

They didn't have to be a lot, and he didn't have to get them from the same doctor. I have occasional kidney stones, and the ER docs really push the oxy and hydro for that, so I always have a few half empty bottles lying around, put an anxiety disorder on top of that bam you've got the benzos, all legitimately prescribed by responsible doctors. Quit blaming the doctors and the pharm companies. Comon people, drugs don't take themselves. Geez. 0 206.81.65.155 1
1120 4178 117 magicbean 2008-02-09 15:01:14 I buy your first reason wholesale.   Folks ain't going far.   Or fast.

Second reason, meh...many recreational drugs have ghastly unpleasant side effects or dosing methods.   It's a subjective thing and trainable, what we'll put up with, no?  Puke or stick a needle in your arm, which is more unpleasant?

Third reason, I'll buy that too, with comment.   I see the free press pass for Ayahuasca as a good thing, because that free ride might hook other stuff along with it.  If A is acceptable, then its equivalent B, previously assumed to be completely unacceptable, might make progress back towards OK.   The longer it stays a press virgin, the better all around.   

The spiritual crowd also tends to be older, quieter, and less likely to post abominable videos of themselves on youtube.   They make idiots of themselves in private ways! 0 24.62.239.164 1

2234 4681 74 avicenna 2008-05-14 22:30:49 Zupakomputer: Funny, you should ask. Slate has a column called "The Green Lantern" which takes (generally totally inane) questions like "Is concentrated orange juice better for the environment than fresh squeezed?" and gives them genuinely interesting answers that all boil down to "Well, it depends..." Now, I'm not a fan of trying to reduce highly multidimensional ideas like "good for the environment" into a one dimensional scale with "good" on one end and "bad" on the other, so it's kind of a guilty pleasure read for me, but I like that it's honest enough to always say "Well, it depends..." Anyway, just especially for our little discussion, this week it takes on lawn maintenance. Here it is:

http://www.slate.com/id/2191200/

Now, it mostly compares regular lawn maintainence to artificial turf, but the basic ideas are there. Another thing to note is that in making these comparisons, it is really only meaningful to compare something to an alternative which is a reasonable substitute for the activity/product in question. Thus, the cocaine analysis compares it to coffee, which I gave them a little grief over whether it is comparable.

tomk, loco: Yes, there are exceptions, and my friend whom I quoted actually mentioned a few: organic beer and wine, sunlight grown organic pot, and a couple more. Shrooms were probably on the list. I doubt peyote was. But the real point is that unless you are growing your own, your drugs probably do have a non-neglible ecological footprint.

Bricoleur: I appreciate your concern for my psychological well being. Allow me to return the favor: Although I generally avoid this sort of diagnosis over the internet, I wonder whether you are projecting *your* emotional baggage about guilt and sin onto my quoting and referencing someone else's use of a fairly common English word.

It's weird if you do, cause it's like your life becomes anchored around taking meds, and then you have to eat at the exact same times every day too and plan your food eating like an hour before or after meds. 

But yeah, geez try eating proper food and not living or working in some un-natural shitty environment if you can, then you're way less likely to ever need any meds.

We would drink a bottle of robotussin, have a stomach ache for about 30 minutes and then go crazy for a few hours. One day I accidentally drank two bottles. I say accidentally because it started out as a sip out of the second bottle then another then a gulp until it was gone. After finishing that second bottle I realized I might have made a mistake. Then I proceeded to try and fit under the fridge. In all honesty it looked like the fridge was 3 feet off the ground. After telling everone "I COULD fit under the fridge I just don't have the energy right now" I flopped up the stairs. I went into my ex-girlfriends room and start yelling " Can someone please help that cat at the end of the bed. THere was no cat I was told the next day. Then the freaky stuff started. I don't remember much, but I was told I was shaking and talking giberish but looked like I was having the time of my life, so that is good. Of what I do remember there are many snapshots of the night. THe ceiling being pressed against my nose while laying in a bed 2 feet off the ground, and random flashes of color and motion. All in all I THINK I had fun. I met alot of new people as i found out the next couple of weeks. " Hey you where the guy trying to fit under the fridge" or " hey did you ever catch that cat" . 

Unfortunatlly you can not do this anymore. The Robotussen company has stopped making the extra strength cough formula, well they still make it but different ingredients. The DXM was removed from it. I believe you can still buy DXM legally off the internet but not sure on that. From what I understand the DXM pills are different from tru RoboTripping because you don't have those extra ingredients and sugar. Merry trips to all and to all a good trip. 0 208.51.153.226 1

879 30 trip456f3dac3639c www.physorg.com Marijuana may affect neuron firing The new-found effect of THC at hippocampal sites may point to underlying cause of marijuana's memory impairment U.S. scientists have discovered the active ingredient in marijuana interferes with synchronized activity between neurons in the hippocampus of rats.

The authors suggest action of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, might explain why marijuana impairs memory.

Gyorgy Buzsaki and colleagues at Rutgers University recorded the activity of multiple neurons in the hippocampus of rats. Normally neurons in that region form groups that fire action potentials, or nerve impulses, together at about 4-10 times per second. But when the authors injected THC, or a related synthetic drug, into the hippocampus, that synchrony was disrupted.

The researchers said the drugs did not change the total number of action potentials produced, just their tendency to occur at the same time. Animals with less synchronized neural activity under the drug performed less well in a standard test of memory, suggesting synchronized neural firing is important for normal hippocampal function.

The study appears in the December issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience. http://www.physorg.com/news84048508.html News Drugs 2 22 0 0 marijuana brain memory 0 1 tripzine 2006-11-30 14:23:08 30 0 www.tripzine.com 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 41 2010-05-05 15:28:34
878 30 trip456f3d22e578a media.www.dukechronicle.com Duke drug culture examined Interesting article taking an honest look at undergrad drug culture at Duke University Before Mike came to Duke, he was a typical high-achieving student.

Like many of his high school classmates, he drank on occasion but had tried little else.

By his sophomore year at Duke, Mike had experimented with cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, Viagra and Cialis. And he was smoking marijuana nearly every day.

"We tried to make each night as fun as possible," said Mike, reflecting on the behavior of his friends from freshman and sophomore year.

Now a junior, Mike said that, in retrospect, the lifestyle took a toll on their academics. http://media.www.dukechronicle.com/media/storage/paper884/news/2006/11/30/News/Highs.Lows.Mark.Duke.Drug.Culture-2515082.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dukechronicle.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com News Drugs 2 22 0 0 Duke drugs marijuana 0 1 tripzine 2006-11-30 14:20:50 30 0 www.tripzine.com 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 43 2010-01-20 11:58:36

Utah Lawmaker Paul Ray watched our story on Salvia divinorum. He didn't like what he saw.

"I am rocking the world right now. I just feel like I am rocking the world."

Only KSL brought you the video of kids tripping out on the legal herb, Salvia -- a substance narcotics officers compare to LSD.

"Like I've stepped outside my body."

We went undercover to show you how easy it is to buy the hallucinogen at Salt Lake Valley smoke shops. Our story revealed that while Utah teens know all about smoking Salvia to get high, parents are in the dark.

"Never knew anything about this. Never heard of this."

Rep. Paul Ray, (R) Clearfield: "It was upsetting to see we have a drug of that strength that's legal."

Moments after our story ended, Utah Representative Paul Ray began writing a bill to ban Salvia. We were there on Capitol Hill to see the paperwork filed.

Rep. Paul Ray, (R) Clearfield: "We're basically going to make it illegal to possess or sell. Period."

Late today we learned one local police department is also reacting to our story. They've decided now is the right time to educate officers about the herb, emailing out information and photos of Salvia. http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=682728 News Drugs 2 22 0 0 salvia hallucinogen herb 0 1 tripzine 2006-11-29 11:55:26 30 0 www.tripzine.com 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 65 2010-04-06 14:32:35

75 30 traffic 01.30.01 Traffic Steven Soderbergh 's latest film is heavy on style and chock full of anti drug-war propaganda, but does it deliver the dope? Christopher Dale <font color=ff0000><b>YOU MAY HAVE HEARD</b></font> about this movie 'Traffic', a gritty real-life portrayal of life on the front lines of the drug war, directed artfully by Steven Soderbergh and crammed end to end with major Hollywood stars. Sure you've heard about it, maybe you've even seen it by now. It's up for a few awards. It's full of anti drug-war propaganda. It's being labeled as a 'classic' and Soderbergh is now a 'genius'. But is the movie really all that good?

I went into Traffic with high expectations and must say that it was quite good for a movie churned out of the Hollywood system. Soderbergh's film-school tricks for adding hues or extra exposure to scenes depending on their mood and location embedded a layer of depth and tension into the narrative and gave the whole film a by-the-hip indie feel you'd expect from a younger director. And the way the varying levels of storytelling intersected silently with each other in random locations throughout the film gives the viewer a heightened sense of thoughtfulness from the director that you wouldn't expect from a typical cut-and-paste action thriller.

Yes, it is a good movie. Even the actors are good in it, and the two prep-school baseheads played by Erika Christensen and Topher Grace (That '70s Show) are especially interesting. But where Traffic ultimatly piles up is in the screenplay itself. The story is good and the message is clear ("The Drug War is futile at best, deadly at worst"), but the way in which the story plays out left me feeling a bit cheated, once again lied to by the slick merchandising machine that is Hollywood.

If you have not seen the movie and hate spoilers you can stop reading here and skip ahead to the last paragraph. I am about to divulge a few problems I had with the end of the film. First off, the realism of the movie flew completely out the window as conservative Drug-Czar to be Robert Wakefield (played effortlessly by Michael Douglas) caves in on his acceptance speech and has a tender change of heart about his hard-line Drug War beliefs in front of the American public. He then races to support his crack-addicted daughter through treatment and recovery and we are led to believe that through his courage and a little lip-service at narc-anon that everything will be alright. Up until this point the movie was fairly unflinching in its attempt at realism, even convincing, but the over-the-top Oliver Stone-ing of message coupled with the 'coming-up-roses' ending made me feel sold. For all the plot complexity, in the end the message was as crisp and heavy-handed as an after-school special.

Despite all that, I wouldn't recommend that you just say 'No' to Traffic. Even though it's only about blow I would say it's worth seeing, but do keep a critical eye on the message vs. what actually happens in the movie. The contradictions in this film are as earnest and illogical as America's own love/hate relationship with drugs, and maybe that's the movie's whole point. Either way, it is still a good movie by Hollywood standards.

It comes in a plastic disc, about the size of a half dollar, filled with a dried herb called Purple Sticky Salvia.

The package says its incense - but teens say that's just a smoke-screen.

76 30 downey 01.30.01 Poster Boy Choosing who or what goes on the cover of a magazine is one of the most important decisions a publisher can make. Take a look at some of the issues we deal with. James Kent <font color=ff0000><b>SO I WAS THINKING</b></font> about relaunching this magazine I publish, TRP: The Resonance Project, but there was a problem with it. The name was too long. People kept mispronouncing 'resonance', or pronouncing it right but confusing us with another fine Seattle periodical called 'Resonance' that covers the dance music scene. It was a pain. The name was meant to convey a complex metaphysical idea within a handy three letter acronym, but some people just weren't getting it. Some understood, a few even cheered the concept of a 'Resonance Project', but everyone else just called it TRP, or Trip.

Yes, <i>trip</i> is a much shorter meme with less baggage and more action. It is nowhere near as academic or arcane as TRP, but it is freer and, dare we say, a bit hipper. It will infiltrate the mind faster, stick longer, and go farther. It is borne into motion and built to travel. That is what it is, a <i>trip</i>, a journey through space and time where every tiny detail is as important as the big picture. 

Once we had decided on the name change I began ruminating about what to put on the cover of the first issue. Choosing who or what goes on the cover of a magazine is one of the most important decisions a publisher can make. A cover not only defines who and what you are, but it also dictates where your magazine will be placed on the racks even moreso than actual content. For example, a magazine with Brad Pitt or Madonna on the cover will get front-row placement next to 'Vogue' or 'GQ' even if the magazine is about organic gardening. It is what publishers with fringe markets do to branch out to the mainstream and attract new readers. It is called marketing. 

Which brings us to poor Robert Downey Jr. (or RDJ as we like to call him around here). RDJ is in an interesting position right now because he represents the grand paradox of American drug culture. Here is one of our generation's best and brightest, a celebrated actor of exceeding wit and charm, and a purebred product of the Hollywood drug culture. He would be indistinguishable from any one of a dozen of his peers except for one thing: he got himself in trouble. Now he is more famous than all of them, just won a Golden Globe for 'Ally McBeal', and could go back to jail for doing even more drugs! What could be more interesting than <i>that</i>? Let's put him on the cover! Our distributors will love us!

Cashing in on the tragedy of celebrity is nothing new for magazines -- in fact it may be the reason magazines were invented -- but we've never really done it before. Having a celebrity on the cover would definitely mean better placement on the stands, higher sales, more money, and more unsuspecting members of the mainstream being accidently exposed to our supremely radical vision, so the decision seemed obvious. We will sell out. We will put RDJ on the cover. We will rationalize it all on payday.

But then we thought about it for a few days and started to feel icky. The questions started to gnaw at us. Is RDJ really the kind of role model we want for our magazine? Will putting him on the cover glorify his self-destructive behavior? Will our subscribers be offended by this brazen move towards the mainstream? And, most of all, will RDJ even return our phone calls? These are the things we think about, the spiritual politics of playing in the big media circus. Do we step into the mainstream like we're in charge or keep our heads down and walk safely and quietly through the subculture. 

In the end we decided the RDJ cover was more of a spoof then a real cover. We chose instead a spectacular image from an underground artist named Morpheus. It probably won't warrant placement next to 'Details' or 'Spin', but it will find a nice spot in the alternative section and probably deserves more exposure than RDJ anyway. And though I hate to use the term "keepin' it real" when I'm not all pimped-out in my black velvet Nike track suit, that is essentially what we are doing here. We changed the name but we heven't changed the game. That RDJ shit, we was just frontin' on that, for real.

79 30 sirius from TRP 5 An Interview with RU Sirius A look inside the mind of Mondo's errant editor and the man who might have been president Malvolio Rutteledge <b>MR: In "Revolution #5" on Disinfo.com, you wrote, "The truth can now be told... the United States is a police state..." How far ranging do you think the drug war has become in orchestrating the bulk of current U.S. troubles? Do you feel that the suppression of cannabis and other entheogens is really the major political lynchpin that libertarians such as Dick Cowan would have us believe? We're talking vested interests here...</b>

RU: I consider the drug war to be a bigger disaster for America than the war in Viet Nam. In terms of the destruction of our civil liberties, the evolution of a prison/industrial complex, some five and a half million people in prisons... so that now there's a vested economic interest in incarcerating people, the majority of them for drugs... the McCarthyism of ubiquitous drug testing, the seizure of property without trial or conviction, just on and on. The question I have is where are our Berrigan brothers? Where's our Doctor Spock? Where are the religious persons of conscience spilling blood on files in the DEA offices? They've got something like 30% of young black males now in the criminal punishment system, the US is being denounced by Amnesty International because the prisons themselves are torture chambers. Where's the peace movement? 

<b>Why are prisons and entertainment the only growing U.S. industry?</b>

Well, we're the first post-industrial state. Leisure, play, amusement, those are the would-be industries of the future. Prison is a kind of enforced leisure I guess, in a weird sort of way.

<b>You wrote that most Americans find the current totalitarian state passable as long as they are not directly involved with it. Just how totalitarian IS the United States? </b>

Well, you don't see any great uprising do you? I mean, they're searching our urine! On a certain highway outside of Austin, Texas, on random days, they just pull everybody over and search their cars for drugs. You're supposed to be able to refuse to have your car searched without reasonable cause, but the Texas judiciary in its wisdom has figured out that refusing IS reasonable cause. There's an institutionalized Catch 22 right there in Texas but don't ask don't tell anyone.

<b>Professor David Marc wrote in "The Bonfire of the Humanities" that the current drug prohibition is aimed at the lower class and the middle class because the government "doesn't want people too stoned to go to work." Do you agree? </b>

I think it's one element of a confluence of reasons. The illegality of drugs is a huge industry. I'm sure when Nixon escalated it into a war, it was at least partly about budgets... who gets to have a project and get a bunch of money. The DEA... the various arms of law enforcement and the justice system involved in that particular area. And then there was just the cultural hostility towards the underclass, towards blacks and, particularly in its origins in 1968, against hippies and the "new left." Finally, there's the black budget profits that are gained by keeping the pleasure drug industry in the shadows.

<b>I often look at photos of the drug czar and wonder what is in that guy's head. What is in that guy's head? He obviously believes in state obscurantism... </b>

He doesn't look much like a Czar, does he? What's the story with General Barry McCaffrey? He seems smart and yet he says such dumb things. Does he know any better? We know Bill and Al know better. It was probably politically expedient for them to choose somebody who was totally clueless when it came to drugs.

<b>What role do you see sociobiology playing in future organization of society? Edward O. Wilson's work at one point was regarded (and possibly still is) as quite heretical in that it posited an almost completely deterministic conception of the human species. It's interesting how this could tie in with Huxley's satire on society, Brave New World.</b>

I've just been re-reading Edward O. Wilson's On Human Nature and it strikes me as much more poetic, humane and sympathetic the second time through. I find it amusing that some humanists are offended by the notion that there's any connection whatsoever between human societal organization and behavior and animal societal organization and behavior. Talk about human chauvinism. It's weird when you talk to people whose opinions on science and the nature of things is dictated by political comfort, so that exploring the biological roots of behavior becomes verboten. That's weird. Don't even look over here. Don't think about this. Umm... Animal Farm, yes.

<b>How do you feel about voting? </b>

Nauseous. Actually, I want people to vote for me. I've started the new political party, The Revolution, and I'm our candidate for President! Just say R.U. Sirius, the only response to the other candidates. In all seriousness, I think if we non-authoritarians voted, we could form a power block that would provide a countervailing influence to the right wing moralists and also help to break the Republicrat two-party hold on the political process.

<b>Can you define the political platform of your Revolution party? </b>

I would define it as 21st Century Humanist Libertarianism, or damned near something like that. 

<b>If you were elected president today, what would your first domestic and foreign policy decisions be? </b>

My first domestic policy decision after ordering up pizza would be to pardon all federal prisoners in for non-violent drug possession charges and all prisoners listed with Amnesty International. My second move would be to stop providing all the arms to pretty much everybody globally... 

<b>In your opinion are there any grey areas at all between anarchy and authoritarinism, and if there are how can we ever hope to acheive a happy medium? </b>

Absolutely. I'm not an anarchist in any absolutist sense. I think the Jeffersonian tradition as reflected in the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights is plenty anti-authoritarian. We've never lived up to those principles. 

<b>What do you think is the most dangerous thing about the Internet? </b>

Ubiquitous decentralized media more or less destroys social consensus, destroys consensus reality, by dispersing attention. This is on the one hand desirable, but it's also problematic. You can't bring people together too easily, for instance, to make social change. 

<b>Do you think WebTV will catch on? It has been claimed that it could revolutionize the world. For example, in China, where the state controls most media, if all you need is a TV and a keyboard you could access the Internet. Still, one does not hear much about WebTV. Predictions?</b>

Eventually, there will be a medium that will allow individuals to upload video, both tape and live, so that individuals will be able to broadcast materials at the same level of quality that we're accustomed to. Will it revolutionize the world? I think in some sense, the utter decentralization of public media and public discourse devolutionizes the world, but in an interesting way. We can no longer locate a consensus reality to subvert. The only thing that would revolutionize the world would be production technologies that overwhelm scarcity. The first step toward that is anything that will end our reliance on oil. I'd say we have a few years &#151; less than a decade &#151; to make a complete transition from oil usage &#151; if we're lucky. Probably, it's already too late.

<b>After spending the early 90s at Mondo &#151; ground-zero of the whole cyber-psychedelic rave-culture explosion &#151; what do you think of the shape of that particular scene today? What do you think the next big wave of countercultural revolution will look like? </b>

The commercial rave scene has spread psychedelic experimentation and thinking among youths like nothing since the hippie culture in the sixties, but I'm not personally interested. Smaller private rave gatherings are still pretty nice. It's almost become the assumption that an opening for a new hip magazine, or even a sugar saturated beverage trying to appear hip, will have a rave party for their opening. It's ubiquitous. I don't think we can talk in terms of counterculture anymore because the consensus reality that counter would be counter to is so confused and dispersed. I think we'll see more and more subculture. But I also think that people who like to mind their own business will get political for obvious reasons of self-protection... 

<b>What was your overall experience as editor for Mondo? Seemed like a cool position to be in.</b>

Mondo was the biggest fun of my life. When it was in its groove for a couple of years, it was a pleasure to be part of it. There weren't really any office rules, and yet we made it work. I could smoke DMT in the living room on a work day, if the moment seemed right. I haven't been able to find another job like that!

<b>What do you think of Wired magazine? It seems like a giant hoax to me. Like George. A yes-man club of a few yuppie technophiles. What are your favorite magazines? Do you like Hustler?</b>

Wired was interesting early on, when it explored some topics in depth. But Wired was a safe corporate clone of Mondo 2000, and the current Wired is an even safer corporate clone of itself. The early Wired was, at least, an authentic project of genuine technophiles. The current Wired is being done by professional journalists, people with no connection to technoculture &#151; people of no vision who laughed at the notion of cyberculture before it became mainstream. I like Pop Smear, a very hip and funny sort of tabloidesque semi-pornographic zine out of New York City. And I like Mean, which is a very well-written sort of subculture/pop zine. Hustler doesn't really have much in terms of interesting content, although I like pornography in general. I prefer Club International as far as straightforward semi-gynecological photos of distortedly silicone-based hyper-sexualized young women are concerned. I liked 21.c, a technoculture zine out of Australia that straddled the line between academic and pop, but now that's gone. 

<b>What authors are you currently reading? Why?</b>

I'm finally reading Neal Stephenson's latest book. I read a chapter from it that was published in Time and thought it was great. I've been recently devouring whatever Bruce Sterling novels I hadn't already read. I think his most recent work, Distraction, is amazing. And I'm reading this book called BOGGS: A Comedy of Values, by Lawrence Weschler. It's about this artist who paints money and trades the paintings at the value he puts on the money for goods and services. In other words, if he paints a $50 bill he convinces someone to take it in trade for $50 worth of whatever...

<b>Do you like Ketamine? </b>

I like Ketamine mostly because it doesn't last very long. If someone would come up with an LSD or a psilocybin where you could peak in a few minutes and be completely done in an hour-and-a-half, that would be just as good. But Ketamine, I think, gets you to your core address. It gives you the perspective of distance, but with a weird technological edge.

<b>In "The Scientist", Lilly had a vision on Ketamine where he went into the future and saw all the cars running on water vapor. I saw a week ago in the news that Chrystler-Daimler-Benz revealed a car that does just that and will be available for purchase in 2004... </b>

I definitely believe that scientific and technological solutions present themselves in psychedelic experiences. 

<b>What kind of new technology have you been using or like?</b>

I'm not that much of a user of technology. Like William Gibson, I follow technology and its cultural significance. I leave the hacking to others. I like the whole MP3 thing though. I really want there to be a global jukebox attached to some kind of machine. I put in my credit card or my ATM card and for say $1 I can hear any album that was ever recorded. Once I've picked that album say 15 times, I own it and can listen to it any time I want. 

<b>A friend of mine bitterly claims that the TV he watched as a child created archetypes in his mind that will never go away. Do you think that's true? I mean, there is the use-it-or-lose-it law of mental processing, right?</b>

Ward, I think it's time to have a few words with the Beaver. He sounds like he's on drugs or something.

<b>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? </b>

Sure I'll have custard... Interviews Drugs 3 22 53 0 psychedelic 1 2 Drugs tripzine 2001-04-23 00:00:00 2005-12-21 21:34:56 tripzine 1 www.tripzine.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 5 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 http://chrysler.websitewelcome.com/~tripzine/images/sirius.jpg 0.00 0.00 0 81 2010-05-07 13:09:33
80 30 vine from TRP 1 Vine of the Souls A Closer Look at Amozonia's Visionary Medicine Charlie Kidder <font color=ff0000><b>DEEP IN THE HEART</b></font> of the Amazonian rainforest grows a sacred vine known for its magical powers. This vine is known by many names, but the most well known of them all may be ayahuasca (aye-yah-wah-skah). In the Quechua language, aya means spirit or ancestor, and huasca means vine or rope. It is reputed that those who consume this vine of the souls are bestowed with the ability to commune with spirits, diagnose illness, treat disease, and even predict the future. While the existence of this vine is certainly no big secret, it is only recently that western science has decided to study the magical properties of this sacred medicine. 

Archaeological evidence may date ayahuasca use in Ecuador back five millennia. However, western knowledge of ayahuasca dates back only as far as 1851 when a group of Tukanoan Indians invited British botanist and explorer Richard Spruce to participate in a ceremony which included a visionary drink they called caapi. Spruce only drank a small amount of the "nauseous beverage," but he couldn't help noticing the profound effect it had on his new friends. The Tukanoans showed Spruce the plant from which the caapi was made, and he was able to collect good specimens of the plant in full flower. Spruce named the plant Banisteria caapi, and further research led him to conclude that caapi, yage, and ayahuasca were all Indian names for the same potion made using this one vine. 

Since these early findings, indigenous use of various ayahuasca potions has been reported throughout the Amazon as far east as the R'o Negro in Brazil and as far west as the Pacific coastal areas of Colombia and Ecuador. It is also found as far north as the Panama coast, and southward into areas of Amazonian Perœ and Bolivia. At least 72 indigenous groups have been found to use similar preparations known by a total of over forty different names. 

<b>Preparation</b>

Ayahuasca potions are normally prepared by soaking or steeping lianas of Banisteriopsis caapi or related species for various lengths of time. The specific method varies from group to group, but the simplest method is a cold water infusion where pieces of the stem are first pounded and allowed to stand in cold water, after which the plant material is strained off and the remaining potion drunk. Some groups will immerse the pounded stems in hot water, cooking the plant material anywhere from an hour to all day long. The longest of these preparation methods involves repeated boiling and filtering of the plant matter and extract until only a thick concentrate remains. This process normally comprises a whole day's work, taking up to fifteen hours to prepare a single batch. 

Banisteriopsis caapi is often the only plant used to make ayahuasca. However, it is not an uncommon practice to add one or more admixture plants to the brew during its preparation. Admixture plants help to flavor the experience of each specific batch of ayahuasca, and often contain stimulants or visionary compounds, like caffeine, nicotine, or DMT. In ayahuasca potions made using DMT-containing additives, it is most likely that DMT is the key visionary ingredient, responsible for most if not all of the potion's powerful entheogenic effects. 

<b>Pharmacology of Ayahuasca </b>

DMT was first synthesized in 1931, fifteen years before it was discovered to be a naturally occuring compound. DMT is found in many psychoactive Amazonian snuffs prepared from the resin of numerous species of Virola trees, and was first naturally extracted from a shamanic snuff made from the crushed seeds and pods of Anadenanthera peregrina in 1955. In 1956, Stephen I. Szara and colleagues became the first to experience the effects of the hydrochloride salt of N,N-Dimethyltryptamine via intramuscular injection at doses ranging from 0.7 to 1.1 mg per kg body weight. He found the drug to produce what he described as a "psychotic effect partially similar to that caused by mescaline or LSD-25." Szara found that after injecting 50 to 60 mg of DMT, entheogenic effects commenced within two to three minutes, lasting about 45 minutes to an hour. He described the effects thus: "Eidetic phenomena, optical illusions, pseudo-hallucinations and later real hallucinations, appeared. The hallucinations consisted of moving, brilliantly colored oriental motifs, and later I saw wonderful scenes altering very rapidly. The faces of the people seemed to be masks. My emotional state was elevated sometimes up to euphoria..." 

By 1977, it was established that smoking DMT free base produces a more potent and rapid effect than does injection. Thirty mg of DMT smoked was found to produce almost instant peak effects, lasting a total of only five to ten minutes. However, DMT has been tested in doses of up to an entire gram ingested orally without producing any effects whatsoever. So the question remained: Since DMT appears to be completely inactive orally, how can the average 29 mg found in an orally ingested dose of ayahuasca produce a visionary effect? 

The answer to this question lies in the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). This enzyme normally functions in our digestive systems to break down any monoamines present within the foods we eat so that they do not upset the balances of monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism going on in our brains. DMT, being a monoamine, is completely oxidized and decomposed by MAO in the gut when it is ingested orally. However, the §-carboline alkaloids from the Banisteriopsis liana are know to inhibit MAO to the point where the accompanying DMT from the admixture plant can survive in the digestive tract and make its way to the brain. 

The structure of DMT (as well as those of other entheogenic compounds) is remarkably close to that of the important modulatory neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT). Such neurotransmitter shuffling is thought to bring about the disinhibition of normally controlled and regulated processes within the brain. The binding of serotonin-like molecules to the 5-HT receptors affects serotonergic neurons which can stimulate a wide range of things - from repressed emotions and memories to the brain's image-processing system. This unique combination of neural stimuli results in a wondrous explosion of transcendent emotion and internal kaleidoscopic imagery. 

<b>Shamanic Use of Ayahuasca </b>

The mestizo shamans of the Peruvian Amazon generally refer to themselves as vegetalistas. These plant-doctors help the people of rural areas and the urban poor who often have no other available help in critical situations requiring medical attention. Most vegetalistas tend to specialize, using just one or few plant teachers in their practices. Thus there are tabaqueros who use tobacco; toeros who use various Brugmansia species; catahueros who use the resin of catahua (Hura crepitans); paleros who use the bark of various large trees; perfumeros who use the scents of various fragrant plants; and ayahuasqueros who use ayahuasca. 

The shamanic use of ayahuasca is usually within the context of healing. The shaman or ayahuasquero takes ayahuasca to better diagnose the nature of the patient's illness. Vegetalistas claim they receive their healing skills from certain plant teachers, who are believed to have a madre or spirit-mother. The role of the shaman is to mediate the transmission of medicinal knowledge from the plant teacher to the human world for use in curing. 

The plant teachers are believed to teach the neophyte shaman a number of power songs or supernatural melodies called icaros, either during an ayahuasca session or in dreams following the ingestion of other plant teachers. The plant teachers give the magical songs to the vegetalista so that he or she may sing or whistle them during healing sessions. Some shamans place so much emphasis on the healing power of the icaros that once he or she has learned a good number of them, the ayahuasca is no longer necessary for healing. 

Artist and Peruvian vegetalista Pablo Amaringo has painted a series of his past ayahuasca visions, depicting them in great detail. In order to do this, Amaringo will attempt to recall one of his visions, sometimes by singing the icaro he sang at the time of the vision. This brings back the image so vividly that Amaringo is able to project it onto a canvas and then simply trace it adding colors later. Images from ayahuasca visions are a predominate feature of Amazonian art. It has been suggested that this visual art along with the melodies of the icaros combine with the synaesthetic effects of the potion to produce an "aesthetic frame of mind" central to the healing process. The design the shaman paints onto his or her body is believed to represent a healthy energy pattern, and is often revealed by the ayahuasca. 

When a person becomes sick, their energy pattern becomes distorted. Under the influence of ayahuasca, the shaman can see the distortion in the patient's energy pattern and attempt to restore a healthy pattern using suction, massage, medicinal plants, hydrotherapy, and restoration of the patient's soul. The similarities between these shamanic methods and techniques used in traditional Chinese chi-gong, or "energy directed" medicine, should be noted. Interestingly, a shaman usually chooses medicinal plants based on visible characteristics, like shape or color. For example, a plant which produces flowers shaped like an ear may be used to treat ear diseases. Part of the novice shaman's training involves scrutinizing nature to learn about the properties or "hidden virtues" within the surrounding plants and animals. 

<b>Modern Interest in Ayahuasca </b>

From the first written mention of ayahuasca by a Jesuit priest near the end of the 17th century to current research dealing with ayahuasca, our knowledge of this ancient Amazonian ethnomedicine has grown considerably. In just the last few decades, a fair number of publications have been written on the topic; anthropologists have begun studying how ayahuasca is used to heal; and research groups have started studying the potion's long-term physiological and psychological effects. Another interesting modern phenomenon is the growing number of Christian churches throughout South America who have opted for ayahuasca as their sacrament during communion instead of the usual symbolic bread and wine sacraments. These churches claim that the potion helps to promote intense concentration and direct contact with the spiritual plane. 

The first of these ayahuasca churches were initially formed in the 1920s in Brazil, and today two groups, the Uni‹o de Vegetal (UDV or 'Herbal Union') and the Santo Daime [see related article], continue to flourish. These neo-Christian churches now mainly exist in urban areas, and represent the modern movement of ritual ayahuasca use from the primal rainforest into the big city. 

In these churches mass is held once a week. The church members cultivate the plants needed to make the potion, and oversee its preparation and storage. On special occasions, ayahuasca is dispensed in small cups at communion. The dose is only a couple of ounces, but the ayahuasca they produce has been reported to be very strong. As the celebration usually lasts all night long, it is not unusual for members of the church to take several doses during the course of the evening. 

In 1985, the Brazilian government added the ayahuasca liana to its list of controlled substances. The UDV soon petitioned the ban and the Brazilian government appointed a commission to investigate the issue. The commission found no evidence of social disruption associated with the sacramental use of ayahuasca (which the commission members tried themselves) and ayahuasca was removed from the Brazilian controlled substances list in August of 1987. More problems arose in 1988 when an anonymous source alleged that the churches consisted of fanatics, drug addicts, and ex-guerrillas given to smoking Cannabis and taking LSD during their rites. Yet another study of the issue was ordered by the government, this time to investigate the physiological aspects of ayahuasca's pharmacology. The conclusions of this study prompted the Brazilian government in June of 1992 to exempt Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis - as well as the ayahuasca potion - from its illicit substances list. This legal decision has opened the doors to the further expansion of these churches, which have since held ceremonies in several cities all over the world. An international scientific research team, the Hoasca Project, has recently begun studying the long term effects, both psychological and physiological, of chronic ayahuasca use by these church members. 

<b>Ayahuasca and the Future </b>

It is hard to say what the future may hold for ayahuasca. It could prove to be a useful tool in helping science better understand the biochemistry of consciousness and the genetics of pathological brain function. Pharmaceutical MAO-inhibitors are widely used in western medicine as anti-depressants, and further research into the psychotherapeutic benefits gained from the tryptamines remains to be done. 

As far as religion is concerned, the potential for expansion of ayahuasca-using churches seems unlimited. Incorporation of a powerful psychoactive sacrament into religious ceremonies could have far-reaching effects on modern spiritual practices and beliefs. However, it remains to be seen whether entheogen users here in the U.S. would be attracted to the idea of psychedelic Christianity. 

All in all, ayahuasca represents a unique plant-based medicine. The fact that its traditional use by Amazonian Indians has survived the continual influence of Western acculturation is testimony to the central and important role it has in their world-view. In fact, in many Amazonian tribes the first thing the parents will give a newborn baby is a drop of ayahuasca - right in the mouth. To them it is the supreme medicine, and a true gift from the gods.

176 30 ed4 TRP 4 So Where the Hell is Hyperspace? Everyone's talking about it, but how do we get there? James Kent Hyperspace - 1.) An accelerated or excited space. 2.) Any dimension above and beyond 3-D spacetime (commonly referred to as "reality"). So when looking for hyperspace, we would be searching for any space or dimension that exists above and beyond the reality we normally perceive. Many scholars, mathematicians, and mystics have spent many lifetimes attempting to discover exactly what and where hyperspace actually is, but the main problem of hyperspace is that you can't actually see it. You can't even poke at it. No matter how fervently or convincingly you argue or attempt to prove its existence, you can never really know if it's actually there.

Okay, so maybe that's hyperbole.

The truth is, if we had enough energy (and I'm talking about a lot of energy) we could conceivably open some kind of vortex to hyperspace. However, even if we had the energy of 100 suns to dedicate to this project, all we would get is a shaky, unstable, minuscule singularity barely the width of a photon. What would we do with that? Anything that went in would probably never come out, and the area around the singularity would bend and warp and cause all kinds of messy temporal and spacial distortions. Nope, unless our current sources of generating energy improve dramatically hyperspace will remain out of our physical reach. And because our senses are wired to perceive such a narrow spectrum of reality, it would seem we are forever banished to exist solely in the hard cold world of 3-D spacetime. 

However, what if there were a way to experientially reproduce the phenomenon of existing in higher dimensional states? What if instead of bending space itself we could somehow bend the perceptual boundaries that limit our view of reality? What if there was some switch we could throw to blow open our default data-gathering settings so we could start receiving information on broadband instead of narrow-spectrum? Would you want to throw that switch? Would you want to take a look into hyperspace?

Of course you would. Who wouldn't?

There are only two good reasons I can think of why somebody would shy away from the experience of having their perceptual veils lifted. The first is that they are scared of what they might find. The mere thought of having one's ontology shattered into a million pieces at the flip of the switch can be somewhat jarring, no doubt. The second reason I can think of for refusing the experience is that it may be considered a cultural taboo. Either of these cases on its own would be good enough reason to avoid such things, but when the two forces are combined &#151; ontological uneasiness and social pressures &#151; they spell outright fear.

So what's so scary about hyperspace? Does it pose some kind of threat to our way of life? Is it the mythical boundary between life and death? Does it cross that thin line between reality and fantasy land, sanity and insanity? Does it hold secrets that mere mortals were never meant to behold? Whatever it is, it is a force to be reckoned with, and not to be stepped into lightly.

Of the many ways people have attempted to grok hyperspace over the last few millennia, possibly the most interesting and controversial method has been the ingestion of DMT. DMT is not just another psychedelic drug to be studied and cataloged. No, it may very well be the Holy Grail to hyperspace so many have been looking for. Neurochemically speaking, DMT is like a synaptic skeleton key to hyper-consciousness. It is similar in structure to serotonin and other common neurotransmitters, and it fits in very nicely at most major receptor sites. When the neural matrix is suddenly flooded with this sublime substance, it is akin to having all of your neural switches instantaneously flipped on all at once. The effects are so dramatic that they are overwhelming, and some might even say astonishing. 

When I tried DMT for the first time, it's true I was a bit startled. I was not expecting the substance of what I saw to be so real. I had the exhilarating feeling that I was fully awake for possibly the first time in my life. My eyes and ears were opened to a dimension of vision and sound that I could never have imagined existed. It was not just hallucination or simple perceptual distortion &#151; that would have been easy to cope with. What I experienced was more like perceptual amplification and magnification, a full awakening of the senses. I could suddenly see jeweled detail and temporal depth in everything I looked at. Objects no longer held the illusion of solidity, but revealed themselves as distinct vibrational fields in constant transition through time. It was a life-changing experience, and one that has led me to remark that DMT may be "the single most exquisite substance on the entire planet."

What do I mean by that? Well, for starters, I never really comprehended just how complex and mysterious reality was until I first smoked DMT. I had received vague inklings of cosmic depth and quick glimpses into hidden forces via other transcendent experiences in my lifetime, but never had I witnessed the intricate processes which hold reality together on such a visceral level. Sub atomic, molecular, genetic, electromagnetic, and cosmic forces all became explicit before my eyes. These were no longer abstract concepts, but actual processes unfolding in real-time before my eyes. It was &#151; how shall I say &#151; heavy.

So with that heaviness in mind, let us step into the world of DMT and the bizarre hyperspace it evokes. These pages contain a multitude of new insights and new information into the understanding of this awe-inspiring chemical from some of today's most noted scholars. We may think that we are a fairly advanced civilization, but we are only now beginning to peel away at the thin layers of our reality. I doubt anyone is fully ready for what we will find, but I have no doubt that DMT is one of the keys to breaking through this barrier. The voyage has only but begun.

179 30 salvia_au 5.31.2002 Salvia Divinorum Outlawed in Australia An Update from the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics Made possible by
the <a href="http://www.alchemind.org/salvia_defense_fund.htm" target="new">Salvia Divinorum Defense Fund</a> 

 

Effective June 1, Australia becomes the first country to make the plant Salvia divinorum a prohibited drug. Pursuant to a ruling by Australia's National Drugs And Poisons Schedule Committee (NDPSC), both Salvia divinorum and its active principle salvinorin A, will be added to Schedule 9 of Australia's Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons (SUSDP). Australia's action raises fears that other governments may soon follow suit.

 

Schedule 9 is Australia's most restrictive drug schedule, and includes "substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities."

 

Under Australian law, drug control is a state rather than a federal issue. Thus the NDPSC's decision is technically only a recommendation to Australia's states and territories to prohibit both S. divinorum and salvinorin A. It is practically unheard of, however, for states to deviate from the NDPSC's rulings. Accordingly it is a fait accompli that the possession, distribution, or cultivation of S. divinorum and salvinorin A will now be considered a criminal offense in all of Australia.

 

The Alchemind Society's Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics has been in contact with a group of scientific researchers in Australia who are working to challenge the NDPSC's ruling and block its adoption by the various states and territories. So far these efforts have been unsuccessful.

 

Australia's scheduling of S. divinorum raises concerns that the US DEA, which is known to be evaluating the plant for scheduling, may be spurred to prohibit the plant as well. In anticipation of similar action by the DEA, the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics (CCLE) has established a SALVIA DIVINORUM DEFENSE FUND for the purpose of raising the money necessary to present a legal challenge to any scheduling move by the DEA. In October of last year, a group of experts coordinated by the CCLE submitted a written report to the US DEA, finding that Salvia divinorum does not meet the criteria for inclusion in Schedule I of the US Controlled Substance Act.

The CCLE continues to monitor Salvia divinorum's legal situation on a daily basis. With your support, we will be able to mount a legal challenge to a future scheduling move by the US DEA.

Additional Details about the Australian Scheduling Decision



The NDPSC's decision to place the S. divinorum and its active principle into Schedule 9 – a schedule reserved for drugs with a "high potential for abuse" and which present a "risk to public health and safety" – appears to have no factual support. 

At its August 2001 meeting, The NDPSC considered scheduling S. divinorum, noting that the plant was being "advertis[ed] for sale in Australia and some broad based e-mail discussion groups on Australian web sites have included discussion threads on Salvia divinorum." 

Traditional shamanic use of the plant was discounted by the NDPSC, which dismissively commented, "There was no evidence of traditional therapeutic use other than in shamanistic healing rituals."

Finally, while placement in Schedule 9 requires a finding that the plant or substance presents a public health problem, the NDPSC made an end-run around this important criterion, stating:

 "The Jurisdictions advised the Committee that they had not been advised that this herb was causing public health problems, however this may simply reflect the relative "newness" of the herb as a potential substance of abuse."

The NDPSC concluded its August 2001 meeting by noting: "there appear[s] to be a prima facie case for control of Salvia divinorum as an hallucinogen, but ... there was no evidence of a major public health hazard at this stage. Accordingly, the Committee agreed to foreshadow appropriate Schedule 9 entries and seek public comment

At its next meeting, held in November 2001, the NDPSC noted "there was no response to the pre-meeting gazette notice in relation to the foreshadowed decision to include Salvia Divinorum in Schedule 9 of the SUSDP. However, a Minute was received from the Office of Complementary Medicines of the TGA, thanking the Committee for considering the inclusion of S. divinorum into the SUSDP on public health and safety grounds."

Yet, with no more evidence than what existed (or didn't exist) in August 2001, the NDPSC then summarily ruled (Decision 2001/33-7) to include "Salvia Divinorum in Schedule 9 of the SUSDP, on the basis of high potential for abuse and risk to public health and safety." 

In addition, the NDPSC included in Schedule 9 "8-METHOXYCARBONYL-4A,8A-DIMETHYL-6-ACETOXY- 5-KETO-3,4,4B,7,9,10,10A-SEPTAHYDRO-3-(4-FURANYL)- 2,1-NAPHTHO[4,3-E]PYRONE *(SALVINORIN A)."

181 30 erikdavisms2 from Trip6 Psychedelic Culture: One or Many? Erik Davis What I'd like to do here is paint a picture of psychedelic culture and how it relates to the larger world that we're in. There are a lot of interesting angles with which people approach psychedelic culture. Of course there've always been very different models of how psychedelics influence the greater culture - how they should influence it, and how they do influence it. If you go back to the Sixties, sometimes we have a simplistic idea that the counterculture was one great wave of psychedelic experience that was united in its ethos, in its ways of thinking about what way the world should go. That's not really the case. There were a lot of very different subsets of people, even at that time. You had people driven very much by a kind of psychotherapeutic approach - how is this going to help in dealing with individual psychology, and the psychology of groups. You had the sort of elitist perennialism of Aldous Huxley and his school. On the other side of it, you had the Prankster approach, which was far more anarchic - let's throw it all out there and see what happens, let's spread it wide, let's bring it all down. You had the great tensions between, especially in the Seventies, Timothy Leary and Ram Dass. At some point in the Sixties, Leary was often seen as sort of a semi-guru guy, but at a certain point he really very strongly turned away from that model, from the custard mush of Hindu spirituality, and became much more invested in a kind of proto-extropian, highly technological view of the future of humanity. Whereas on the other hand, you had his former colleague, Richard Alpert, really keeping the connections between psychedelic experience and a variety of mystical and spiritual traditions very closely bound. 

So even if we look at the background of where we've come from, we see a lot of divergence. And today we also have a great deal of divergence. You have people who are very scientifically oriented and in many ways quite skeptical of the kinds of claims you can make about the worlds of experience that psychedelics open up. On the other hand, you have a very strong pull towards religion and/or spirituality in certain kinds of forms; there's the idea that there are certain spirits behind these experiences, that they have a kind of collective message, and that by engaging in this we're learning a certain kind of truth which is organized often by certain institutions or groups. This divergence of course is extremely productive. It's very dynamic; it's very open-ended. The best aspect of psychedelic culture in terms of what it presents to the larger culture is this open-endedness, a lack of resolution, a constant dynamic interplay between matter and spirit, science and experience, subjectivity and chemistry. That tension of constantly moving relationships is in many ways what makes this such a productive and fascinating part of our culture. 

But what does "psychedelic culture" mean? In the broader respects, in many ways you can look outside and say that psychedelics won. If you look at advertising, if you look at MTV, if you look at computer graphics, if you look at a lot of things inside of the emerging cybersphere, you will find traces and sometimes overt quotations of psychedelic experience and psychedelic culture. I'm sure if you took some of the advertisements you see for soda pop and international financial institutions back to 1967 and said, "Check this out," they'd say, "Wow, that's the stuff." And that's a fascinating tale. If we ever know - and I do hope someday we know -the extent of the influence of psychedelics on the computer industry, I'm sure it's remarkable. And we know some of what that is, but for obvious reasons, it's a story that remains untold. I was talking to Lawrence Hagerty [author of "The Spirit of the Internet: Speculations on the Evolution of Global Consciousness"] who was talking about how Sun Microsystems is beating the pants off some of the other monsters out there, and Sun is one major corporation out there that doesn't do drug testing. Very interesting [applause] 

So clearly the ideas and experiences of this culture are trickling out and they have all sorts of influences that are hard to trace. What really interests me is how this psychedelic experience and psychedelic thinking can engage with the world that we're moving into, a much broader and very strange and rapidly changing world. 

SHAMANISM

What's a nice, traditional, solid model of the function of psychedelics within a larger culture? We have the great image of the shaman, a very romanticized image, very overwritten in many ways, used to mean many different things outside of its original ethnographic context. I'm not going to go into any specifics about particular shamanic cultures, but I would like to draw sort of a general picture to point out something I think is very important about psychedelic culture. One thing you can say about the shaman or witch is that she lives on the edge of cultural maps. The shaman can be seen as a kind of interface between the specific human culture of a particular tribal group and the world outside, a world that we can think of not only as nature, of course, but the cosmic, the spiritual. The witch lives at the edge of the village as we start to move into the wild. And that's a very potent way of thinking about that relationship of being a transfer point between the outside and the inside of specific human cultures. One of those interesting paradoxes of shamanism is that, on the one hand, it is very technological, very savvy, full of knowledge in almost a modern sense of knowledge, like scientific knowledge. And yet the worlds that are being produced and performed are extremely cultural, spiritual, mythological. Look at a healing ceremony, and think about what exactly is happening in a healing ceremony. Let's say that the illness is healed through the use of quartz crystals being pulled out of the body.  What's happening there? What's really going on?

One way of looking at it is that the shaman is playing a two-fold game. On the one hand, he knows very well what he's actually doing, that he's pirated a little quartz crystal in his palm, that he's using very specific plants which have very specific properties which engaged together can produce effects, both specifically related to health and in larger psychoactive issues as well. There's a tremendous amount of knowledge there. And yet, what does the shaman do in the actual situation of the healing? She performs. And what she performs is a whole cultural embeddedness of those knowledges, not simply as in our modern science - "take this pill, it'll work out for you." The knowledge is kept on the inside. And what the person perceives is a cultural story, of the illness being removed from the body. So it's not that the shaman is a skeptical trickster just playing games with quartz crystals. It's that the shaman understands some of the technology of producing cultural knowledge and transformation within that cultural matrix, and is willing to perform it as if it were fully engaged. We're realizing now that the placebo effect plays a tremendous role in healing of all sorts. And so to artfully produce the placebo effect is of course an incredibly valuable activity. 

But again, what is the function here? The shaman takes a sort of liminal role. Liminality is a concept in anthropology that describes, again, a place on the edge of cultural maps, a place between the wild and the culture, between hot and cold, between different villages. A place of tremendous liminal power in the ancient world were crossroads. Crossroads were where people from different cultures would encounter each other. And there's a whole mythology of trickster figures - Hermes, Coyote, these kinds of characters - are figures that model this relationship between inside and out. Liminality is a very important way of approaching what function, what role, what space in the whole overall cultural environment psychedelics take up. 

So if you look at this model, it's a very exciting model. Of course, many people in attempting to really take advantage of psychedelic drugs in the modern world have looked to the model of shaman healer. It's an exciting model to try to emulate in some fashion or another. But there's one very important distinction, I believe, between the world view of the traditional shaman healer and what we are faced with, which is that we do not have a coherent, contained world view. We no longer have a specific cultural story that can be performed in that mythological sense. We're at this very strange juncture in history when all these cultures are smashing into each other, we have globalization, we have fragmentation, it's a very open-ended situation. I think sometimes if there's an error in the shamanic interpretation of modern psychedelic culture, it's a kind of romanticism that wants to reconstruct or re-embody some fully coherent mythological world view. I don't want to say that in a way that undercuts the power of ancient myths and ancient knowledge. Of course one of the things that composes modern psychedelic culture is knowledges, is reception of stories, practices from the world over, and those things inform our evolving picture or cultural story about what we're doing, because that cultural story helps make the reality of experience come to be. But I think that sometimes there's a desire or a tendency to want that story to be fully realized, so that we know that actually what we're doing is engaging the mind of the planet, and the planet is telling us something. And I think in some ways those are very valuable stories, but at the same time, I think it's very important to recognize that, at the moment, we are still part of this tremendous, bizarre, horrible and fascinating process of technological modernity. We can see it breaking apart. We can see its horrible claws, its absences, and there's a desire to overcome these things quickly, or overcome them fully or entirely, leave that framework entirely in order to enter into a different kind of re-enchanted world. That desire to re-enchant the world is a profound thing that we're all feeling. It's incredibly legitimate. And yet, I think that the way in which we move forward with that is not by recovering simply a kind of mythological world view. We must keep up our relationship with those aspects of modernity that are part of psychedelic culture. 

SCIENCE

One of the more obvious models, of course, is science. And one of the paradoxes if you approach psychedelics from a scientific point of view is that on the one hand, obviously we're dealing with material substances. Obviously we're dealing with chemistry. We're dealing with tiny little objects that we can describe in the institutionalized, image-free language of science. And yet, these compounds open up worlds which seem to pull the rug out from under a more limited view of science. And yet, and yet, we cannot fully inhabit the magical, open-ended world, because we are also very much aware of the fact that they are material compounds, produced through material means that are playing all sorts of games and fascinating tricks on our neural systems. So it's a kind of Möbius strip, where the trigger opens up the space that pulls out the rug from under the whole world of triggers, the whole world of mechanism. And yet, we can't entirely resolve that, we can't leave the world where we're still acknowledging the tremendous complexity and marvels of natural science. So that's why psychedelics, more than most regions of the culture, are a place for getting very close to this magic line, where it's almost a tight rope walk between these different world views. 

Another very important aspect about psychedelics, from the perspective of more materialist and scientific ways of looking at the world, is the question it poses about consciousness, and whether first-person perspectives have any value in our attempts to understand what consciousness is. There's a tremendous amount of energy amongst the people who are doing the most work to describe what's happening in consciousness from the perspective of the brain. There's a tremendous tendency in that world to deny first-person experience as a valid way of understanding what's happening in consciousness; we can only really talk about it from a third-person perspective. Someone like Daniel Dennett is a great example of this, where any sort of internal information you get from meditation, from drugs, etc., it's just not really worth very much because we can't really capture it entirely in the kinds of frameworks that science prefers. But that's what makes it so powerful and so productive, because it's like we're opening up a gate inside of the scientific worldview, but what comes in that gate cannot be captured by it entirely. We see the same kinds of things happening now, as there's more discussion of a sort of neurology of mysticism or spiritualism, like the cover of Newsweek recently on "God and the brain." It's again a very similar kind of topic. Interestingly, they did not raise the issue of psychedelics at all. But they were approaching this odd point where we're beginning to get pretty good at a third-person description of a lot of what's going on with some of the most exalted and powerful states that human beings can achieve. And yet, there's something sort of obvious: if we're getting so close to it from this third-person perspective, how can we possibly not include a first-person perspective? 

But then it actually feeds into an aspect of our culture that is very frightening, which is a certain tendency towards control, towards the idea that what causes human beings to be the way they are are a whole set of factors that can be controlled from the outside, for the interests of this kind of way of thinking. You find it in government, you find it in science, you find it in psychotherapy, you find it in motivational speaking, you find it in all sorts of places, this tendency to say, "Well, all you have to do is trigger human beings a certain way and they will be happy or they will be productive in a capitalist sense." And so the tendency to think about consciousness from a strictly third-person point of view also plays very much into the hands of the people who believe they can use third-person perspectives in order to organize such activity. Whereas if you stepped across that line and said, "This is absurd, of course I'm going to plunge in with my own individual consciousness and make inferences, make discoveries, explore myself, explore social interaction from the perspective of these new states," you're already just in that investigation making a claim for the primary importance of subjective experience as a place to instruct, to understand, and to relate to the world. So that's another way in which psychedelics have a very interesting trickiness, because even from the perspective of hard core third-person scientists, they're inevitably fascinated by these compounds on some level or another. And yet, the closer you get to these substances, the more they pull you into a very different kind of world. It becomes more difficult to account for the phenomenon from that perspective. So it's sort of eating in and eroding some of the more regressive and reductive tendencies inside of brain science.

SET & SETTING

These compounds pull the rug out from under from simple mechanistic cosmology. We all know about set and setting. Set and setting have a tremendously powerful role in producing experience. But set and setting are not mechanistic activities. They're cultural elements. They're narrative elements. They have to do with meaning. So by going into a psychedelic experience, even from a skeptical point of view, anyone who's really investigating the phenomenon will recognize that your own mind frame, and your own physical setting, will help produce the different qualities of the events. So there's no way to fully account for that from the perspective of brain science alone. You have to go to culture. You have to go to the shaman's performance, the fact that it looks like I'm pulling a quartz crystal out of your body at some point or another. So it opens up this whole problem or issue of self-programming, programming environment, intentionality. And all of those elements, especially intentionality, are precisely the elements that are extremely vital for us to keep at the center of our vision as we move into what I often fear is a fairly concerted attack on certain kinds of individual liberties and the liberties of consciousness itself.

But again, there's kind of an interesting problem, which is the same thing that I talked about with the shamanic worldview. If we were in a traditional society, the framework, the intention, the set and setting would be a given. We are brought up in it, we already know to some extent what's going on, what's going to happen with these experiences, and they are organized and explained and integrate us, because we already have that map. We've grown up into it, it's in the background, and maybe the shaman is a technician of culture, aware of how to maintain that cultural reality to some degree, using things that are maybe not included in that cultural reality, even using tricks to maintain that perception for the tribe. But we don't have that option any more. So what do we do? What is our intention? What is the frame? What is the set and setting that we organize? These are very big questions.

THE CORPORATE STATE

How does the liminal role of psychedelics fit into our world in terms of policy, in terms of the law? It's interesting to look at the role of psychedelic culture within the larger picture of drugs as constructed by the state, or by the concurrent consensus reality. What interests me is that in some ways, it's not a bad thing. And I don't mean that to say that it's not bad that people are being incarcerated and having their lives ruined. Obviously major suffering goes down and I'm not talking about that. What I'm trying to say is that nonetheless, it puts psychedelic culture in a very curious place inside the larger cultural framework. It has some very productive qualities to it.

One of those is that it avoids some of the traps that occur with any sort of mainstream or corporate or state-oriented recuperation of psychoactive substances. This really came to me in an interesting way. I'm not entirely sure I believe myself on this one, but I do think it's an interesting issue to raise. When Rick Doblin [founder and president of MAPS] was talking about his plan to get MDMA made legal [at the Lindesmith Center-Drug Policy Foundation's "The State of Ecstasy" conference], it was a very sophisticated, very interesting plan. But when he was presenting it, at the end of his presentation he was casting his vision of these "Ecstasy clinics," where people would go and they would be legitimate, and you'd have nice paintings and everything would be set up, and you'd have these kind people who'd be helping you through these sorts of experiences. I kind of had this weird feeling inside. I had this little strange kind of shiver, of like, "Okay, but I don't know that that's all of it." And the reason I say that is that one of the things I think is going to happen - it's already happening, you see it all over the place - is this transformation of the corporate culture of psychoactivity and psychoactive drugs. If you look at Prozac, if you look at Ritalin, you see that there is a willingness inside of civilization or whatever you want to call this particular monster, to willingly use powerful psychoactive drugs in order to restore certain models of normal behavior, certain models of happiness, certain models of satisfaction. And there's nothing wrong with happiness or satisfaction. There's nothing wrong with recognizing profoundly dysfunctional behaviors and finding ways, even very technological ways, of overcoming those behaviors. Nonetheless, there is something that happens when those activities and those possibilities become incorporated into the state. And by the state, I don't just mean the government. I mean the kind of large corporate state that we live in. And so there's a profound difference between decriminalization and legalization. And we're not anywhere near a point where we're going to be able to deal with these things. At the moment, people are suffering and we have to fight that battle, and again I'm not talking about keeping things the way they are. But what I am talking about is that I don't think it's an accident that psychedelics occupy this curious position

MDMA is a very different category in a lot of ways. MDMA is operating again in a very liminal space, between the crazy world of psychedelics that must be suppressed - those wild and crazy kids, those nuts from California - and Prozac. So you start to see mainstream media going, "This stuff's not so bad!" The New York Times, Time magazine: "Hmm, you know, it's not that different from the serotonin-based SSRIs and such."  But one of the things about that is because Ecstasy by itself, though incredibly productive and marvelous in so many ways, does not puncture consensus reality the way psychedelics puncture consensus reality. And so I don't think it's an accident that it's in this zone, because in some ways you can imagine a reorganization of our current environment in which Ecstasy is somehow integrated. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just that as soon as you start to integrate it, then it becomes manipulated by that cultural machine, which has agendas that have nothing to do necessarily with you feeling better, with you discovering more love and intimacy in your life. It becomes a regulatory mechanism, a way of managing human subjectivity in an increasingly dense and chaotic and open-ended social environment.

So in some ways, psychedelics have a very interesting place because they're not integrated into that world. And for me, one of the things that is the most productive and full of potential about them is that they're going to puncture your consensus reality. They're going to knock you out of whatever that structure is, even in terms of your models of healing, even in terms of your models of deeper interconnection with nature. You think you're going to get the great earth momma embracing you in some kind of jaguar-rich forest, and you get sucked into some sort of interdimensional wormhole built by malevolent-looking insectoid creatures, and you go, "Man, I was going for the nature vibe sort of thing!" That's great. It's that pulling the rug out from under you. And so it's very interesting to look at the difference between MDMA and psychedelic culture in that sense.

RELIGION & SPIRITUALITY

The final zone I want to talk about in terms of this liminality is religion or spirituality. A good example of something analogous to where we are in terms of the role of psychedelics in our spiritual/religious quest today from history is to look at the mystery religions of late antiquity. Many people have drawn what I think are very valid connections between the last few centuries of the Roman Empire, and our world now. You have a potentially globalized environment full of huge varieties of different kinds of people, a sort of mechanized state that is very efficient but utterly corrupt at the top. You have a very urban environment, in which many different kinds of people are coming together, and people are pulled out of their tribal connections to the places they come from. There's a lot more movement in the empire. And it's in this environment that you see the rise of the mystery religions. Not particularly the famous mystery religion of Eleusis, which is a very important part of our psychedelic story, but was actually much older than most of these mystery religions. But it was more the sense that the way to serve this spiritual hunger was to enter into these cult sects, where at the heart of the whole operation was an experience, an otherworldly experience. And they were not by any means all produced by psychoactive substances; in fact, I don't think you necessarily need very much psychoactive substances involved in the production of these kinds of mystical experiences in order for them to be very heavy and transformative. And yet there was a desire for this kind of experience, for a sense of the self that went beyond the body, that was very similar to now. 

So it's interesting to think about how we relate to this model of the mystery religions. I see an unfortunate reductive tendency of some psychedelic research, particularly the historical stuff, to find behind all of these vast mysteries of religions across the globe some kind of substance that's "actually" producing things. We know there's something going on with soma, we know there's something going on with Eleusis, we know that stuff is going on, and there's little fragments of it here and there, and we want to reconstruct what is actually going on. In this way, we're very modern still. We're still looking for the mechanism. We're still looking for the actual substance that allows these things to be. It's my belief that once you take into account the way that cultural reality can program or set up a certain set of expectations, a certain set of experiences, then you actually don't need many chemicals thrown into the mix in order to produce a tremendously powerful experience, and I always find it unfortunate when in some psychedelic historiography, it's almost saying, "Real spirituality is the psychedelic experience, and everything else we see is a pale reflection of it, some attempt to recapture it using some longer, slower, more painful method, or leaving aside the methods, you just have some crusty, dogmatic ideology that is the leftover of this living spiritual experience." I mean, in some ways I think that's probably an accurate description in a lot of respects, but I think it also misses a lot, and one of the things it does is it cuts against our willingness to look at what those cultural frameworks are, what the stories are that are embedded in these experiences. By overly emphasizing the "secret mushroom" behind all of the iconography or all of the lore, I think we tend to undercut the role of meaning, the role of our ongoing cultural frameworks in producing these experiences.

Another issue that's raised by the mystery religions is the larger question about what is the role of experience spiritually in the first place? There's a fairly consensus idea that we have spirituality over here, we have religion over there, and they kind of overlap. Spirituality on whatever level is about your experiences: what's actually happening, how you're becoming more integrated, your mystical experiences, the real deal, the immediacy of spirit. Whereas religion we tend to associate very justly with institutional frameworks, with collective stories, with power relations, with manifest social relationships. And there's this curious sort of balance between the two. What you have with a traditional mystery religion is that at the heart of it, there is something like gnosis. Maybe it's produced through a substance, maybe not. But there is an experience, a profound experience of the divine, of the otherworldly. And yet, again, it is embedded in this whole set of stories and frameworks, which a) help produce the shape of those experiences, and b) even more importantly, help integrate the residue of those experiences into ordinary life. 

So there's a tendency, a very strong one and very understandable, inside of psychedelic spirituality, to say, "This stuff is getting us to the goods, now we can skip all that 'religion' stuff and get right to the heart of it. We can go spiritual, we don't need religion in the broadest and most positive sense of the word." But I'm not entirely sure that that sums up the issue, because again I think without a certain kind of framework for understanding and integrating, then the spiritual experience, even the most profound state of gnosis, can become a kind of wacky hedonism. Nothing wrong with hedonism. But you probably people know people like this, or you can see it in the culture very much, where any kind of substance that you're taking in a de-mythologized environment where you're buying a piece of blotter or you're taking a pill, however you try to frame it, it can become just a mechanistic repetition. It can lose any edge of genuine openness and integration. 

But I don't have an answer for this, because I don't know what these frames are. I don't know what the big maps are. I tend to be very distrustful of people who know what the big map is. They "know" what the story is that's organizing these experiences. We can see, for example, if you look at some Brazilian ayahuasca sects, there are some very interesting things that are happening there from a religious anthropology perspective. And yet, it doesn't take much interaction with them to see things that at least from a Western perspective are difficult: institutional hierarchies, ways of saying what's a good experience, what's a bad experience, what is the meaning of all this, and answering those questions beforehand becomes somewhat authoritarian in a traditional religious way. So it can have a great deal of social power and actually aid people in a lot of ways, and yet I think a lot of us in psychedelic culture are uncomfortable with that. So once again this is that "in betwixt, in between": we know there are frames, we know that by accepting and creating a spiritual environment, a spiritual story, the experiences themselves will have a much greater richness. (I mean, sometimes they'll just come in and do whatever they're going to do anyway, but that is very much a part of it.) And yet, what is our frame? What really is the story we're telling ourselves? I don't have an answer for that, but it fascinates me very much that there is something to the need to produce these cultural frameworks. 

And I'm not sure whether the kinds of frameworks that we have so far are sufficient. If you look at them, what are the two main ones you can talk about? One of them is the therapeutic model. Again, incredibly productive, and yet I'm not always so sure whether that is getting at the real heart of the spiritual potential of these molecules. Another example is rave culture. That's probably the best example of a kind of mass movement with a great deal of cultural power, within which people are having tremendous psychoactive experiences, and which is organized in a certain way to produce trance effects, to suggest certain kinds of images which are keying off archetypes, the drugs really plug into the music and the music plugs into the drugs, as an example of the way that technology and the drug states are really mirroring each other and as they evolve, they sort of co-create these environments. Again, they're incredibly rich and productive in some ways, and yet in other ways I don't think you have to be too much of a worrywart to look at some aspects of rave culture, and wonder, what are they doing? What is this for? What's going on here? There's always that tendency, particularly in our culture, to have things turned into a form of entertainment or a form of numbing yourself. 

And so the question I always ask myself is: How can you communicate the best aspects of "psychedelic values"? There are certain kinds of psychedelic values that many people develop after a long apprenticeship with these things. I mean, I know I've met individuals from older generations, and there's just certain things you pick up, a certain kind of openness, a certain kind of tolerance, a certain kind of sweetness, a certain kind of mirth that really strikes me as part of these values. They're almost unspoken. How do you transmit these? Is there a way to transmit them? Is it all just out of control? As soon as you start to try to control it, then you make it more like religion, you make it more like "this is the right way and this is the wrong way." And yet, in some ways the chaotic effects of introducing these things at an increasingly mass level are worrying. 

So again, I don't have a lot of answers. But I really just wanted to paint a big picture, throwing out some questions that I know will be approached from a variety of different ways within our culture. Of course, one of the good things about the old mystery religions and that kind of model is that they're esoteric. There's levels of secrecy. And so in order to work yourself up to the encounter, the experience, you have to go through a lot of social machinery, a lot of preparation, a lot of preparing yourself for not really necessarily knowing what goes on. And that structure also allows the production of wisdom people, whether you call them shamans, whether you call them masters, whatever you want to call people who know their stuff, who know these worlds inside and out, but there's a way that that knowledge passes on. There's apprentices, and those apprentices are able to reproduce those environments, changing them always slightly as the culture itself transforms. Now we're in an information environment, where that kind of hermeticism still goes on, and it's vital that it does go on - most secret elite pockets are vital to the continual creation of this culture and its encounters with psychoactives. But it's also the case that the genie is seriously out of the bottle. It's much easier in some senses to "get" things, to pluck on the information networks and come up with a lot of very powerful information, that in a more traditional society would be highly guarded by the wacky alchemists, the witch at the edge of the village. Now it's all open. That raises some really interesting ethical issues.

<b>GB</b>: Shakatura is a thread in the magik carpet of Bay Area musicians, artists, dancers, activists and healers committed to raising a positive vibe for anyone in range. It is an artistic costume worn primarily by Galen Butler but shared among various musical and artistic collaborators. It was conjured and is being developed as a magikal mainline to the healing powers of music and dance.

<b>TRIP</b>: How long have you been making music?

<b>GB</b>: My earliest musical memory is of playing a kid's drum covered with dayglo orange funfur at about age 5. This was a clear sign of how things would unfold later. Guitar came into the picture during high school and there was much epic psy-fi noodling and whiteboy jambalaya in subsequent years. A computer-based studio started taking shape in 1996. The idea of painting
with a limitless digital palette of sounds really appealed to me in a way that no single traditional instrument ever had. It was like my imagination had finally found it's native tool.

In 1998, I was playing guitar and electronics in a SF-based rock project called Dreamspy. This band was a sort of initial run at fusing the kind of acid and progressive rock we'd cut our teeth on with contemporary electronic textures and dance floor punch. It was a tall order, one which the band didn't survive long enough to fill, though we were pointed in the right direction. This sort of "organic-electronic" live dance band concept is still a vision of mine. In the Bay Area, acts like Sound Tribe Sector 9, Lost at Last and Medicine Drum, among others, are honing different spins on this idea.

<b>TRIP</b>: What first inspired you to make this particular CD?

<b>GB</b>: I moved to California from New England in 1996 and became immediately submerged in San Francisco's dance music culture, especially the psychedelic trance scene. The color and energy of this music really absorbed me for a good three or four years. In parallel, artists like Mixmaster Morris, Adham Shaikh and Simon Posford were releasing some beautifully sophisticated ambient dub music that was really accessing beautiful and powerful spaces. So as I started putting tracks together, I suppose they landed somewhere on the periphery of these immediate influences. I wanted to make an album that had dance floor elements and lush headphone appeal as well. Within the electro-funk-dub stylistic mishmash on the album, there's something for the body, something for the mind, something for the spirit; that kind of thing.

It's a wonderful thing when music can effect people on different levels and really open the whole organism. This is what I'm trying to do with music - open up and let it pour though from the highest and funkiest and most healing sources available.

<b>TRIP</b>: What gear/software did you use to create the tracks on Shakatura?

<b>GB</b>: The music on the first CD came together gradually at the stormy confluence of sonic inspiration and technical pro wrestling. The studio was in serious flux over the course of the album's production. A lot of vintage analog synths and a bunch of newer digital synths and samplers were involved. The production environment used on Shakatura was Steinberg's Cubase VST on a Macintosh. I haven't played a synthesizer I like more than the Access Virus B for range and sound quality. I use a EMu rack module as a Swiss army knife of drum sounds and samples. A Studio Electronics ATC-1 serves up the pure analog butter and cream.

Of course it helps tremendously to play a traditional instrument, and have friends who play instruments. Electronic music has created a range of new musical aesthetics that completely discard any traditional instrumental tones and ensembles we're used to hearing in favor of a completely synthetic sound. Personally, I'm into fusion and integration of electronic and traditional instrumentation and I think this comes across on the album.

Seems to me that, beyond the basics, one's choice of particular tools is not as important as one's understanding of them. The computer is the heart of any digital composition system, acting as multi track recorder, sampler, synthesizer, drum machine, and mastering suite. With an average personal computer and a single good synthesizer, the only limitations are time, imagination, and patience.



<b>TRIP</b>: Did you use many samples or was the sound all homegrown?

<b>GB</b>: All the synth sounds were generated in the studio. Some of the samples come from sample disc libraries made for the purpose, some come from field DAT recordings, some from experimental goofing around. Everything audible is fair game if you can record it. This album does not really go as far as I'd like to eventually in terms of mining the world's technosphere and biosphere for interesting sounds. The album is about 85% an electronic studio creation, and it sounds like it. Moving forward, each track and definitely each album release will bump the ceiling of complexity. It has to be this way to stay interesting.

<b>TRIP</b>: What do you call the type of music on this album? Trip house? Organic downtempo? Murky disco? How would you classify it?

<b>GB</b>: Murky disco? A new sub-genre is born! Friends of mine were kicking around the term "psy-hop" a few years ago to describe a fusion of psychedelic trance and hip-hop. This term was describing something super fat and funky; something equally trippy but not as morose or jazzy as a lot of trip hop. The name game is endless of course, especially when you're mixing genres. The music on Shakatura pulls from downtempo electronic, ambient, breakbeat, trance, house, funk, disco, and rock. If there's one thing that's truly unique about it, I'd say it's this stylistic fusion.

<b>TRIP</b>: What's your favorite track on the album and why?

<b>GB</b>: That's a tough one, because I've liked them all best at one time or another. The opening track, "Lava Tube," I think best captures the lush and colorful spirit that surrounded this project. "Quark" is a nice one too. "Playa Mimosa," which opens, by the way, with a field recording from post-burn chaos at Burning Man 2001, will be remixed on the next album. That was the last track made, and the one pointing the direction into the current work.

<b>TRIP</b>: What other CDs are you listening to right now? Got any tips for us?

<b>GB</b>: In my opinion, anything on Interchill Records is really the top of the stack as far as organic-electronic ambient music goes. There are two new compilations coming out on this label within the next few months, and based on the prospective track listings, I'd recommend them both. Meditation2 is also forthcoming on Ceiba Records and will be great as well. There's a little list of enduring releases on the website at <a href="http://www.shakatura.com">shakatura.com</a> in the music section.

<b>TRIP</b>: So you did the cover art for the album as well. It's pretty inspired. You've got some sort of Vedic calendrical mandala, a strand of DNA, pristine rainforests, sacred eye portals... What's going on here?

<b>GB</b>: Well, if you've worked with the Tarot at all, that's how I think about this image. It's a sort of mandala, an integrated collection of symbols which reflect related aspects of the psyche in a (hopefully) meaningful way. As this image was coming together, it became apparent that it was representing the level at which human identity is balanced within the earth's biosphere. The lunar/astrological calendar reminds us that the motion of time is a concert of energy, made of meaning, ultimately beyond cause and effect; that everything is tightly wound in a web of synchronicity on all levels. We can develop awareness of events as synchronic and work with this understanding: in music, in relationships, in work of any kind. The DNA spiral represents the unbroken evolutionary chain and the energetic distillery of life on this planet. It is the single organism differentiated into myriad shapes. When we feel this relationship on a cellular level, a tree or bacteria is literally "another Yourself." The waters, forests and sky represent the interpenetrating levels of the biosphere inhabited by and maintained by this DNA creatrix. The moth wings with floating eyes represent lunar vision, the ability to view and integrate unconscious psychic contents and transhuman energies through fearless interior exploration. The central eye, which is the eye of a human infant, represents transparent vision, the pure unencumbered state of witness to existence, gracefully embodying all potentials. The music sounds really good from this vantage point ;-).

185 30 shakatura Trip 8 Shakatura a groovin' head trip through lush organic downtempo James Kent One artist who fits the image of the modern psychedelic Renaissance man is
San Francisco's Galen Butler, also known as Shakatura. Butler recently released
an eponymous titled debut from Shakatura on Ceiba Records, and it is probably
one of my favorite albums of the year. Grooving with an organic house vibe from
start to finish, Shakatura booms and rolls with lush bass lines, phat breaks,
and swirling synths that bloom and sting with simultaneous hints of Eros and
menace.

While moving through various downtempo moods and spaces Shakatura steps and
swings along with ease, always maintaining an entirely chilled out demeanor,
unafraid to get comfortable in a specific zone and just roll with the flow for a
while. Yet within the meaty grooves lie the deep processes of time passing,
planets spinning, life evolving, each bathed in the ever-present
electro-harmonic radiance that ties it all together. Even when sober there are
parts of Shakatura that leave me envisioning the elegant dance of intracellular
process, the tiny wet machinery of life metabolizing through time at the
bio-molecular level. It is a soothing yet endlessly fascinating pulse, flowing
and combusting along with the organic groove of life. And if your booty stays
still while listening to it you are probably dead.

Although shakatura is hard to classify it is very easy to listen to. It embraces
the best aspects of both downtempo and beatless ambient spaces into tight
organic grooves that keep pumping, moving, and rolling to the end. The entire
album swings with consistent breakbeat chill and trippy soundscapes, and will
definitely enjoy heavy rotation on your sound system.

186 30 duckapus Trip 8 pfly, duckapus experimental ambient spaces, a journey of the mind James Kent One of the greatest things about the psychedelic community is the wide variety
of unique do-it-yourself artists and musicians who populate the scene. Holistic
artists like these typify the values of the renaissance creators, blending
philosophy, technology, music, and art into a tidy package of alchemical sound
and vision, handily compatible with any home CD player and guaranteed to
stimulate any set of eyes and ears the planet.

One such renaissance musician is pfly, also known as Paul Fly. pfly has been
producing underground ambient and experimental tracks for years now, but with
Duckapus, his latest release, he has taken the art form to a new level. Every
snippet of sound on this CD was assembled from the ground up by Fly, mixed and mastered in his own home studio. Even the curiously
enfractaled art on the CD sleeve comes from his desktop, making the entire
package a start-to-finish holographic representation of pfly's head space.

Duckapus is a very strange and unique album, moving through lush organic spaces,
squeaking dissociative noise machinery, and churning caverns of dark mystical
power, each one bubbling over with the potential to explode into states of pure
chaos at any moment. The mind states flow seamlessly from one to other, some
leaving you in the warm folds of sonic bliss, others sending you spiraling into
darkness, others spinning your awareness forty-five degrees in space while
simultaneously giving your light vehicle a two-and-a-half minute lube and tune.

Whether you're being pounded by hammers of insanity or washed over with
electro-harmonic love plasma, the great joy of this album is never knowing where
you're going to end up next. Some transitions are organic and exotic, others
creep out of nowhere and take control, others pass you through hellish corridors
of torment before alighting you into a field of fresh wild flowers at sunrise.
Duckapus leaves you with the sensation that a grand dreamlike voyage has been
undertaken, a skittering surreal journey through the many joys and pains of
existence. Duckapus is also an immaculately crafted album, each passage deep and
complex with simultaneous unfolding and enfoldment of mood and sound. In short
it is a production tour de force, and certainly has the depth to listen to over
and over again, always discovering new glittering snippets and pieces, like tiny
polished gems awash in a great ocean of sound.

609 30 signal_theory Psychedelic Information Theory Signal Theory Overview A technical overview of Signal Theory, a new model of consciousness proposed by James Kent James Kent Signal Theory presents a new model for objectively measuring expanded states of consciousness based on neural firing rate, synchrony of neural spiking, and intensity of signal feedback recursion occurring within the sensory processing circuits of neocortex. Signal Theory also proposes methodologies for mathematically modeling the action of psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonists in the production of diminished, amplified, and standing sensory feedback loops in simple neural circuits. Using the basic tenets of Signal Theory, we can describe an empirical model in which both normal waking consciousness and expanded psychedelic consciousness can be defined.

1200 34 1200 www.cdreviews.com CD review: Lewis Taylor - Stoned Lewis Taylor has an interesting story. A modern psychedelic soul singer and producer dedicated to the themes of love and obsession; his one-man compositions likened to past and modern greats like Stevie Wonder, Justin Timberlake, and Prince; and a temperment so moody he is in and out of the music business two times in as many decades leaving little but lauding critical praise and confused fans in his wake?

This may sound like just another "Behind the Music" episode, but listen to Taylor's music (you can find tracks on his Hacktone and MySpace pages listed below) and you realize it is the work of an obsessive perfectionist dedicated to getting his sound just right.

From a recent review on CDReviews.com:

<blockquote>Possibly one of the best pure soul records of the last decade comes from an artist hardly no one has heard about. At least, not on this side of the pond anyway. In England, where Taylor is from, it may be another matter, though he is more of an underground cult star there than an established name.  At one time a guitarist in a revived version of the Edgar Broughton Band in the mid '80's, Taylor would eventually succumb to the temptations of the road and would vanish for a while, mired in a nasty drug and alcohol haze that consumed his career. But not before he released two great psychedelic rock albums under the pseudonym Sheriff Jack. These albums sank without a trace, and Taylor proceeded to vanish for better part of a decade.</blockquote>

His latest US release, <i>Stoned</i> (part one, there is a part two, just not available in the states yet), is not a return to form as much as a perfection of the form Taylor has been striving for all these years away from the spotlight. A right meloncholy wanker prone to fits of solitude and depression, Taylor ranks right up there with Brian Wilson, Nick Drake, and Elliot Smith in the cannon of self-destructive musical geniuses. He's so tempermental that his official website now says he has "retired" from the music business despite being named one of the best artists to watch by Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, and many others who should know. His music makes you feel good, sad, comforted, disturbed, all at the same time. Hauntingly poppy magic, nostalgia in a bottle, so rich and warm I just can't explain. 

While somewhat inconsistent personally, Taylor's music continues to be simultaneously entrancing, cheesy, poppy, emotionally manipulative, clever, and almost always about the ups and downs (mostly downs) of the that thing we call love. Go to Hacktone.com and listen to some more of his tracks and you will hear his anguished soul shine though.

1207 34 1207 www.newsshopper.co.uk Beware: babies will eat your drugs The latest "Oops, my baby ate my drugs" story, this time from the UK:

<blockquote>A SEVEN-MONTH-OLD girl is stable in hospital after reportedly swallowing an ecstasy tablet.

The baby's condition was originally described as critical after paramedics picked her up from Gravesend High Street at 7pm yesterday.</blockquote>

Now people, how many times have I told you? Don't leave your stash where babies will find it, they'll put anything in their mouths! Luckily this toddler lived, but the chances of disaster are great if you let babies at anything, especially high-powered mood enhancers. So please, for your baby's sake: <i>hide the dope!</i> http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/topstories/display.var.1205696.0.baby_ill_after_swallowing_drug.php 0 0 0 0 babies eat drugs 1 1 jamesk 2007-02-20 21:05:40 2007-02-20 21:07:07 jamesk 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 8 2008-08-13 09:39:16
1208 40 Scot45dbcc01a1549 www.ketv.com 'He was high.  He was high.' Apparently people are still occasionally taking PCP and freaking right the hell out:

<blockquote>Zina Ventry said her son had to go by ambulance to a local hospital after he suffered severe frostbite while he was high.

“He came over and flipped out and that's when we knew he was on PCP,” she said. “He was butt naked. He'd been outside with no clothes on for 45 minutes.”

A police report shows that on that day, Robert Vintry had torn off the hair on the right side of his mother's head and smeared his own feces all over his body.

“He was high,” Zina Vintry said. “He was high.”</blockquote>

You don't say.

Later that day, police received reports of a crazy person going door to door with a knife.  When the cops caught up to the 20-year-old, they wound up killing him.  

I guess everyone fights boredom in their own fashion.  For instance:

<blockquote>Suzanne Nord, the clinical director at NOVA -- a drug treatment center in north Omaha -- evaluates people on PCP in jail. She said that on Thursday afternoon, she talked to two teenage boys who had done PCP.

"He and his friends would intentionally smoke this so they could go out and shoot people," Nord said.</blockquote>

They probably only did that when there was no good TV on, but still. http://www.ketv.com/news/10972024/detail.html?rss=oma&psp=news 0 0 0 0 PCP 1 1 Scotto 2007-02-20 22:38:51 2007-02-20 22:38:51 Scotto 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 10 2008-08-13 09:39:21

2262 59 omgo465bb50217c17 www.promicininfo.com The 4400 I live under a rock, so I might just be the last person to find out about this, but I just came across some promotional web sites for a show from a few years back called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4400">The 4400.</a>  Central to the plot is a drug called promicin which, when injected, sometimes gives people superhero powers.  The linked site is a promotional tie-in for the show; it appears to be an up-to-date blog allegedly describing the experiences of people who took the drug and developed powers.  If you are into that sort of thing, you might get a kick out of it, and the other related sites.  The show doesn't appear all that original to me; sort of "Heroes" meets "X-men 3" but probably not as good as either.  Not that I would know.

It appears the sites just went up this month.  I have no idea why, considering the show has been running since 2004. http://www.promicininfo.com/ 0 0 0 0 television show promotion promicin 4400 0 1 omgoleus 2007-05-29 00:10:02 2007-05-29 00:10:02 omgoleus 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 8 2008-08-01 18:07:54

2264 40 2264 news.yahoo.com Whitney Museum gets people high The Whitney Museum in NYC is staging some kind of Summer of Love retrospective, featuring "posters, artwork, light shows, trippy album covers and experimental film from a counter-cultural movement that brought together peace activists, musicians, hippies and artists."  That all sounds fantastic.  But get a load of some of the PR they're trying to push:

<blockquote>"You can experience the 60s and what it might have been taking LSD without actually having to resort to the drug," [curator Christoph Grunenberg] said.</blockquote>

Riiiiiiight.  Yeah, boy, <i>that</i> will sure bring in the commoners.  You'll get whole field trips from teenagers who are ready to push past DXM and, given their lack of an actual acid connection, think that the Whitney might actually do the trick.  Seriously, they're honestly pushing this kind of thing:

<blockquote>"What I think this exhibition hopefully will do is provide intense experiences," he said. "I think that's a critical element of psychedelic art -- the intense experiences."</blockquote>

And what do these intense experiences actually entail?

<blockquote>The exhibition includes several darkened rooms playing light shows of trippy psychedelic patterns and gently rising lava lamp-style swirls, to a soundtrack of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles.</blockquote>

OMG!!!  Why, I own a lava lamp TOO!  I am SO getting super high this weekend!

2268 40 Scot465c2f52c0b10 www.washingtonpost.com All your prescribing is belong to us Here's something I didn't know: 

<blockquote>The American Medical Association... makes millions of dollars each year by helping data-mining companies link prescribing data to individual physicians. It does so by licensing access to the AMA Physician Masterfile, a database containing names, birth dates, educational background, specialties and addresses for more than 800,000 doctors.</blockquote>

What's the end result of all this data mining?  Physicians are now bombarded with information about the utility of new drugs on the market versus drugs they've been comfortable prescribing up until then.  Indeed, companies with competing drugs on the market can be spurred to make sure your doctor gets the latest and greatest data about his preferred drug's side effects, while at the same time learning all about the benefits of a competitor - and maybe get a nice dinner out of it at the same time.  In some cases doctors are mostly being influenced to start prescribing a drug that is more expensive, not necessarily more effective.

Naturally this is squicking some doctors out, but the opt-out for this program is under-advertised and only lasts three years.  Some states are attempting to pass laws, but so far, legislation has failed on grounds like "you can't restrict free speech."  And in theory, it may not be all bad:

<blockquote>The more a drug representative knows about a physician, the easier it is to provide information that meets the needs of the doctor's practice... "We are about more information and more education, and not less....The vast majority of physicians welcome these people as part of the overall educational process about drugs and their use. And any doctor in the country can close the door to these sales reps. It doesn't require legislation to do that."</blockquote>

Painting the whole situation as "the overall educational process about drugs" seems a little bit quaint, as though this isn't actually "the overall sales and marketing process," but I quibble.  You can imagine cases where this atmosphere actually, if not almost inadvertently, creates some benefits for patients; just as easily, it sounds like a surreptitious drug bazaar where doctors are bombarded with competing messages, and only the company that has the best schwag will truly make an impression on patient care. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/21/AR2007052101701.html 0 0 0 0 big pharma, medical care 0 1 Scotto 2007-05-29 08:51:29 2007-05-29 08:51:29 Scotto 0 www.dosenation.com 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0000-00-00 00:00:00 1 0.00 0.00 0 5 2008-08-01 18:07:54

2270 34 jame465cdc3b2e707 blog.oregonlive.com Oregon high schoolers highest of all A recent study from the Oregon Department of Health and Services (DHS) has some interesting news about the drug habits of Oregonians, which are reprinted below:

<blockquote>Oregonians consume more alcohol than the national average, live in a state that ranks fourth nationwide for alcohol-related deaths, and have a drug-mortality rate that's been double the U.S. average for five years in a row. 

And the state is not just grappling with overintoxicated adults. The data show that Oregon eighth- and 11th-graders are more likely to smoke marijuana than smoke cigarettes, and the percentage of eighth-graders who said they drank alcohol in the previous 30 days was 76 percent higher than the national average. </blockquote>

Well, all I can say is this people: If we can get Oregon tweens and teens to turn away from big tobacco and start supporting local hemp, then we're doing something right here. Give yourselves all a high five. This is a moral victory for indie drug culture. The kids of Oregon have spoken; big tobacco is out.

120 1918 129 papalaterreur 2007-04-21 19:10:51 Mystical...atheist...spiritual...scientist...so many words...
The entheogen experience is highly inneffable and trying to put it in words is out of reach.
I personally encountered Jeremy (a french canadian, like me, who is now in switzerland) and Benny in Basel LSD event, back in january 2006 and I can say, from my personnal feeling, that Jeremy is a lot more 'spiritual' type of man than Benny. 
Benny, a VERY rational mind, is a university teacher and his approach  
is simple...take it, compile a lot of experiences, and write...draw the cartography of the Ayahuasca 'territory'..and, then...try to explain the Experience.
It can be a wonderful and very rewarding adventure but, from my point of view, the Jeremy's  approach,although it is more 'scientific' in his essence,  provides a radically new, and refreshing, vision of the entheogen phenomena. It can shed light on A LOT of insight experienced by generations of fellow psychonauts around the globe. 
Both books are eminently interesting but very differents. Benny's one is a lot more hard to read and gives a complete visit of the 'territory'.
Jeremy's book is short (+- 160 pages) and present a THEORY surrounding the entheogen phenomena...
Personally, I think that his theory is right in the 'bull's eye'...simply because it is...simple and elegant!
Moreover, it put a bridge between biology(dna), photonic (light and the relativity theory)), mythology (the double-serpent as THE FIRST LOGO OF HUMANITY), evolution (the presence of DMT in the pineal gland) and so on..
It is simply TOO NICE!!!
Life is SACRED. It is a GIFT.
The Entheogen Experience is Sacred and will, forever, remain a Mystery. Like it or not.
Jeremy's theory show the way to look at. Light, knowledge and consciousness are intrisically interwoven and leads to the birth of what we called 'REALITY' and LIFE gives us, through the DNA vector, the opportunity to be...ALIVE AND CONSCIOUS.
We are all GOD....but most of us do not remember it.
The entheogen experience is precisely there to remember it to each one who wish to. And Ayahuasca is probably the most 'pure' of all the different types of entheogens.

As in our visual cortex is 'picking something up" that it wouldn't normally, and it doesn't come via the eyes?  What is exactly is a 'photonic resonance'?

552 3335 64 Aumdoc 2007-10-02 07:30:19 I have experience administering atropine/scopolamine injections for nicotine addiction.  I took the job at the clinic two days a month to make some additional income.  I found out about the clinic because my dear friend, S, was successful quitting smoking through the clinic.  I had watched S literally torment himself for 2 years trying to quit smoking.  Every method he could try he did... patches, zyban, coldturkey... all without success.  It wasn't really his trying to quit that got to me, it was more the self recrimination when he failed.

S has quite an interest in plants, especially those with a history of psychotropic human interaction.  Among the many cactii on his back deck there are many tree datura's in pots with beautiful trumpet flowers.  He loves those plants.  To both him and I it seems no small coincidence that he ended up quitting using alkaloids found in these plants (and others as well, brugmansia & jimson weed come to mind).  He was assisted by his plant allies.

Whenever one reads about "recreational (!?!)" use of these plants on erowid, the reports almost always end with uncontrolled bizarre behavior that usually calls the attention of authorities.  Dosing from the plant source is very unpredictable and overdosing seems common with trouble that follows.  These plants are used in indiginous shamanic settings as admixtures in ayahuasca or smoking mixtures.  I think the indiginous shamans have a better handle on how to use them than the average American drug user.

I was so impressed by S's success that when I needed a few days extra work each month I contacted the clinic.  Now S kids me about shooting 'Datura Darts'.  In this therapy the individual is screened medically (history and physical, ekg, pulmonary function tests) to make sure they are a safe candidate for the therapy.  They then receive injection therapy, with specific weight based doses of atropine and scopolamine, to provide anticholinergic effects on nicotine receptors.  Once processed through the clinic (they watch video's and receive behavioral counseling) they continue scopolamine and atropine orally for 2 weeks.

We discuss that these are not new medications and have been and are used in many different ways in medicine.

Patients routinely have a 'big experience' with the shots.... meaning the feel something..... ("ooooooooooooo this must be powerful medicine if it makes me feel this way")... I can't help but feel this has something to do with the effectiveness of the method.  I tell people what to expect from the shots...." you may feel dizzy or lightheaded and off balance; your pupils will dilate making lights bright and it difficult to focus (like coming out of the eye doctors); you will have a very dry mouth; it is most common for people to be sedated and fall asleep on the ride home; it is very common for people to describe feeling stoned, drunk or intoxicated.  Some people like it and some don't.  Often times people look drunk as they walk out of the clinic.

I have been doing this since march, 2 days a month, and am amazed at how many people stop smoking who have been unable to do so over a lifetime.  I do not have this years numbers yet (success rates from the clinics follow up) but feel it will be more than 50%.  People describe a loss of craving immediately.  This is a clinic situation who will take anyone who pays and passes the medical screening.  I don't think all these people are really ready to quit and I feel that is an important part of success.  With establishment of more clear screening guidelines I think it would be even more effective.

The effects are very predictable using the weight based dosing schedule.  I have not had any problems with psychotropic or other medical adverse reactions.  Yes, some people have some 'unusual' experiencI as they describe to me, but nothing untoward.  Older individuals (>60 y/o) also seem to tolerate the treatment.

I have spent six months connecting to the Datura's in my yard and spending time using plant material at very very low dose to try to further connect with the beneficial effects of Datura Darts.  I always comment to patients that these are not new medicine's and in fact the plants these chemicals come from were used as medicine long before there were doctors.

556 3350 193 sean 2007-10-02 15:43:31 This comment might meander...but then, no one is really obligated to read on, anyway. I feel that this situation will get worse and worse and worse until people wake up to the real issues, on both sides of the problem. I mean to say, until people realize the truth about Altered States and the truth about the Drug War...and I'm not putting any label on those "truths", simply saying that it is NOT where we're at now. Some people are making solid definitions that are based on morality, reasoning and experience (which is the apex of importance in this case, and so often the crux of misunderstanding...this brings forth my "favorite" adjunct to the Drug War: people who've never had any experience with Altered States, labeling the nature and the safety of these states...), but the overarching social trends and this "War on Drugs" we find ourselves within seems to be pretty mindless, fear based and engendered by controlling and manipulative individuals/organizations. I live in Canada, and like most Countries (I would assume all Countries which impose such Drug Laws wear this fa??ade...), my Government assumes to tell me that the Drug Laws they impose are STRICTLY for my safety. They have only my best interests in mind, and they wouldn't want me to expose myself to something potentially dangerous. That's very nice of them, you know? There are many daaaangerous things out there, and I just can't imagine what would happen if I were left to my own devices. If you'd like to believe that Fairy-Tale and accept that this is what they truly design when contemplating Drug Scheduling, then we're faced with a very serious inconsistency. It's so obvious that I'm sure we've all recognized it, but it's such a great example of the true intentions, and therefore the rhetorical and practical hypocrisy, behind Drug Scheduling and Governmental control of a Populations exposure to Altered States that I have to bring it up. If our safety is of the utmost import, why can I so readily walk to any Gas Station, Corner Store, Supermarket and any other variety of places, and buy a 25 pack of pre-rolled, chemically-treated Tobacco cigarettes? I know this is a really touchy subject, and I'm not talking about removing any persons "right" to buy a pack of cigarettes, or to access the plants and plant products (or chemical substances, or what-have-you, you know fill in the blank, haha) of their choice, I'm just talking about the skin-and-bones logic behind the fact that Tobacco, in it's current market offering of the "Machine Processed Cigarette" is legal and taxed, whereas MANY substances which have measurably lower toxicity and health risks (and when I say measurably, I really mean that this isn't even the same game we're playing...the sort of health risks associated with cigarettes are so direct and so Bodily...) are not only Scheduled, but sought out and destroyed, their advocates either forced into hiding their passion or paying for it by serving out time in Prison. So no matter what you want to say about the health risks of other plants and substances, there is this very obvious contradiction of Tobacco being so studied and well understood as being toxic and damaging yet still being legal...especially when you compare that sort of toxicity with some of the plants or substances which are Scheduled. 

Take Psilocybin mushrooms, for instance. By and large the toxicity of Psilocybin mushrooms, and certainly the toxicity of Psilocybin or Psilocin themselves, is really non-existent. What I mean is that the body load, the damage induced by processing the chemicals and the long term stress on your system (not to mention the LACK of Cancer causing agents...) is astronomically lower with Psilocybin mushrooms than with Tobacco. Yet if you were to endeavor, even once, to imbibe just a single Psilocybin mushroom, and even if you were filled with moral, reasonable or perhaps spiritual intention, and approached the situation with the utmost respect and openness for what the Altered State might present to you, you are invariably considered a criminal. The context is therefore not important, not whatsoever. I'm not saying this new Altered State (the example of the Psilocybin mushroom) is without dangers...what we have to admit is that everything has some potential for harm and once you acknowledge this, you invariably begin approaching things with respect. Isn't that healthier? Respect, not fear...just respect. Understanding how something might affect you, what you're opening yourself up to, and how you can go about it with the most caution and safety, if it is indeed something you must do at all...in my opinion, this attitude is miles away from one built on fear and out of habit, without personal knowledge but merely based on social pre-definition of these States and Substances. So, yes, Psilocybin surely would carry its own set of dangers, but in my strong yet hopefully humble opinion, when they are held up to the set of dangers which Tobacco (esp. in the Modern preparation) carries, the notion that these Schedules are "strictly for our safety" is truly laughable. Well, it would be if it weren't such a terrible reality, causing so much suffering. It's the most incredibly ironic situation, so much that it might be funny if it weren't so unbelievably awful and tragic. The ruling Western mentality is one dominated by the obsession with verifiable evidence, of Science (the narrow branch of scientific thought which both depends and insists on measurability and "empirical" evidence). Within this thought system, some great minds in many (especially, obviously, Medical) fields that take up this obsession with measuring datum and performing experiments and so forth give very convincing arguments that Tobacco, especially delivered in such a convenient, easy to inhale, and chemically-treated formula, is incredibly dangerous, and DOES increase the likelihood of Cancer and does degenerate your body and does cause an incredibly strong, physical, mental, and I would certainly argue social/cultural addiction. So...you know, it's all so mind baffling that I feel myself losing steam, just thinking about this. All that I can hold on to is that it's simply not possible that the Government is only looking out for my best interests. If that were true, hey, maybe they still wouldn't let me access some of the things I would like to be able to access safely and legally, and that's not good news, but IF it were true then we wouldn't see this inequity that we clearly (or at least I clearly) do see. I don't want Tobacco to be struck down, made illegal and removed from the hands of people. I want honesty, and I think that's all that we can hope for. This Drug War is nothing but suppression, we have yet to deal with the true nature and importance of Altered States in our Modern, "civilized" culture and we externalize our suppression of these issues by fighting against them physically...but that will never, ever make this go away. That's not where the problem is; it's not in the plants or the substances themselves. The problem is the attitudes that surround them, the contexts which they have been forced into by legislation, historical misconception (often judgments about other cultures integration of and focus upon Altered States have been made through Racist, Colonial, Superiority Complex based perspectives) and social propaganda which is as unflagging as the outward violent attempts at drug and populace control which we label "The Drug War". 

The way I often rationalize this situation is to look at our culture as a comprehensive Being, and therefore to envision the Drug War as an element or a consequence of that Being and it's actions and values. This helps me to fathom how we can attempt to understand the Drug War and what we're doing by enacting these cultural values (or perhaps simply allowing them to be enacted upon us, either way...). For one thing, we can then assume that this is not something frivolous. If the experience of Altered States were something frivolous, it would not have the sort of historical ties with Humanity and the type of broad social currency which it has and does, all across the World and throughout Time. So whether it's something good, bad, or neutral, it is not merely an inconsequential thing...we should be examining it seriously, no matter what our personal opinions. This war is not a serious examination, it is, as I said, a form of suppression. With the Being analogy of culture then this Drug War could actually be seen as a type of repression of Shadow Material. Instead of confronting Altered States we combat them, so we don't have to acknowledge them and start looking at the questions and complications that these states suggest. Therefore, like Shadow Material, the problem of Altered States will not disappear with repression, rather it will gain weight and ferocity in the depths of the it's dark exile, continually growing and becoming expressed with more violence and fear until it is finally acknowledged, and dealt with rationally and honestly. So, yes, it can get worse. It most likely will get worse...but the possibility is there that someday maybe enough people will open themselves up to searching for what is honest and truly felt rather than simply accepting what is, upon inspection, nothing but a maniacal suppression of an inevitable conflict.

The first was a bottle-rocket (or thrown explosive) that detonated right over my head while watching a small burn (not the man). Hot paper and packing scalded my cheek and I was almost deaf in my right ear for two days. The second was a signal flare that was fired into the air from a quarter mile away and came down on my friend and I as we strolled the Esplanade. I dove for cover, but my friend took a burning flare right in the chest, causing a nice big second-degree burn under his nipple. Yes, Burning Man can be dangerous.

Pinchbeck has about the same stratospheric odiousness level as GWB as far as I'm concerned, and I'm hoping to see some other name get out there as the go-to for mainstream reporters on the subject of psychedelics and especially ayahuasca.   Unfortunately, no one's as tied in to the mechanics of marketing oneself quite like he is.    Grrrr.

Ayahuasca does have a golden reputation in the press, but that is easy to ruin.  What has kept that reputation solid for the most part is how it's used now - in a circle, with at least a modicum of introspection, and usually someone with a decent amount of experience steering the boat.  I doubt there's anything intrinsic in the drug that's keeping the reputation so good (although I'm open to convincing on this).   

The question isn't "Will ayahuasca become mainstream", it's more "Can we keep cultures, individuals, and economics from getting trashed as it becomes more hip?" 0 24.62.239.164 1

I've thought about this a bit and have come to a couple of conclusions. First of all, the inclusion of harmine and harmaline in the brew makes the user sleepy and prone to lying down and having waking dreams instead of dancing all night and/or running naked out into traffic; it's more "gentle" and predictable which makes it more savory to academics and advocates. Secondly, the fact that it tastes like pig's bile and makes you puke like a fire-hose makes it fairly immune to recreational abuse, thus strengthening its "good medicine" mystique. Thirdly, because it has been adopted into traditional and syncretic religious ceremonies and the Supreme Court can't touch it, advocates love to fawn all over it as the most "spiritual" psychedelic, and we all know that in drug code "spiritual" = "good". And finally, no one has dosed on ayahuasca and jumped out of a window and/or accidentally murdered someone yet (though you all know it is probably coming one of these days). Until that day the brew gets a free ride from the press. 0 66.235.37.130 1

I have occasional kidney stones, and the ER docs really push the oxy and hydro for that, so I always have a few half empty bottles lying around, put an anxiety disorder on top of that bam you've got the benzos, all legitimately prescribed by responsible doctors.

1120 4178 117 magicbean 2008-02-09 15:01:14 I buy your first reason wholesale.   Folks ain't going far.   Or fast.

Second reason, meh...many recreational drugs have ghastly unpleasant side effects or dosing methods.   It's a subjective thing and trainable, what we'll put up with, no?  Puke or stick a needle in your arm, which is more unpleasant?

Third reason, I'll buy that too, with comment.   I see the free press pass for Ayahuasca as a good thing, because that free ride might hook other stuff along with it.  If A is acceptable, then its equivalent B, previously assumed to be completely unacceptable, might make progress back towards OK.   The longer it stays a press virgin, the better all around.

2234 4681 74 avicenna 2008-05-14 22:30:49 Zupakomputer: Funny, you should ask. Slate has a column called "The Green Lantern" which takes (generally totally inane) questions like "Is concentrated orange juice better for the environment than fresh squeezed?" and gives them genuinely interesting answers that all boil down to "Well, it depends..." Now, I'm not a fan of trying to reduce highly multidimensional ideas like "good for the environment" into a one dimensional scale with "good" on one end and "bad" on the other, so it's kind of a guilty pleasure read for me, but I like that it's honest enough to always say "Well, it depends..." Anyway, just especially for our little discussion, this week it takes on lawn maintenance. Here it is:

http://www.slate.com/id/2191200/

Now, it mostly compares regular lawn maintainence to artificial turf, but the basic ideas are there. Another thing to note is that in making these comparisons, it is really only meaningful to compare something to an alternative which is a reasonable substitute for the activity/product in question. Thus, the cocaine analysis compares it to coffee, which I gave them a little grief over whether it is comparable.

tomk, loco: Yes, there are exceptions, and my friend whom I quoted actually mentioned a few: organic beer and wine, sunlight grown organic pot, and a couple more. Shrooms were probably on the list.

We would drink a bottle of robotussin, have a stomach ache for about 30 minutes and then go crazy for a few hours. One day I accidentally drank two bottles. I say accidentally because it started out as a sip out of the second bottle then another then a gulp until it was gone. After finishing that second bottle I realized I might have made a mistake. Then I proceeded to try and fit under the fridge. In all honesty it looked like the fridge was 3 feet off the ground. After telling everone "I COULD fit under the fridge I just don't have the energy right now" I flopped up the stairs. I went into my ex-girlfriends room and start yelling " Can someone please help that cat at the end of the bed. THere was no cat I was told the next day. Then the freaky stuff started. I don't remember much, but I was told I was shaking and talking giberish but looked like I was having the time of my life, so that is good. Of what I do remember there are many snapshots of the night. THe ceiling being pressed against my nose while laying in a bed 2 feet off the ground, and random flashes of color and motion. All in all I THINK I had fun. I met alot of new people as i found out the next couple of weeks. " Hey you where the guy trying to fit under the fridge" or " hey did you ever catch that cat" . 

Unfortunatlly you can not do this anymore. The Robotussen company has stopped making the extra strength cough formula, well they still make it but different ingredients. The DXM was removed from it.
