The control functions to loop audio (F2h) and stop audio play (FEh) do not work in one-line serial mode, though the documentation states they should.

Three-line serial mode operates with a 40 microsec to 2 msec clock cycle; much faster than one-line. The Waytronic documentation does not state explicitly, but various examples suggest that 600 microseconds is the minimum time required per data bit, and a signalling rate of 600-2000 microseconds is cited on their web site.

One can switch out of three line mode temporarily to use these pins as standard I/O - though I don't see at this time how you'd use such functionality.

Finally, one-line mode draws a minimum 5 mA current even when not playing, it does not go into sleep mode. Three-line serial mode draws 10 uA in sleep mode. 0 1 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/50.0.2661.102 Safari/537.36 0 1

I have discover one problem with WT588D-U.
The module is connected to 3.3 V microprocessor using 3 lines mode. Reset line is also connected and used.
If I switch off\on the device quickly (1-10 sec) - module does not work.
If I wait for approx. 30 sec - it works OK.

I tested 4 modules - they are absolutely the same.

Do you have that trouble in your design? 0 1 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko 0 0

but there is no "MP3 mode"(opertation -&gt; option).

I want to download the mp3 files and play them 
can you help me?

unfortunately, the WT588 documentation, and their marketing material, is vague and misleading. Version 1.6 of the software does not support MP3 files. It will *only* play WAV files. MP3s have to be re-encoded as I show in the article. Their "MP3 mode" is for basic MP3-player-like functionality - not MP3 files.

Apparently version 1.0 *did* support MP3 files as is, but I have not experimented with this/verified it directly. You may be able to find it on the internet. I wish you luck.

hope this helps,

First very helpful - many thanks.
Question - did you find any instructions/schematic for the programmer?  I have the same one as your picture above.  It has a speaker connection and buttons for the keys and hence looks like it should be able to be used to test boards just after programming and before soldering into the end device.  I also note it has a header with CS, DI, DO, CLK etc that looks like it could be connected to a final device to program/re-program a module in its final device - again potentially useful.
Any help much appreciated.

95 1 2016-04-11 00:16:41 2016-04-11 00:16:41 I won't pretend that this is an exciting video - but here is my <a href="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/project-bike-trainer-computer-using-the-digispark-pro/">bike trainer computer</a> in action. It works.

[video width="720" height="400" m4v="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/00128-1-1.m4v"][/video]

&nbsp;

Hardware: Arduino 1.77" TFT LCD Display 160x128, two reed switches (coulda used Hall effect sensors, and I might at a later date), and two 10K pull-down resistors.

Initially, I relied on a simple loop to poll the wheel and pedal sensors. Bad mistake. Many wheel and pedal rotations were missed, even with a 10 microsecond delay, presumably as the processor chewed on math routines. The new IRQ version uses interrupts on two discrete pins to track rotations - not as simple on the Digispark Pro as it seemed, intially, but the TinyPinChange library made it possible.

The Digispark Pro is also limited by a rather small amount of memory. 512 bytes of dynamic RAM, less of which is available at run-time (the compiler is terrible at estimating how much you have left!) and 14,844 bytes available for program code. 

Challenging.

I've had to forgo the available string-handling routines - dtostrf or String() add 2 kb and 3.5 kb to compiled code, respectively. Instead I used a six-character array to write text to screen. The same function blanks previous text by writing an extended ASCII code 219 character (block, or ?) in black over the previous text. To further conserve program space, I truncated GLCDFONT.C at 'z', or character 123, and remapped ASCII character 219 to character code 1.

Below, the code, with one modification from the version in the video: watts and calories now displayed with up to four digits, i.e. allowing for workouts and power outputs greater than 1000.

8 1 2016-02-10 00:08:11 2016-02-10 00:08:11 I've been toying with the idea of building some custom microprocessor-based electronics projects, but have always been a cheapskate. Plus, while I like challenges, I also like knowing that what I have in mind is achievable.

When I saw the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digistump/digispark-pro-tiny-arduino-ready-mobile-and-usb-de">Digispark Pro</a> on Kickstarter, an Arduino-compatible processor for $14, I was intrigued. It was small but mighty, featured a 16 Mhz AVR processor, 16KB flash memory, 14 I/O pins, and compatibility with all sorts of external devices. And I had a project in mind: a bike computer I could use on my trainer. Sure, I have one, but it doesn't tell me what kind of work I'm doing on the trainer, or how many calories I've burned. And that kind of feedback can keep me motivated, on those long winter months when I can only ride on a trainer.

<a href="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/4ec9516ff5c925e7a22c151c7992a028_original.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-9"><img class="wp-image-9 aligncenter" src="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/4ec9516ff5c925e7a22c151c7992a028_original-300x218.jpg" alt="4ec9516ff5c925e7a22c151c7992a028_original" width="609" height="443" /></a>

So I've got it, and now I wish I'd ordered more than just the one. Fun little item. Quite powerful, as well.

Did it work? Brilliantly. The bike computer is pretty much built - subject for another post. Of course, it requires ongoing revisions and tweaking, and I'm already thinking of bigger and better.

Which leads me to Eric Kettenburg's next project, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digistump/oak-by-digistump-wi-fi-for-all-things-arduino-comp/description">Digistump Oak.</a> Some specs:

13 1 2016-02-10 00:25:14 2016-02-10 00:25:14 I've been toying with the idea of building some custom microprocessor-based electronics projects, but have always been a cheapskate. Plus, while I like challenges, I also like knowing that what I have in mind is achievable.

When I saw the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digistump/digispark-pro-tiny-arduino-ready-mobile-and-usb-de">Digispark Pro</a> on Kickstarter, an Arduino-compatible processor for $14, I was intrigued. It was small but mighty, featured a 16 Mhz AVR processor, 6KB flash memory, 14 I/O pins, and compatibility with all sorts of external devices. And I had a project in mind: a bike computer I could use on my trainer. Sure, I have one, but it doesn't tell me what kind of work I'm doing on the trainer, or how many calories I've burned. And that kind of feedback can keep me motivated, on those long winter months when I can only ride on a trainer.

<a href="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/4ec9516ff5c925e7a22c151c7992a028_original.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-9"><img class="wp-image-9 aligncenter" src="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/4ec9516ff5c925e7a22c151c7992a028_original-300x218.jpg" alt="4ec9516ff5c925e7a22c151c7992a028_original" width="609" height="443" /></a>

So I've got it, and now I wish I'd ordered more than just the one. Fun little item. Quite powerful, as well.

Did it work? Brilliantly. The bike computer is pretty much built - subject for another post. Of course, it requires ongoing revisions and tweaking, and I'm already thinking of bigger and better.

Which leads me to Eric Kettenburg's next project, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digistump/oak-by-digistump-wi-fi-for-all-things-arduino-comp/description">Digistump Oak.</a> Some specs:

107 1 2016-04-20 00:24:24 2016-04-20 00:24:24 Need to add sound to your project? Voice prompts? Sound effects in games? Robots that bleep or boop or scream? Talking alarm systems?

The WT588D, a so-called 'voice chip', allows you to add custom sound clips in the form of WAV files to your project, and is available for a few dollars on eBay. Drive a tiny 0.5W, 8-ohm speaker directly, or run the output to an amplifier circuit.

Unfortunately, the documentation is awfully cryptic, and the software and WAV file requirements are quirky.

A few variants: the small-and-cute 16-pin or WT588D-16p version, typically sold with 8 Mbit (1 MB) flash memory for file storage:

<a href="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WT588D-16.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-108"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-108" src="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WT588D-16.jpg" alt="WT588D-16" width="500" height="500" /></a>

is the one I'll be posting about. It's the smallest and most portable. That said, it requires a separate programming module that typically runs around $10, also on eBay.

<a href="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wt588d-programmer.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-110"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-110" src="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wt588d-programmer.jpg" alt="wt588d programmer" width="500" height="355" /></a>
The 28-pin WT588D-28p variety costs only a dollar or so more, and is frequently sold with 32 Mbit (4 MB) memory.  Like the WT588-16p, it can only be updated via the programming module. It's also considerably larger, and can be hard to find, likely because the WT588D-U runs at about the same size and price.

The last version is the WT588D-U, which supports programming and data transfer by its mini-USB connector (no external module required), and again, typically comes with 32 Mbit of on-board flash memory.

Specs: the WT588D boasts a fast DSP audio processor, 12-bit PWM output, and good sound quality - though this is harder to judge with the tiny little speakers it drives, and I haven't as yet amplified it sufficiently to judge better. Sampling rates range from 6-22 kHz. When no file is playing, sleep mode activates automatically, and draws under 10 ?A. Operating voltage is 2.8-5.5 V.

So: the quirks. First, the software ...

You can't just open the software and load WAV files. While there's nothing difficult here, it may also not seem obvious that you need to click on File to start a New Project:

<a href="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wt588d-programmer1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-113"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-113" src="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wt588d-programmer1.png" alt="wt588d programmer1" width="445" height="282" /></a>

Name it something. Note that lower-case c, e, s and w don't work. Upper-case letters do. Your software isn't corrupt - it's working properly. Presumably one of the vagaries of adapting the software from Chinese.

On the right, select your chip's memory size under Flash. Note that regardless of what you specify, the software will let you add sound files that exceed the available space without warning. You'll need to keep track.

To load sound files, you'll right click on the main file window and select Load.

<a href="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wt588d-programmer2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-114"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114" src="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wt588d-programmer2.png" alt="wt588d programmer2" width="419" height="310" /></a>

Select your sound files. And very likely you'll get an Inappropriate sampling rate! error. Sigh.

This chip's finicky. It will accept files sampled at 6,000 to 20,000 Hz, in 2,000 Hz increments - exactly. Nothing else. Unfortunately, there are very few WAVs recorded at these sampling rates. You'll need to resample.

Resample to the lowest rate that gives you acceptable audio, in order to save on file size. WAV files are uncompressed audio, and a 10-second clip in 44.1 kHz stereo will run about 1,723 kB in size. Remember - the smaller chip holds 8 Mbit, not MB! This little puppy - even with some basic built-in compression - wouldn't hold more than about 15 secs of high-fidelity audio - if it were capable.

According to play-times cited in the official documentation, you should be able to store about three times the actual WAV file sizes for the amount of available memory. Given a maximum sampling rate of 22,000 kHz, you could store about 40 seconds' worth of mono, 22,000 kHz audio on an 8 Mbit chip, about half that for stereo. Your mileage may vary.

Simply converting to a different rate can distort the WAV file into garbage. Best way to convert - <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>.

Load Audacity, and load up your audio files.

Highlight your selection, and click on Tracks, then Stereo Tracks to Mono - since your WT588D output is mono, anyway. File is now half its original size.

Then, at the bottom of the Audacity screen, specify your desired sampling rate. For music, you might accept 16000 or 14000 kHz, or less - and for some sounds, even 6000 kHz may be acceptable.

<a href="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/audacity1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-118" src="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/audacity1.png" alt="audacity1" width="251" height="96" /></a>

after which you select File, Export Audio, then WAV.

I tend to resample files to different rates, than pick the smallest that still sounds appropriate for my application.

Back to the WT588D VoiceChip software. Load your files once again. The status bar at the bottom of the program will tell you how much of your flash memory will be used by your files - provided you've indicated the correct size of flash memory in the program. This value is not saved and so will have to be re-entered every time you run the program.

Once you're happy, you need to bind audio files to 'Equations', or numeric values used to trigger those files. Select your Equation number, then double-click on the sound file(s) you want in the left panel, in the order in which you want them played when that key is triggered.

<a href="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wt588d-programmer4-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-142" src="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wt588d-programmer4-1.png" alt="wt588d programmer4" width="780" height="232" /></a>

Note that any grouped files will play back-to-back, without pause, when triggered. If you want pauses between files, you do so by right-clicking in the right panel and selecting Insert, then either a pre-defined silence duration, or you define your own.

<a href="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wt588d-programmer5.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-143" src="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wt588d-programmer5.png" alt="wt588d programmer5" width="335" height="307" /></a>

Once you've configured your various audio file sequences, it's time to specify what mode you will use to access your sound files. Click on Mode, and select.

Options:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>MP3 mode</td>
<td>pretty limited mode, allows only STOP, ON/OFF, NEXT, PREV, VOL+, and VOL- as control options. Please note: version 1.6 of this software does not actually support MP3 files, just an MP3-player-like mode</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Key mode (default)</td>
<td>play a specific sound sequence or playlist by pressing a specific key. You bind each Equation to a specific pin; activate by pressing a switch that pulls it low to ground. For a 16-pin module, only pins P00 to P03 are available; version 1.2 of the 28-pin module defines another six pins, or up to four discrete key-mapped sound sequences, or ten, respectively</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One-line serial</td>
<td>use one serial line to communicate with the chip, or activate sequences using specific pins as in Key mode. Can apparently be hard to get working</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Three-line serial</td>
<td>uses three pins for CS, DATA, SCK for an SPI-style control interface. Commonly used</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Parallel</td>
<td>a parallel interface with fewer control options - and for an 16-pin module, only 3 pins are available to specify 2<sup>3</sup> equation addresses, or a maximum of 8 sound sequences</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3x8 Matrix</td>
<td>play one of 24 equation lists by a combination of input on pins P00-P07 and P10-P12. No controls available, and requires 11 pins just to trigger sounds - so not even an option on a 16-pin module. Very limited</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
As to the various ways sounds can be triggered, repeated, stopped - details are in the WT588D CHIP&amp;MODULE DETAILED INFORMATION pdf file. The translations are clumsy (and in places not accurate) but the diagrams should help you figure these out.

If using specific keys i.e. triggering sounds via specific input pins, you may want to specify which function and equation should bind to each key, under Operation. Note that the defaults work nicely for four inputs/four sound sequences.

Oh, and this may on occasion throw an error of the 'File was not found' variety. Don't worry about it. Another quirk. Just try it again.

This chip's finicky. It will accept files sampled at 6,000 to 20,000 Hz, in 2,000 Hz increments - exactly. Nothing else. Unfortunately, there are very few WAVs recorded at these sampling rate. You'll need to resample.

Simply converting to a different rate can distort the WAV file into garbage. Best way to convert - <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>.

116 1 2016-04-19 00:22:33 2016-04-19 00:22:33 Need to add sound to your Arduino? Voice prompts? Talking alarm systems?

The WT588D, a so-called 'voice chip', allows you to add custom sounds in the form of WAV files to your project, and is available for a few dollars on eBay. Drive a tiny 0.5W, 8-ohm speaker directly, or run the output to an amplifier circuit.

Unfortunately, the documentation is awfully cryptic, and the software and WAV file requirements are quirky.

A few variants: the small-and-cute 16-pin version, typically sold with 8 Mbit (1 MB) flash memory for file storage:<a href="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WT588D-16.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-108"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-108" src="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WT588D-16.jpg" alt="WT588D-16" width="500" height="500" /></a>

is the one I'll be posting about. It's the smallest and most portable. Both the 16-pin and 28-pin versions also require a separate programming module that typically runs around $10, also on eBay.

<a href="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wt588d-programmer.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-110"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-110" src="http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wt588d-programmer.jpg" alt="wt588d programmer" width="500" height="355" /></a>
The 28-pin variety runs only a dollar or so more, and is frequently sold with 32 Mbit (4 MB) memory. It also supports data transfer by its mini-USB connector, whereas the WT588-16p can only be updated via the programming module. Finally, it's considerably larger.

Specs: the WT588D boasts a fast DSP audio processor, 12-bit PWM output, and good sound quality - though this is harder to judge with the tiny little speakers it drives, and I haven't as yet amplified it sufficiently to judge better. Sampling rates range from 6-22 kHz. When no file is playing, sleep mode activates automatically, and draws under 10 ?A. Operating voltage is 2.8-5.5 V.

32 2006-04-17 On WASM, and other assemblers ... prog, faves assembler, assembly language compiler, WASM, Wolfware Assembler, A86, NASM, MASM, Netwide Assembler Review of assembly-language compilers including WASM or Wolfware Assembler, MASM, A86, and the Netwide Assembler or NASM I paid $10 for the registered version of <strong>WASM</strong> - the Wolfware Assembler - over ten years ago: a bargain-basement price for what was an excellent assembler. In it, Erick Tauck ignored Borland's and Microsoft's insistence that models be declared, that files be LINKed, and the &quot;ptr&quot;, &quot;assume&quot;, and various other unnecessary complexities one shouldn't be bothered with: assembler's hard enough without them. Even better, <a href="http://dosonly.net/wasm223.zip">WASM version 2.23</a> is now available for free, courtesy of <a href="http://dosonly.net/">DOSOnly.Net</a>. <p /><p>The official spiel: &quot;Wolfware Assembler (WASM) is a free assembler for the 8086 and compatible microprocessors. WASM is best suited for writing system utilities, TSR's, and other small programs. The minimum system requirements are an IBM pC or compatible, 100K of free memory, and DOS 2.0 or up. The assembler package consists of the assembler program, the user's manual, a list of version changes, and sample programs. All of the documentation (*.TXT) files are standard text files that can be displayed on the screen or printed. Unmodified copies of WASM may be shared and distributed. WASM may be used without obligation to the author.&quot; </p><p>On the downside, WASM doesn't handle commands specific to the 386-or-higher. I don't know if that's changed, and don't care: good DOS programs can be produced using 8088 code alone - DOS versions of <a href="http://www.neosoftware.com/nb.html">NeoBook</a> and <a href="http://www.neosoftware.com/np.html">Neopaint</a>, both by <a href="http://www.neosoftware.com/index.html">NeoSoft</a>, are two very capable software programs that come to mind. NeoBook EXE files can be megabytes in size and run on an XT! With that in mind, I made it a point of pride that my DOS programs all run on the slowest IBM PC or compatible. </p><p>Freeware examples of programs encoded with WASM include my DOS programming utilities <a href="article.php?article=27">BIOS Reporter</a> and <a href="article.php?article=28">ScanCode Show</a> (both available with full source code), and the keypress-DOS TSR <a href="article.php?article=30">KeyCount</a>.</p><p><i>If, however, you're shopping for a more complex assembler</i>, one that'll do 386+ code, protected mode, Windows, MMX, SIMD and AMD's 3DNow instructions, consider Eric Isaacson's <a href="http://eji.com/index.htm"><b>A86</b></a>. More pricey, manual more voluminous, tightest and cleanest code, and this man also disdains the hoops Borland and Microsoft would have you jump through. IMHO the best DOS assembler around, and I say that even though my loyalties lie with WASM... </p><p><i>The most interesting and versatile</i>, is NASM, the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nasm/"><b>Netwide Assembler</b></a> - an open-source (i.e, free) 80x86 assembler designed for portability and modularity. It supports DOS, Linux and NetBSD/FreeBSD, a.out, ELF, COFF, Microsoft 16-bit OBJ and Win32, MMX, 3DNow!, SSE and SSE2 instructions, and has macro capability. For an assembler, it's relatively simple. It is continually being improved - currently undergoing intensive development - so be advised that it is a work in progress. Still, if I were actively programming assembler at present, it is the one I'd choose.</p><p>If I find the time, I'll probably post a few small example programs in this space, created with NASM, and with source code. Don't hold your breath.</p><p><i>As to the rest: </i>Intel's <b>MASM</b> is often cryptic, convoluted, bloated, internally self-contradictory, and strange, and runs only under DOS. Borland's Turbo Assembler <b>TASM</b> isn't as bad, but MASM compatibility makes for many of the same problems, and it's pricey. <b>gas</b> is free, but horrible. <b>as86</b> is Minix- and Linux-specific, and poorly-documented. <i>Programmer beware.</i> </p> prog progheaven
30 2006-03-17 KeyCount KeyCount - an ancient DOS TSR used to monitor keyboard activity free keyboard activity monitor, DOS TSR KeyCount v1.0 - DOS TSR used to monitor keyboard activity for security reasons, measuring productivity <p>One of my earliest freeware utilities (KeyCount dates from 1995), I've decided to leave it available to the general public for those few aberrant souls (sorry) that continue to use DOS in the days of far more capable operating systems. Why? Why not.</p><p>KeyCount, like my programs <a href="article.php?article=27">BIOS Reporter</a> and <a href="article.php?article=28">ScanCode Show</a>, was written in WASM, the Wolfware Assember by Eric Tauck. This assembler is now available free of charge, and it works well for small DOS-only projects, even those coded for the 8086 ... More on <a href="article.php?article=32">WASM, and other assemblers,</a> elsewhere.</p><p>I apologize that I haven't made the source code for this program publicly available - for the simple reason that I never annotated it, and I can barely decipher my own code at this point in time. Were I to re-develop the program, I'd start from scratch. While modern languages are better structured and much easier to read, the lesson remains: <em>annotate your code!</em></p><p>KeyCount records the number of key-presses made at the keyboard, after the program is either invoked from the command line, or by a special key-stroke combination.  When this same key-stroke combination is used again, the logged number of keypresses is displayed.  This makes it useful for security purposes:  has anyone else accessed the system in the meanwhile?  or to measure productivity:  has an employee done any typing at all, and if so, how many characters have been entered in your absence?</p><p>KeyCount is a TSR (Terminate-and-Stay-Resident) type program, that loads into memory when the program is invoked.  It takes up 784 bytes (less than 1 KB) of your precious memory, and may be loaded high. (Nostalgic for those old days, anyone? EMM386 and HIMEM.SYS?)</p><p>Only a maximum of 655359 key-strokes is recorded; the counter then returns to zero.  This shouldn't alarm anyone, as even a relay team of highly skilled typists working non-stop for 24 hours shouldn't exceed this character count.</p><p>Download the program from <a href="http://freeware.ars-informatica.ca/dosutil.htm">http://freeware.ars-informatica.ca/dosutil.htm</a></p> prog progheaven

This happens server-side, i.e. on the web server, not on the viewer's system - the code is invisible to end users.</p><p>GD is written in C; versions are available for Perl, PHP and other languages.  PNG, JPEG and GIF images, including animated GIFs, can be produced. FreeType and TrueType text can be added, complex graphics drawn, most image conversions are handled fairly well.</p><p /><p>GD comes standard with <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP 4.3.x</a> and beyond. If your web hosts offers PHP scripting, you probably already have access to these image functions. GD is not as powerful as <a href="article.php?article=22">ImageMagick</a> (not even close), or as easy to use - but it easily exceeds most users' requirements. It does not require the PHP exec() function to run - a huge safety plus (though with MagickWand for PHP you can also avoid this problem, if your web hosting company is willing to install it for you).</p><p>Check <a href="http://www.php.net/">www.php.net</a> for all the details; the PHP manual doesn't reference gd functions in the index - but you'll find them all under 'Image Functions.'</p><p>If you run your own web server with PHP (version 4.3 or better), open php.ini and ensure that extension_dir points to the directory in which PHP is installed, i.e.</p><p /><pre class="code">extension_dir = &quot;c:/php/extensions&quot;</pre><p /><p>and enable gd by uncommenting the &quot;#extension=php_gd2.dll&quot; line in php.ini, i.e.</p><pre class="code"><p>extension = php_gd2.dll</p></pre><p>(You'll find both lines in the php.ini file, though in different locations.)</p><p>Because gd functions aren't the easiest to use, I present the ones I use as a series of articles here - download the code and use it straight, if you wish, or adapt it to your own needs.</p><p>Jeff Knight of New York PHP provides the <a href="http://nyphp.org/content/presentations/GDintro/">best tutorial I've found on the subject</a> - thorough, complete, and very easy to follow. Recommended.<br>

Several command-line examples provided <p><a title="ImageMagick" href="http://www.imagemagick.org/"><img alt="ImageMagick logo" hspace="15" src="content/imagemagick_logo.jpg" align="right" vspace="10" border="0" />ImageMagick</a> consists of a set of powerful, open-source (free!) routines used to create and edit bitmap images. These can be called directly by web pages, i.e. through the <a title="PHP home page" href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> exec() command, by batch programs, or any software you've written. Or incorporate the Magick via the appropriate interface for your platform, i.e. PerlMagick, Magick++ (C++), PythonMagick, MagickWand for PHP, RMagick (Ruby), TclMagick (Tcl/Tk), L_Magick, JMagick (Java), and others. It's available for all major operating systems.</p><p>ImageMagick reads, converts and writes images in over 90 formats, including GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PhotoCD, TIFF, and DPX. Crop, resize, stretch, or rotate; sharpen, reduce the number of colors in the palette, make the image transparent, or sepia-tone it. Merge images, or combine them into an animated GIF. Add text, lines, polygons, ellipses and B&eacute;zier curves.</p><p>One example - crop an X-ray to the area of interest, create a negative image, resize to maximum height and width of 200 pixels, and save as a JPEG at almost-lossless quality:</p><pre class="code"><p>convert -crop 570x740 -negate -resize 200x200 -quality 90 knee.jpg

Full source code is included, and may be freely modified and distributed. </p><p>Of course, nothing is perfect. The number of options are overwhelming, so much so that it's almost impossible to visualize the enormous range of possibilities these routines offer. Complex commands take a long time to craft. And my web hosting service no longer permits the PHP exec() command to be executed - this command opens the door for crackers: if they can upload one .php file, they can destroy your system. </p><p>Finally, because my web host hasn't installed MagickWand for PHP, I'm stuck using <a title="PHP home page" href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>'s gd graphics library - see the related <a href="article.php?article=23">Image creation and manipulation using the gd Graphics Library</a>.</p> graphics progheaven

For years, it was bundled with editions of Scott Mueller's <u>Upgrading and Repairing PCs</u> (<em>the</em> authoratative reference on this subject, currently in its 17th edition). Amazingly, some still find it useful, whether because they're still reading this data area using some programming language or other, or because they're learning assembler ...</p><p>BIOS Reporter actively reports much of the extensive, low-level system information available in the BIOS data area; in DOS, it can be run as a pop-up TSR to report changes to BIOS values while a second program is running.

MySQL, prog, webdev, free PHP, script, code, timer, execution, timing PHP Script Timer easily identifies PHP code bottlenecks - file operations, image manipulations, complex SQL queries, etc. - for you to fix, discard, or disregard. Code released under the GNU GPL <p>Code choking your server's CPU? Site visitors clicking away because your page is taking too long to respond? Do you know?</p><p>PHP typically executes very quickly, though some code just plods. Retrieving and parsing remote files, image manipulations, multiple complex SQL queries, can grind down your site. Use PHP Script Timer to identify your bottlenecks.</p><p>For example, you want to retrieve and parse a remote RSS news feed. Do you use a locally cached file copy if it's current enough? Do you not bother, and just use the remote feed each time? Does it matter?</p><p>Using my walRuSS.php RSS feed script, and a remote feed:</p><pre class="code">Script execution over 10 loops averages 1.55419661999 seconds<br />Fastest: 1.07788205147 seconds<br />Slowest: 3.7918651104 seconds</pre><p>Now, exact same script, exact same feed, but cached:</p><pre class="code"><p>Script execution over 10 loops averages 0.0444237470627 seconds<br />Fastest: 0.0355970859528 seconds<br />Slowest: 0.0772120952606 seconds</p></pre><p>Surprised? I was. And I use a local cache file rather than the remote feed, if the cache file is 'fresh' enough.</p><p>PHP Script Timer is short, simple, and very easy to use. First, reference the script:</p><pre class="code"><p>include 'PHP_script_timer.php';</p></pre><p>Next, call the timing script immediately before the code you wish to time:</p><pre class="code">$timing_loops = 1;<br />for ($current_loop = 0; $current_loop &lt; $timing_loops; $current_loop++) {<br />	$time_start = microtime_float();</pre><p>And at the end of the code you're timing:</p><pre class="code"><p>	$timing[] = microtime_float() - $time_start;<br />}<br />timing($timing);</p></pre><p>To run more the timing loop more then once, and calculate fastest, slowest and average execution times, simply specify 2 or more $timing_loops.</p><p>Customize your output further by changing the report_timing &lt;STYLE&gt; tag, or alter the HTML output code as you see fit.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>This PHP script is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, i.e. free for you to use, modify, and even redistribute under the terms of this license - see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a> for further details.</p><p><a title="PHP Script Timer source code" href="source.php?file=PHP_script_timer.php"><img style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: -10px" alt="magnifier icon" hspace="10" src="resources/magnifier.gif" align="left" border="0" /></a>view <a title="PHP Script Timer source code" href="source.php?file=PHP_script_timer.php">PHP Script Timer source code</a><br clear="all" /></p><p><a title="PHP Script Timer code and documentation" href="downloads/PHPtimer.zip"><img alt="download icon" hspace="10" src="resources/floppy.gif" align="left" border="0" /></a>download <a title="PHP Script Timer code and documentation" href="downloads/PHPtimer.zip">PHPtimer.zip</a> -<br />PHP Script Timer code and documentation</p><p /> PHP progheaven

12 4 2007-03-29 Google PageRank demystified: Practical tips to increasing your page's PageRank webdev increasing Google PageRank Practical tips for increasing Google PageRank In this, the first article of three, we describe Google's PageRank, what it is, how it works, and why you should care ...

<p>(In short, Google PageRank is the score Google assigns to each or your web site's pages, which in turn determines how likely Google is to return your site when someone searches for content featured on a given page.)

<p>PageRank is Google-specific, but techniques used to legitimately optimize your PageRank are relevant to other search engines as well: they all use algorithms to determine which sites on the Web are most important, and which pages are the most important on a given site. Making your site search-engine friendly, building it so you focus a search engine's weighting-of-importance where it should - this is Search Engine Optimization, or SEO.

<p>We show you how to logically implement your site, to provide best value for your visitors, and to optimize its PageRank. We do not cover SEO techniques intended to artificially inflate a site's PageRank - most major search engines now look for these practices and will blacklist or down-rank sites that use them. We <i>will</i> warn you if a coding practice is considered inappropriate.

<p>There are other articles on Google's PageRank, full of complex math and complicated modelling; we link to some of them. In this article, we explain the basic PageRank formula and demonstrate how incoming and outgoing links affect a page's rating. We describe how PageRank is affected by multiple-page sites and internal links, and also explain the logarithmic down-ranking of PageRank. <a href="article.php?article=4">[ And more ... ]</a></p> webdev

These can be called directly, i.e. by web pages, batch programs, software you're writing, or via the appropriate interface for your platform. ImageMagick is available for all major operating systems.</p><p>ImageMagick handles over 90 formats, including GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PhotoCD and TIFF. Crop, resize, stretch, rotate; sharpen, color-reduce your palette, make the image transparent, or sepia-tone it. Merge images or combine them into an animated GIF. Add text, lines, polygons, ellipses and B&#920;zier curves.</p><p>Of course, nothing is perfect. The number of options are overwhelming: it's almost impossible to visualize the enormous range of possibilities these routines offer. Complex commands take time to craft. And my web hosting service no longer permits the PHP exec() command - it can open the door for crackers. If they can upload one .php file, they can destroy your system.  <a href="article.php?article=22">[ Examples of ImageMagick usage, and full review ... ]</a> </p> graphics
24 32 2006-04-17 On WASM, and other assemblers ... prog, faves WASM assemblers WASM and other assemblers I paid $10 for the registered version of <strong>WASM</strong> - the Wolfware Assembler - a few years ago: a bargain-basement price for an excellent assembler. In it, Erick Tauck ignored Borland's and Microsoft's insistence that models be declared, that files be LINKed, and the &quot;ptr&quot;, &quot;assume&quot;, and various other unnecessary complexities one shouldn't be bothered with: assembler's hard enough without them. Even better, <a href="http://dosonly.net/wasm223.zip">WASM version 2.23</a> is now available for free, courtesy of <a href="http://dosonly.net/">DOSOnly.Net</a>. <p /><p><i>If, however, you're shopping for a more complex assembler</i>, one that'll do 386+ code, protected mode, Windows, MMX, SIMD and AMD's 3DNow instructions, consider Eric Isaacson's <a href="http://eji.com/index.htm"><b>A86</b></a>. More pricey, manual more voluminous, tightest and cleanest code, and this man also disdains the hoops Borland and Microsoft would have you jump through. IMHO the best DOS assembler around, and I say that even though my loyalties lie with WASM... </p><p><i>The most interesting and versatile</i>, is NASM, the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nasm/"><b>Netwide Assembler</b></a> - an open-source (i.e, free) 80x86 assembler designed for portability and modularity. It supports DOS, Linux and NetBSD/FreeBSD, a.out, ELF, COFF, Microsoft 16-bit OBJ and Win32, MMX, 3DNow!, SSE and SSE2 instructions, and has macro capability. For an assembler, it's relatively simple. It is continually being improved - currently undergoing intensive development - so be advised that it is a work in progress. Still, if I were actively programming assembler at present, it is the one I'd choose.  <a href="article.php?article=32">[ Read more ... ]</a> </p> prog

Malazan Book of the Fallen Steven Erikson 8.7 steven_erikson Steven Erikson, Malazan Book of the Fallen, Gardens of the Moon, Deadhouse Gates My new favourite author. Magnificent stuff - easily the best fantasy since <u>The Lord of the Rings</u>. Perhaps better; I can't make up my mind, since Erikson's <u>Malazan Book of the Fallen</u> is so utterly different from Tolkien. This fantasy cycle comprises ten volumes (one through seven already in print). Each book is brilliant, brutal, magnificent, and unpredictable; each stands alone, though the books are wonderfully interwoven.

<p><IMG SRC="resources/deadhouse_gates.jpg" align=right alt="Deadhouse Gates cover">
Erikson's prose hits hard: makes you wince, twists your gut. Makes you laugh, and leaves you silent. Empty.

<p>The writing is stark, driven, uncompromising. Morality is ambiguous, and betrayal the norm. No vicarious pleasure in the savage Seven Cities' uprising, in the Seer's starving legions - forced to devour the enemy, or die - or the slaughter of Coltaine's Chain of Dogs, and no shading of the truth. This world mirrors our own.

<p>Sorry, a fishergirl possessed by a psychopathic would-be god, leaves gory murders in her wake. Ganoes Paran betrays his Empress and his god, and would save the world. Kruppe the Magnificent: magnificent in dreams, in humour, in subterfuge, in irrefutable logic, and in his ability to stuff pastries. Felisin, ruined by <i>durhang</i> and sex and indifference, redeemed, vengeful. Whiskeyjack and his Bridgeburners, destined for death. Duiker, Imperial Historian, his endurance, courage, and loss without equal. Coltaine, Wickan chieftain, whose dying soul cannot be contained.

<p>Erikson does not spare his characters - they love and hate, triumph gloriously and are ripped apart, sometimes all in the same few breaths. He does not apologize for them, but his sympathy for even the most heinous of them is immense. 

<p>Erikson's world is intensely old: hundreds of thousands of years layered down in dirt and blood, bone and ash. Magic abounds, powerful, fickle stuff, none of it cheap. The warrens - currents of lifeblood for an Elder God - are assailed, treacherous. Dreams make for strange, alternate magic, and the magic of the Deck defies and limits the others. And as in our world, chance skews outcomes into unforeseen directions.

<p>Military campaigns are ugly, messy affairs, complex and treacherous and thoroughly believable. Cultures are brilliantly portrayed: through their pottery and art, slums and brothels, oral traditions and mythologies, garb and dialect, animal husbandry and the artistry of insults. Peoples and tribes, cities and villages, sects, religions, cultural and biological evolution are vivid and unique - our 'real' life but a dim reflection of Erikson's, to the last (vicious) lapdog. Not a single trite unmemorable charicature, or a single wasted detail - this world is real, grabs you, drags you along.

<p>Warning to the reader: if you want an easy read, nothing complicated or unpleasant, no moral ambiguities - stay clear. Erikson is not for you.

<p>For all others, Erikson gives us the richest, deepest fantasy world yet, stuffed brimful with flawed and tragic and exquisite characters, a driven plot, visceral prose, loss and redemption, humour, and great beauty. Highly recommended.

Song of Fire and Ice George R.R. Martin 8.0 george_rr_martin George R. R. Martin, Song of Ice and Fire, Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings, Storm of Swords, Feast for Crows <IMG SRC="resources/game_of_thrones.jpg" align=right alt="A Game of Thrones cover">
George R. R. Martin's <u>Song of Ice and Fire</u> is more sword than sworcery, heavy on death and betrayel and deep intrigue, believable and uncompromising - hard-core fantasy. And it's more honest than most. Characters are solid, competent, sometimes wildly unpredictable. Still, often the plot just drags. Not as brilliant, as vivid as <a href="erikson.htm">Erikson</a>, but still compelling; easily better than 95% of what's out there. Not for the faint of heart.

Lord of the Rings J.R.R. Tolkien 9.4 jrr_tolkien J.R.R. Tolkien, Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring, Two Towers, Return of the King Middle-Earth, and all Fantasy, are firmly rooted in <font style="font:bold 16px">J.R.R. Tolkien's</font> magnificent <font style="font:bold 16px"><U>The Lord of the Rings</U></font>. It's odd, finally coming back to J.R.R.'s opus, after 20-odd years.  Slow getting started, even, the prose being simple in tone, and old as the earth - a child's tale from another age.  Yet the prose builds, grows, develops, so I've shed tears more than once before even completing Part One of the trilogy. Amazing language, compelling, simple and driven eloquence.  Incredible - and though I may estrange the readers of Jordan, Feist, and others whom I also enjoy - none comes close to the Master.

If you've discovered Middle-Earth through director Peter Jackson's <u>The Lord of the Rings</u> movie trilogy, do yourself a favour - read the books!

The Deed of Paksenarrion Elizabeth Moon 8.9 elizabeth_moon Elizabeth Moon, Deed of Paksenarrion, Once a Hero, Esmay Suiza I cannot praise <U>The Deed of Paksenarrion</U>, by <B>Elizabeth Moon</B>, enough - do <I>not</I> be put off by the terrible cover art on the individual volumes of this trilogy. Great stuff.

<p>Says <I>Quantum</I>:

<P><IMG SRC="resources/deed_of_paksenarrion.jpg" align=right alt="The Deed of Paksenarrion cover">
"... superb writing, a sound and gritty knowledge of military life and action ... a psychological/ethical substratum of enviable intricacy and depth..."

<P>"This is the first work of high heroic fantasy I've seen that has taken the work of Tolkien, assimilated it totally and deeply and absolutely, and produced something altogether new and yet incontestably based on the master ... This is the Fourth Age as it has to have been ... Worldbuilding in the grand tradition, background thought out to the last detail, by someone who knows whereof she speaks.  Her military knowledge is impressive, her picture of life in a mercenary company most convincing." says Judith Tarr.

<P>"After so many half-baked clones of Tolkien, and so much generic medieval fantasy, I can't go on enough about how delighted I am to find something of this quality.  Brava!"

<p>Her sci-fi is good - especially the Esmay Suiza cycle, starting with <u>Once a Hero</u>. Space opera, perhaps, but sympathetic, strong characters, a devilishly tangled web of politics, neo-religious fanaticism, pitched tactical battles, and the hard-core science of FTL flight, on-board Environmental, of tactical scan arriving after the enemy has already engaged. The military engagements are hard-won, but brilliant.

<p>Some of her work, unfortunately, is weaker. I would steer away from her <u>Legacy of Gird</u>, unless you absolutely must have the prehistory for the Paksennarion books - quite disappointing.

<p>Esmay Suiza fans will want to follow the Heris Serrano books - much the same, but part of that series, and plot and characters are varied enough that you will likely still enjoy them.

<p>Finally, the Kylara Vatta cyle is much the same. Compelling enough, though I found the last of the series thus far, <u>Engaging the Enemy</u>, rather slow-going stuff, with little of the action or the emotional investment of prior books.

Mistborn Trilogy Brandon Sanderson 8.6 brandon_sanderson_mistborn Brandon Sanderson, Mistborn <p>In Mistborn, Sanderson gives us some classic fantasy, and some that's turned upside down. He brings us great characters. He creates religions and destroys them. And he conjures up some of the most brilliant and novel magic I've ever come across.

<p><IMG SRC="resources/mistborn_final_empire.jpg" align=right alt="Mistborn: the Final Empire cover" height=400 width=263>I've just finished <u>Mistborn</u>.

<p><i>Again.</i>

<p>For the third time. This is one of the few books I return to: it's just that good. 

<p>Even among thousands of other fantasy novel's, Brandon Sanderson's trilogy is different, innovative. To explain, a few mild spoilers follow. You've been forewarned.

<p>Ashfalls rain daily from the sky. Skaa - slaves - scrape ash from stunted plantations, a massive proletariat suppressed by a vicious nobility. A world as designed by the god-king Lord Ruler: an immortal despot ruling with passionless, devastating efficiency. Serving him are a priesthood of obligators, fierce human-like constructs called koloss, and the brilliantly-imagined, terrifying Steel Inquisitors. And the nebulous Deepness, and the Mists - two more enemies, perhaps, and equally satisfying ones.

<p>Skaa have rebelled before, and failed. The Lord Ruler is immortal. His nobility has the power of the Mistborn, of Allomancy. Power to viciously destroy any insurrection; power to control the mind of skaa and suppress it before it happens. Sanderson enemies are wonderful, twisted, sometimes over-the-top and still real.

<p>Most important: Sanderson's characters rule.

<p>Kelsier - skaa thief with Mistborn powers and Messianic aspirations - is fun, smart, unpredictable. Vin, an abused, intelligent skaa girl, is the real hero. The hero, but not the fantasy clich&eacute;: she's different, intelligent, fresh. And that's true for the others, too. Great characters abound.

<p>Mistborn has magic like nothing you've seen before. Three magical systems: Allomancy, Feruchemy, Hemalurgy. Related, yet different, with fascinating properties, powers, limits. Any one of these is as fully realised, plausible, internally consistent as anything else in the fantasy universe - and far, far more than most. (Side note: Sanderson just does great magic. Different every time. Try <u>Elantris</u>, or <a href="http://personal.ars-informatica.ca/paul/fave.php?author=warbreaker_brandon_sanderson">Warbreaker</a>.)

<p>The Mistborn world has a planetary ecology like no other, and yet, one that feels true. As do its politics, its economy, its religions, its laws of physics, its magical systems. 

<p>None of the cheapo, improbable, contrived settings that make for less-than-real fantasies. To his further credit, Sanderson brings us this world naturally, unintrusivey, without exposition. It's just real. And the characters, again - wonderful.

<p>One more thing that raises Mistborn above the masses: it made me think.

<p>Religions are born, rise and fall; Sanderson makes it happen. I could not help but reflect on the nature of faith and of religion; I could not help but deepen my understanding of my own beliefs. It may not do so for you.

<p>The Mistborn trilogy is an epic fantasy. It's satisfying, smart, fun, unpredictable. Full of solid, wonderful characters. No plot cop-outs. The plot moves quickly, twists. And culminates in some great, grand finales.

<p>This folks, is the good stuff.
Name of the Wind Patrick Rothfuss 9.1 Name of the Wind

The Name of the Wind is a fantastic novel by Patrick Rothfuss. It's an incredible debut - he instantly places himself in the select company of Tolkien, Erikson, and few others.

Quothe is the typical hero protagonist: young, naive, sympathetic, and thrust into chaos by a cruel world. And less than typical - he is the prodigy we'd all like to be, and ultimately, a greater failure than any of us. 

Rothfuss's writing is masterful: compelling, supple, robust. At times, it is sublime. A half-feral Quothe mastering music is one wonderful moment of triumph, and it is one of many. His trying for his pipes is my favorite in this book - achingly beautiful stuff.

My only complaint - Patrick, please, write faster! I need the second book.

tam Tam's heron-mark sword Tam's heron-mark sword, as later used by his son, Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn Tam al'Thor's heron-mark sword, museum replicas, katana, fantasy swords, medieval weapons <IMG SRC="wot_icon_sword.gif" align=left hspace=30 vspace=15 alt="heron-mark sword icon"><BR><BR>
<H1>**  Tam's heron-mark sword  **</H1>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>The sword was single-edged, slightly curved, and delicate compared to other swords of the time.  It closely resembles the heron-mark sword depicted to the right, one produced by <A HREF="http://www.museumreplicas.com/mrlwheel.html">Museum Replicas</A> under Jordan's eye, though, as the following text shows, Tam's heron-mark blade also differs from it in some details:

<IMG SRC="heronbld.gif" align=right vspace=10 hspace=15 alt="heron-mark katana"><UL>"The blade, very slightly curved and sharp only on one edge, bore another heron etched into the steel.  Short quillons, worked to look like braid, flanked the hilt.  It seemed almost fragile compared with the swords of the merchants' guards; most of those were double-edged, and thick enough to chop down a tree." &lt;TEotW: 5, 66-7, Winternight&gt;</ul>

<P>This makes it likely that the sword is modelled on a Japanese katana or tachi (very few swords of Western origin have a slightly curved blade, even fewer of these are two-handed).  The longevity of such blades, and the exquisite skill required in their forging, also suggests a katana or tachi as model.  Tam's sword differs from these in that a Western-style crossguard consisting of short quillons is used rather than an oval crossguard, or tsuba, in the Oriental style.

<p>The "... long, two-handed hilt ..."  &lt;TGH: xxiii, Prologue&gt; is leather-wrapped, and referred to repeatedly as "nobby."  &lt;i.e. TEotW: 8, 110, A Place of Safety&gt;

<P>The approximate overall length of his weapon is probably some 37 to 42", a standard length for two-handed katana or tachi, and for many swords of Western design.  Indeed, the <A HREF="http://www.museumreplicas.com/mrlwheel.html">Museum Replicas</A> heron-mark blade is in the katana style; both hilt and quillons differ from Tam's sword.  It is 42&frac12" long, with a blade length of 32&frac12;" and a weight of 1 lb. 9 oz. - values that are likely close to those of Tam's sword.

<IMG SRC="heron.gif" align=left hspace=15 vspace=10 alt="bronze heron"><P>Three herons designate the sword as a blade-master's weapon:<BR><BR>

<UL>"... a long, leather-wrapped hilt inset with a bronze heron.  Another bronze heron stood on the scabbard, and yet another was scribed on the sheathed blade."  &lt;TGH: 1, 4, The Flame of Tar Valon&gt;</UL>

<P>Only one side of sword or scabbard is marked:  in each mention of the sword, only three herons are present; when Thom later indicates the two herons on Rand's coat, Rand comments that "The sword makes five.  Hilt, scabbard and blade."  &lt;TGH: 26, 387, Discord&gt;  Presumably, each heron is found on the outward-facing surface of hilt, scabbard and blade.

<P>My guess is that each heron is of the same size, though this isn't mentioned specifically.  The bronze heron on the hilt is probably some 2 to 2 1/2" in size, with a maximum length of 3" - when the heron-mark is branded into his palm, a perfect figure is impressed on it.  Rand's a big boy, but nowhere are his hands described as meathooks, which Jordan would surely have done, if their size were unusual.

<P>One can even place the heron on the hilt with some accuracy, if one assumes Rand is right-handed.  He must be:  a left-handed swordsman cannot make it through six books without comment.  During his second confrontation with Ba'alzamon &lt;TGH: 15, 241-5, Kinslayer&gt;, Rand is marked with a heron on his right palm.  He'd been holding his sword before him, in both hands.  If right-handed, this would put his right hand above his left, closer to the crossguard, and thus would place the heron a few inches from the crossguard, and on the right side of the hilt (the outward-facing side of the hilt when sheathed).

<P>In the sword form Heron Wading in the Rushes, the sword is " ... held reversed in both hands over his head ..." &lt;TGH: 44, 617, Five Will Ride Forth&gt;, that is, with blade pointing down toward the ground as the beak of a heron hunting for prey.  Rand uses this attack in his first attempt to kill Ba'alzamon, knowing it will likely cause his own death also &lt;TGH: 47, 666, The Grave Is No Bar to My Call&gt;.  Ingtar predicts the same:  "You will put your sword in the other man with that ... but not before he has his through your ribs."  &lt;TGH: 44, 617, Five Will Ride Forth&gt;

<P>This tells us much:  to have the blade reversed, with edge facing one's opponent now places the left palm over a single heron on the hilt.  Heron Wading in the Rushes allows for a single forward thrust or stab, moving the blade from a vertical position through an arc to horizontal.  The dominant hand would be placed above Rand's non-dominant left, for greater thrusting power.  This places the left palm next to the crossguard, and confirms the heron placement cited above.

<P>Curiously, the heron burn would be upside down, an apparent oversight on Jordan's part.  Repositioning the hand to have the heron burn rightside up leaves the swordsman able to skewer himself, only.

<P>Finally, the scabbard is described as black and apparently was unadorned except for the heron.  &lt;TEotW: 5, 66, Winternight&gt;

<p>Rand al'Thor's connection to the Norse god Tyr - god of justice, of swords and war - is explored in the section on <a href="wot.php?page=drag_sceptre">the Dragon Sceptre</a>.

<H1>**  Laman's sword  **</H1>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>Laman's sword would appear to have a blade identical to that of <A HREF="wot.php?page=tam">Tam's sword</A>, including herons, but differs markedly in hilt and scabbard:

<UL>"... the scabbard so encrusted with rubies and moondrops that it was hard to see the gold except where a rising sun had been inset.  The ivory hilt, long enough for two hands, had another inlaid rising sun in gold; the pommel was thick with rubies and moondrops, and still more made a solid mass along the quillons.  This had never been made to use, only to be seen ... Etched into the shining steel stood a heron, symbol of a blademaster."  &lt;TFOH: 21, 388, The Gift of a Blade&gt;</UL>

<p>Rand discards the too-gaudy scabbard, and the ivory hilt for functional reasons:  "... that ivory hilt would twist in a hand slippery with sweat or blood." &lt;TFoH: 21, 388, The Gift of a Blade&gt;  With "... a plain scabbard of brown boarhide, the long hilt covered in the same leather, ..." &lt;TFoH: 23, 412, "The Fifth, I Give You"&gt; sword and scabbard are simply and quickly crafted copies of Tam's heron-mark sword.  Herons on scabbard and hilt are omitted:  when Rand duels Lord Toram, he's given no outward clues of his blademaster's skill, and as such, Caraline is surprised when Rand shows such proficiency against Toram.

<br clear=left>Jordan first portrays <i>sul'dam</i> and <i>damane</i> fountaining water and fire about Bayle Domon's ship <i>Spray</i>:  together, the most powerful weapon that the <a href="wot.php?page=seanchan">Seanchan</a> possess:

<ul>"... two women ... one drawing the other ... by a leash of silvery metal as she climbed aboard.  The leash went from a bracelet worn by the first woman to a collar around the neck of the second.  He could not tell whether it was woven or jointed - it seemed somehow to be both - but it was clearly of a piece with both bracelet and collar.  The first woman gathered the leash in coils as the other came onto the deck.  The collared woman wore plain dark gray and stood with her hands folded and her eyes on the planks under her feet.  The other had red panels bearing forked, silver lightning bolts on the breast of her blue dress and on the sides of her skirts, which ended short of the ankles of her boots." &lt;TGH: 29, 422, Seanchan&gt;</ul>

crown_swords The Crown of Swords Illian's Crown of Swords Crown of Swords, Illian, Rand al'Thor <H1>**  Illian's Crown of Swords  **</H1>

<p>The Crown of Swords consists of a "heavy gold circlet, two inches wide, of laurel leaves ... Almost buried among the laurel leaves of the crown were the sharp points of swords." &lt;ACoS: 41, 662-3, A Crown of Swords&gt;

<p>In <u>The Path of Daggers</u>, reference is made to "tiny blades among its golden laurel leaves." &lt;TPoD: 13, 282, Floating Like Snow&gt; A second reference to "several of the tiny golden sword points" tells us that there are more than just "several" sword. And tiny means, well, tiny. &lt;TPoD: 23, 451, Fog of War, Storm of Battle&gt; Neither of which fit the depiction on the book cover, which shows only a few relatively large swords, pointing up, and prominently arrayed over the laurel leaves, rather than buried within them.

<p>Finally, from <u>Knife of Dreams</u>:

<p><ul>"Half the small swords nestled among the wide band of laurel leaves pointed down, making it uncomfortable to wear, giving constant reminders of its weight, in gold and in responsibility. A small chip in one of those laurel leaves dug at his temple to remind him of the battle against the Seanchan where it had been made." &lt;KoD: 27, 580, A Plain Wooden Box&gt;</ul>

The band of laurel leaves is wider, the swords are smaller, and the swords point up and down. Still, the repeat mention of these sword-points, without further qualifiers, suggests that there were more than just the few depicted here.

shen_calhar Shen an Calhar - the Band of the Red Hand Shen an Calhar - Mat Cauthon's Band of the Red Hand Shen an Calhar, Band of the Red Hand, Mat Cauthon <IMG SRC="wot_icon_dice.gif" align=left hspace=15 vspace=15 alt="five dice icon, sixes up"><BR><BR>
<H1>**  <i>Shen an Calhar</i> - The Band of the Red Hand  **</H1>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT><p><i>Shen an Calhar</i>, or in the Old Tongue, The Band of the Red Hand, comes about almost accidentally as <a href="wot.php?page=mat">Matrim Cauthon</a> tries to flee the impending battle with Couladin's <a href="wot.php?page=aiel">Aiel</a> at Cairhien.

<p>Unable to let a chaotic chaotic jumble of <a href="wot.php?page=tear">Tairen</a> and <a href="wot.php?page=cairhien">Cairhienin</a> fall into an ambush unwarned, he ends up commanding the entire group, fusing them into an effective whole, wielding them as gracefully and as lethally as his <i>ashandarei</i>. By the end of the day, a series of bloody triumphs culminates in Mat's defeat of Couladin himself &lt;TFoH: 43, 684-709, This Place This Day&gt;.

<p>Sometime in the middle of that first day, some 3000 men remain &lt;TFoH: 43, 702, This Place This Day&gt;; the numbers would have been less by its end. Yet Mat's losses are small, though always outnumbered. After that first day, the Tairen Lord Nalesean Aldiaya and Cairhienin Lord Talmanes Delovinde, both stiff-necked noblemen, pledge themselves to Mat without hesitation: "You are our battle leader ... our general." &lt;TFoH: 45, 721, After the Storm&gt;

<p>And somewhere, the Band acquires its name; Mat does not know how. "Some fool got the name from somewhere, and they all started using it." &lt;TFoH: 51, 861, News Comes to Cairhien&gt; It is uncannily appropriate.

<p>The men of the first Band "were the last to fall to the Trollocs, guarding Aemon himself, when Manetheren died. Legend says a spring rose where they fell, to mark their passing ..." &lt;TFoH: 51, 861, News Comes to Cairhien&gt; That is, they died at Emond's Field - Aemon's Field - and the spring is the Winespring, where two thousand years later, Trollocs strike again, and are defeated. Twice.

<p>Where Mat was born.

<p>Mat who, before he has other men's memories interjected with his own, recalls leading Manetheren's Heart Guard into the heart of the advancing Trollocs hordes: <i>"They must win here or die. He was known as a gambler; it was time to toss the dice."</i> &lt;TDR: 19, 216, Awakening&gt;

<p>The Band's banner first appears in Maerone: "a red-fringed white square with a large, open red hand in the center, and beneath it, embroidered in red, the words <i>Dovie'andi se tovya sagain. It's time to toss the dice.</i>" &lt;KoD: 37, 746, Prince of the Ravens; also LoC: 5, 126, A Different Dance&gt;

<p>The Band of the Red Hand even acquires its unofficial anthem on that first, bloody day. Mat teaches them the words to "Dance with Jak o' the Shadows," to divert himself from being stitched; it spreads as wildfire. "Tairen and Cairhienin, horse and foot, had all been singing it when they returned at dawn." &lt;TFoH: 45, 717, After the Storm&gt; One new verse seals them to him:

<ul><i>We'll toss the dice however they fall,<br>
and snuggle the girls be they short or tall,<br>
then follow young Mat whenever he calls,<br>
to dance with Jak o' the Shadows.</i> &lt;TFoH: 45, 722, After the Storm&gt;</ul>

<p>At Maerone, the Band still looks a rag-tag lot: "crossbowmen and archers in jerkins covered with steel discs, pikemen in battered breastplates cast off by their betters or looted from the dead. Everywhere rode breastplated horsemen, Tairen lancers in rimmed helmets and Cairhienin in bell-shaped helmets, even some Andorans in conical helmets with barred face-guards." &lt;LoC: 5, 115, A Different Dance&gt; Edorion probably represents his peers fairly well: "The rimmed helmet bore no plumes now, and chips and dents marred the once ornate gilding on his breastplate." &lt;LoC: 5, 114, A Different Dance&gt;

<P>Mat's 3000 cavalry consists of two banners of 1500 horse, each divided into three squadrons of 500 horse, and further divided into troops of 50; "each squadron and troop with its own long banner bearing the Red Hand, a sword, and a number." &lt;LoC: 5, 126, A Different Dance; also LoC: 22, 341, Heading South; RJWoT: 26, 232, The Military of the Land&gt;

<p>The Band's 3000-odd infantry divides into twelve companies, each with 250 men, 200 of them pike- or billmen, and 50 archers or crossbowmen, "each company behind a drum beating cadence as well as one of the long pennants, theirs with a pike instead of a sword across the hand ..." &lt;LoC: 5, 126, A Different Dance&gt;

<p>Mat's <a href="wot.php?page=drag_legion">Legion of the Dragon</a>, an elite unit of crossbowmen, proves extremely effective. However much he likes his own <a href="wot.php?page=2rivers">Two Rivers longbow</a>, he intends to find crossbows for his archers. &lt;LoC: 5, 118, A Different Dance; RJWoT: 26, 233, The Military of the Land&gt;

<p>By Maerone, Mat has also organized a kind of military police for the Band: "soldiers carrying cudgels and wearing red armbands that stretched from wrist to elbow. Each unit had to take its turn providing Redarms, different men every day, and Redarms had to pay for any damage the day they were on duty." &lt;LoC: 5, 116, A Different Dance&gt;

<p>When Mat rejoins the Band in <u>Knife of Dreams</u>, the Band sports a new look. "Burnished armor was all very well for parades, but it could reflect moonlight as well as sunlight ... the hard part had been convincing the lancers to give up their bright breastplates and the nobles their silvering and gilding. The foot had seen sense straight off." &lt;KoD: 27, 598-599, A Plain Wooden Box&gt; Captain Mandevwin appears in a green-painted, open-faced footman's helmet; his crossbowmen in dark coats and dull green armour that fade into the foliage. Even Talmanes wears the same dull green breasplate, though under a dark silk coat. &lt;KoD: 27, 598-599, A Plain Wooden Box, also KoD: 36, 728-9, Under an Oak&gt; Camouflage armour.

<p>Some of the Band wear red cloth tied around the left arm: presumably his Redarms, reinvented. Certainly far less conspicuous than a sleeve red from the elbow down.

<p>Mat's crossbowmen, re-equipped, are lethally effective. Their primary weapons are the new crank-equipped crossbows: "Three turns of the new crank ... and the bowstring is latched. With a little training, a man can get off seven or eight quarrels in a minute. With a heavy crossbow." &lt;KoD: 26, 554, As If the World Were Fog&gt; Quarrels punch through breastplates and shatter legs. In more detail:

<ul><img src="xbow_windlass.gif" alt="windlass-operated crossbow; woodcut from Nordisk familjebok" align="right">"... the fellow bent to fasten the paired hooks of the bulky, boxlike crank, hanging from a strap at the front of his belt, to his crossbow string. As the man straightened, the cord streamed out of the crank, but once he was erect, he set the crank on the butt of the upended crossbow, moved a small lever on the side of the box, and began to work the handles. Three quick turns with a rough whirring sound, and the string caught on the latch." &lt;KoD: 27, 602, A Plain Wooden Box&gt;</ul>

<p>Depicted to the right is a windlass-operated crossbow - the cord streaming from the crank makes this the more likely real-world match, as opposed to a cranequin mechanism. Either type of mechanism, however, requires far more than three turns to draw fully. This makes sense: a bow too heavy to draw by hand can be drawn mechanically using less force, if applied over a longer period of time.

<p>Jordan suggests crossbowmen and sling-men are identical in appearance, but for their primary weapons &lt;KoD: 37, 743, Prince of the Ravens&gt;. As such, they likely carry the same shortswords - a logical assumption. Once the enemy closes, the front rank must drop its bows, and only a shortsword is of any use in close formation.

<p>Talmanes' cavalry are lancers, primarily, but versatile enough not to need those lances. Against the Seanchan allies, they fire from horsebows: "a volley from four thousand bows at three hundred paces that cleared saddles." &lt;KoD: 37, 747, Prince of the Ravens&gt; A very long bowshot, even with a longbow, drawn to the chest; impossible to get both that range and accuracy from a horsebow. Unless, as I discussed under the <a href="wot.php?page=2rivers">Two Rivers bow</a>, Jordan's pace is a more flexible <a href="wot.php?page=measures">measure of distance</a> than implied elsewhere. If a pace is about 24-26" in real-world length, then his description matches that of horsebows in our world.

<p>On closing with the enemy, Talmanes' men drop their bows and use their swords &lt;KoD: 37, 748, Prince of the Ravens&gt;.

<p>Sling-men also appear in this battle. "Tall men [with] ... shortswords they called cat-gutters, but instead of crossbows, they were armed with four-foot sling-staffs ... Each man wore a cloth belt sewn with pockets slung across his breastplate, and each pocket held a stubby leather cylinder larger than a man's fist with a short length of dark fuse sticking out the end." &lt;KoD: 37, 743, Prince of the Ravens&gt;

<p>Slow-burning "matches" are held between the teeth, and a cylinder is attached to the sling-staff. The fuse is touched to the match, the staff whipped back then forward, and the projectile launched 100 feet or more &lt;KoD: 37, 743-748, Prince of the Ravens&gt;.

lan al'Lan Mandragoran al'Lan Mandragoran, the uncrowned king of Malkier, Gaidin to Moiraine and Ninaeve Aes Sedai al'Lan Mandragoran, Malkier, Malkieri <IMG SRC="wot_icon_flame_tar_valon.gif" align=left hspace=20 vspace=15 alt="Flame of Tar Valon icon"><BR><BR>
<H1>**  al'Lan Mandragoran  **</H1>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>Jordan describes the sword of the Malkieri as "... almost a twin of Rand's except for the lack of herons ..." &lt;TGH: 1, 5, The Flame of Tar Valon&gt;  Like <A HREF="wot_tam.htm">Tam's sword</A>, it was Power-wrought by Aes Sedai, in times far past, needs no sharpening, and will never rust.  'Nuff said.

<P>Except in settings where he might be recognized as a Warder by his clothes, he wears a typical (for <a href="wot_gaidin.htm">Gaidin</a>) dark green coat and fancloth cloak:  "... a dark grayish green that would have faded into leaf or shadow, and his cloak swirled through shades of gray and green and brown as it shifted in the wind.  It almost seemed to disappear at times ... fading into whatever lay beyond it ..." &lt;TEotW: 2, 29, Strangers; see also RJWoT: 3, 36-38, The Age of Legends&gt;  Though the cloak is mentioned frequently, the dark, olive-green coat doesn't reappear until ACoS &lt;ACoS: 12, A Morning of Victory, 232; 37, A Note from the Palace, 580; etc.&gt;.

<P>Lan dons his matching armor more rarely, a "... gray-green scaled armor that would make him all but disappear in forest or darkness." &lt;TGH: 9, 147, Leavetakings&gt;  In the Blight, he also wears steel-backed gauntlets, though this is the only place where these are mentioned for Lan &lt;TEotW: 49, 753, The Dark One Stirs&gt;.

<p>The <i>hadori</i>, the braided leather cord about his temples, holds back the shoulder-length hair of Malkieri warriors. Also described as a "narrow leather headband," &lt;TEotW: 2, 50, Strangers&gt; it apparently binds tightly: a Malkieri named Kurenin abandoned it, but apparently "The years had not erased the marks of his <i>hadori</i> completely." &lt;<a href="wot.htm#refs">Legends</a>: 642, New Spring; see also Legends: 638, New Spring&gt;

<p>For the inside back cover of <u>Legends</u> (see my <a href="wot.php?page=kandori">Kandori page</a>, Sweet depicts the <i>hadori</i> as red. In all Jordan's descriptions, colour is never mentioned, and it is much more likely that it is unstained or undyed in any way.

<P>Particular also to Lan is one more outward marker, the ring of the Malkieri kings, "... a signet ring, heavy gold and worn with age, almost large enough for both her thumbs to fit through.  On it, a crane flew above a lance and crown, all carefully wrought in detail." &lt;TGH: 8, 135, The Dragon Reborn&gt; katana
perrin Perrin Perrin Aybara's axe, Perrin the Warrior's unwanted weapon Perrin's axe, battleaxe, battle ax <IMG SRC="wot_icon_wolf.gif" align=left hspace=30 vspace=15 alt="wolf icon"><BR>
<IMG SRC="axe.gif" align=right hspace=15 vspace=10 alt="Perrin Aybara's axe"><BR>
<H1>**  Perrin's axe  **</H1>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>This axe consisted of "A broad half-moon blade on one side of the head and a curved spike on the other ..." &lt;TEotW: 10, 138, Leavetaking&gt;.  "The ashwood shaft was as long as his arm, and smooth ... to the touch."  &lt;TEotW: 30, 439, Children of Shadow&gt;.  It is likely that it is primarily intended for single-handed use:  Perrin uses it from his saddle while standing in the stirrups and moving forward &lt;TEotW: 49, 736, The Dark One Stirs&gt;, i.e. he'd need the other hand to hold the reins.  At least once, however, he uses his axe in both hands &lt;TDR: 34, 396, A Different Dance&gt;.

<P><A HREF="wot.php?page=whitecloaks">Child Byar</A>, an obvious connoisseur of battle axes, lauds it as "Excellently balanced ... Plainly made, but by a very good weaponsmith, perhaps even a master ... Not a villager's weapon, ... nor a farmer's."  &lt;TEotW: 30, 450, Children of the Shadow&gt;

<P>This "great-bladed" &lt;TEotW: 13, 177, Choices&gt; axe is "By weight of metal ... a good five or six pounds lighter than the hammer ..."  &lt;TDR: 50, 597, The Hammer&gt;; more specifically, <a href="wot.php?page=perrin_hammer">Perrin's ten-pound hammer</a> "weighed more than twice as much as the axe blade ..."  This axe head, then, weighs some four to four-and-a-half pounds, including *both* blade and spike.

<P>Such a "... great, steel half-moon" &lt;TGH: xxiii, Prologue&gt; would feature an 8 to 10" face, likely closer to 10"; larger faces thin the blade excessively, within the weight restraints given above.  Many of the larger, two-handed European battle axes had 8 to 9" blade faces, with a rare 10" face; the smaller battle axes very typically had a 5" face ... for those who think that a 10-inch blade isn't very big ...

<P>The spike found opposite of the half-blade is described as curved, but far more commonly is described as thick.  It is likely that the curve is a slight one; a noticeable curve would have been mentioned in the axe's description far more frequently.  Perrin, "... with the spike foremost ... drove the spike into the <A HREF="wot.php?page=trollocs">Trolloc's</A> temple" &lt;TDR: 4, 66, Shadows Walking&gt;, and instantly kills it; to do so would require at least the 5 to 6" length standard for such spikes.  An excessive curve to the spike would've made this maneuver very difficult.

<P>The larger European war axes often sported a 5 to 6" spike opposite the blade; these were typically slightly curved, or straight.  Very commonly, the spike was quadrangular in cross-section, occasionally triangular.  Perrin's axe most likely follows this model.

<P><IMG SRC="perrin.jpg" align=left hspace=15 alt="Perrin Aybara"><A NAME="meas"></A>Finally, the ashwood haft is defined as "... a pace long..."  &lt;LoC: Prologue, 39, The First Message&gt;, 36" in real-world units, about as long Perrin's arm, including outstretched hand.  I have previously argued for a somewhat shorter handle, some 26 to 30" long, given the apparent flexibility of some of Jordan's <A HREF="wot.php?page=measures">measurements</A>.  A longer axe becomes unwieldy; Perrin's axe is easily concealed beneath his cloak, and never described or perceived as long-handled, unwieldy, or clumsy, though he takes it everywhere.

<P>Plainly made, and presumably lacking the simple ornamentation shown on the cover of TDR; Sweet also lops off the upper tip of the half-moon.  The illustration on page 202 of RJWoT (left) has since eclipsed Sweet's version, and fits the facts far better.

<p><a href="wot.php?page=perrin_hammer">Perrin's hammer</a> is described separately.
shad_logoth The Shadar Logoth dagger Evil incarnate: the tainted dagger taken from Shadar Logoth by still-innocent Matrim Cauthon, and now corrupted and twisted by Padan Fain. Source of Rand's unhealing, immortal wound, how can this dagger not come back to play a final, black role? Shadar Logoth dagger, tainted, Padan Fain <IMG SRC="wot_icon_dagger.gif" align=left hspace=15 vspace=15 alt="Shadar Logoth dagger icon"><BR><BR>
<H1>**  The ruby-hilted dagger from Shadar Logoth  **</H1>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>This tainted, twisted dagger is taken from Shadar Logoth by a still-innocent Matrim Cauthon, and it almost destroys him. It finds a new owner in Padan Fain; the dagger is further corrupted by Fain, and Fain by it. The Shadar Logoth dagger is the source of the unhealing, immortal wound in Rand's side. Major unresolved threads: Rand's wound ("his blood upon the rocks"?), and Padan Fain's undying Compulsion for vengeance. How can this dagger not gouge a final deep rent through the Pattern?

<p>This strongly curved dagger probably closely resembles a Middle Eastern jambiya; Jordan's description is simple and elegant.

<UL>"A curved dagger with a gold scabbard worked in strange symbols.  Fine gold wrapped the hilt, which was capped by a ruby as big as Rand's thumbnail, and the quillons were golden-scaled serpents baring their fangs."  &lt;TGH: 24, 359, Flight Down the Arinelle&gt;</UL>

<P>Little information is given in terms of size.  However, even if slid fully from its sheath, it is small enough that Mat can hide dagger and scabbard both with his body.  &lt;TGH: 24, 359, Flight Down the Arinelle&gt; This suggests the dagger's length is at most, say, 12", though this is hardly certain. The Jordan-approved dagger created by <A HREF="http://www.museumreplicas.com/home.htm">Museum Replicas</A> (see below) is 17" in length.

<IMG SRC="ShadLogoth_dagger.jpg" align=left hspace=15 vspace=15 style="border:solid #e0e0e0" alt="Shadar Logoth dagger - RJWoT">
<P>The curve of the weapon is pronounced:  "The bare blade curved like a horn ..." &lt;TGH: 19, 297, Beneath the Dagger&gt;.  The ruby is repeatedly referred to as "capping" the hilt, i.e. "... a ruby the size of a pigeon's egg capping the hilt ..." &lt;TDR: 10, 137, Secrets&gt; which likely places it atop the very end of the hilt, rather than being set into the side of the hilt, and is described further as "... dark as a drop of blood..." &lt;TDR: 19, 220, Awakening&gt;

<P>So what did Fain's dagger truly look like? Except for the serpent cross-guard, the depiction in RJWoT (left) could be fairly accurate. &lt;RJWoT: 24, 221, The White Tower&gt; Alternately, the dagger may come closer to the stylized chapter icon shown above. Or, perhaps, it resembles the dagger below - commissioned and approved by Jordan himself, and crafted by <A HREF="http://www.museumreplicas.com/home.htm">Museum Replicas</A>:
<br clear=all>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="ShadLogoth_dagger.gif" alt="Shadar Logoth dagger - museumreplicas.com"></CENTER>

<p>... but however much I would be tempted to proclaim this definitive Shadar Logoth dagger - it jars with Jordan's own description. Above, a single serpent forms the guard - not serpents - and not in the form of quillons, i.e. an extended cross-guard extending from their base or quillon block, though clearly and repeatedly mentioned in the WoT.

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>This "... odd black-hafted spear with a short sword blade in place of a spearpoint, slightly curved and single-edged ..." &lt;TSR: 26, 437, The Dedicated&gt; follows the design of a basic Western glaive; some such are richly ornamented and a perfect match for Mat's <I>ashandarei</I>.  Glaives however can widely vary in appearance; the Japanese naginata has a far more stereotypical form and is also an excellent match. This is, incidentally, the form depicted on the cover of CoT:

<p>Not untypically, the cover art deviates from Jordan's description in multiple respects. The <i>haft should be black</i>, and "A line of some strange cursive script [that] ran its length, bracketed by a pair of birds inlaid on metal even darker than the wood.  Ravens ... Another pair were engraved on the blade ..." All these are overlooked &lt;TSR: 26, 438, The Dedicated&gt;.

<P>Specifically, these words were inscribed upon the haft, in a script Rand could not read, and presumably in the Old Tongue:

<IMG SRC="nagin2.gif" align=right>

<UL>"Thus is our treaty written; thus is agreement made.<BR>Thought is the arrow of time; memory never fades.<BR>What was asked is given.  The price is paid."<BR>&lt;TSR: 26, 439, The Dedicated&gt;</UL>

<P>Thought and Memory are the names of Odin's twin ravens in Norse mythology; their identification with Mat is no coincidence, as <a href=#odin>discussed also below</a>.

<p>The blade itself was 2' in length &lt;TFoH: 3, 113, Pale Shadows&gt;, of black metal; the raven markings are at the point of the blade &lt;TSR: 37, 606, Imre Stand&gt;.  The "... iron-hard black haft ..." &lt;TSR: 37, 612, Imre Stand&gt; could be either round or oval in cross-section; if modelled on the naginata, it would be oval.

<P>The length of the weapon is unclear:  Mat standing straight has the sword blade beginning just level with his head &lt;TSR: 26, 439, The Dedicated&gt;.  That is, if the blade starts level with the start of his head, the length of the weapon is about 82", if level with the top of his head, about 95".  If a length of 20" is assumed for the 2' blade, the overall length becomes either 78 or 91" respectively.  Either length is typical for a polearm, though the shorter length seems more likely for a weapon used out of formation, and is more typical of the Japanese naginata.

<P>Also worth of comment, not only for sake of the imagery involved, which surely is Jordan at his finest, are Mat's medallion, and the ring he acquires in ACoS.  His medallion consists of "... a silver foxhead that almost filled his palm ..." &lt;TSR: 26, 438, The Dedicated&gt;, or 3" or so across - a gift from the Eelfinn, the Foxes, themselves:

<UL>"The pupil of the fox's eye was a tiny circle split by a sinuous line, one polished bright, the other shaded in some way.  The ancient symbol of Aes Sedai ..." &lt;TSR: 37, 606, Imre Stand&gt;</UL>

<P>Since only the one eye is mentioned here, and elsewhere, the foxhead likely consists of a side-profile view &lt;TFoH: 6, 161, Gateways; KoD: 9, 238, A Short Path, etc.&gt;, though one eye might be missing - no coincidence, given the <a href=#odin>prophecy below</a>.

<P>Mat's ring foreshadows his fate: to marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons. "Inside a border of large crescents, a running fox seemed to have startled two birds into flight ... He certainly needed to be crafty as a fox ... the medallion had made him fond of foxes." &lt;ACoS: 16, 300, A Touch on the Cheek&gt; Indeed, the crescent border consists of nine crescent moons &lt;KoD: 36, 736, Under An Oak&gt;. Mat himself is the fox. The two birds are undoubtedly ravens, like the twin ravens engraved on blade and haft of his <I>ashandarei</I> - symbols of the Seanchan Imperial family. Tuon's sigil is the Raven-and-Roses, and when Mat marries her, he becomes Prince of the Ravens &lt;TSR: 38, 635, Hidden Faces; WH: 14, 323, What a Veil Hides; KoD: 37, 750, Prince of the Ravens&gt;.

<ul>"Fortune rides like the sun on high<br>
with the fox that makes the ravens fly.<br>
Luck his soul, the lightning his eye,<br>
He snatches the moons from out of the sky."<br>
&lt;CoT: 28, 616, A Cluster of Rosebuds&gt;</ul>

<p>Tuon's fortune-telling is very similar:

<ul>"Beware the fox that makes the ravens fly, for he will marry you and carry you away. Beware the man who remembers Hawkwing's face, for he will marry you and set you free. Beware the man of the red hand, for him you will marry and none other." &lt;KoD: 36, 734, Under An Oak&gt;</ul>

<p><a name=odin>Mat is Jordan's Odin - the primary god of war of Norse mythology, instigator of battles, and bringer of victory. Odin's two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, or Thought and Memory, are clearly named on his <I>ashandarei</I>. The <i>ashandarei</i> is analogous to Gungnir, Odin's spear: strong, slender, dwarven-forged, never missing its mark. Odin's ring, Draupnir, does not clearly match Mat's, though it represented Odin's supremacy over the Nine Worlds. Unless, of course, the Nine Moons represent something similar ...

<p>Odin who, seeking wisdom, died on the World Tree Yggdrasil and lived again, who sacrificed an eye to Mimir's well, surely inspires Mat's fate:

<ul>"To die and live again, and live once more a part of what was!"<br>
"To give up half the light of the world to save the world!" ...<br>
"Go to Rhuidean, son of battles!" &lt;TSR: 15, 253, Into the Doorway&gt;</ul>

<p>And so Rand finds Mat hung low from the branches of <i>Avendesora</i>, the Tree of Life, breathless, pulseless, even as Odin hung from the World Tree and lived again &lt;TSR: 26, 437, The Dedicated&gt;.  That Mat, like Odin, should sacrifice an eye - "To give up half the light of the world to save the world" seems inescapable, given Egwene's dream of Mat:  "... blood streaming down his face, the wide brim of his hat pulled low so she could not see his wound ..." &lt;TFoH: 15, 301, What Can Be Learned in Dreams&gt;

<P>Mat echoes Odin down to the broad-brimmed hat the latter often wore. Though Mat changes his shirts and coats routinely, his hat is constant:  black, wide-brimmed and flat-crowned; it otherwise goes undescribed &lt;TSR: 36, 588, Misdirections; ACoS: 15, 286, Insects; numerous other references&gt;.

<p>Finally, Odin is destined to lead the glorious dead into Ragnarok, the Last Battle, in a final, annihilating fight against chaos. A myth that probably led to his association with the Wild Hunt - led by a multitude of heroes in other nations, but by Odin in parts of Scandinavia. Mat calls forth the Heroes of the Horn, initially at Falme, and undoubtedly will do the same for Jordan's Last Battle, as well.

enc1 Raised Beds environment raised beds Raised bed gardening offers convenience and the potential for very area-intensive gardening Raised beds allow for gardening above the level of the surrounding <a>soil</a>;
in areas of poorly-drained clay or infertile sandy soils, it is possible to
create deep beds filled with fertile, well-drained soil.  Elevated above the
surrounding ground, they are easier to work without strain; since they
aren't walked on, soil compaction is prevented, which in turn allows for
significantly more intensive planting than would otherwise be the case.
Raised beds can be quite attractive, and make effective gardening available also to wheelchair gardeners.

<p>Mounding the surface is only one way of raised bed gardening, and the
easiest.  However, other, walled forms of raised beds, also have better
<a>drainage</a> than ordinary garden soil, and it may be easier as well as better
to build a few, and work the soil under and in the beds intensively.  Bricks,
concrete blocks, untreated railroad ties, large logs, all make good and attractive raised bed material.

<p><center><a href="gallery.php?img=74&sub=enc1"><img src="images/raised_bed.jpg" class="sketch_c" alt="New raised bed being prepared for planting, with a mixture of the original heavy clay soil, heavily amended with peat and compost" title="New raised bed being prepared for planting, with a mixture of the original heavy clay soil, heavily amended with peat and compost" width="400" height="260"></a></center>

<p>Untreated railroad ties may be used 'as is,' though of course they'll break
down quicker than if treated.  Such a raised bed is <a>illustrated</a>, i.e. a simple
frame constructed from rough-sawn 6x6" <a>hemlock</a> timbers, set on a stony
and very heavy clay soil.  The soil from inside the frame was removed in
small amounts, and mixed by hand with <a>peat moss</a> and <a>compost</a>, to
create a very fine, loose, crumbly mixture; rocks were manually removed.

<p>While this takes a significant amount of time and effort, this kind of investment is made only once.  The end result, a very well-drained, rich soil that
is easily worked and very intensively planted, is still a pleasure to use.

<p>Alternatively, make walls out of concrete panels.  Mix 1 part Portland cement with 3 parts pebbles and 3 parts sand; oil forms so the panels pop
out.  Chicken wire can be used for reinforcement.  Cinderblocks also work
well, but need to be mortared in place.  Hay bales will work, but are even
shorter-lived than wood. wood preservatives, cold frames, drainage, floating row covers raised bed
woo0 Wood Preservatives environment wood preservatives, organic, safe, arsenic, pressure-treated An organic wood preservative recipe, presented as alternative to arsenic-based, pressure-treated lumber Keep pressure-treated wood or creosote-preserved stuff away from your
<a>Fruits and Vegetables</a>.  Arsenic-based compounds that have been pressure-forced into
treated lumber have been shown repeatedly to leach out into soil in potentially toxic amounts - so why bother when safe alternatives exist?

<p><U>Organic Gardening</u> magazine published a wood preservative recipe safe
for vegetable garden borders:  mix 1 gallon mineral spirits with two cups
of boiled linseed oil and 2 or 3 ounces of melted paraffin.  Paint it onto
your lumber, in several layers, and let dry a couple of days.

<p>Note that mineral spirits may not be available locally.  Do not use paint
thinners instead - these solvents can be quite toxic, and should not be
substituted.  I personally have used mineral oil (used as a laxative and/or
skin cleaner, and also known as liquid paraffin) instead, with good effect; I tend
to go up on the linseed oil concentration.  Linseed oil itself is also quite
safe (raw linseed oil may be fed to livestock), though it helps protect against
sun, water, wind and salt, as well as fungal attack. raised beds, cold frames
tre0 Trees and Shrubs plant_family trees, shrubs, propagation, seed, cuttings, layering See the sections on specific propagation techniques (growing from <a>seed</a>, <a>cuttings</a>, etc.) for general information.

<p>More precise details on how to reproduce a species are given only if these differ from the usual.  That is, a germinating temperature

etc., unless otherwise stated.

Coniferous trees may be propagated by <a>stem cuttings</a> taken from young, vigorous growing tips, each
with a small brown hardwood base.  Remove the lower 1 1/2" of needles

orc0 Orchids plant_family orchids, Douglas fir bark, Osmunda <a href="gallery.php?img=103&sub=orc0"><img src="images/phalaenopsis_concorde.jpg" align=right title="Phalaenopsis orchid 'Concorde'" alt="Phalaenopsis orchid 'Concorde'" height="250" width="172" vspace=10 hspace=15></a>
Orchids are grown in various <a>media</a>, but most commonly Douglas fir bark,
which is light, porous, and drains very readily.  Ordinary soil will keep oxygen from roots:  most orchids are epiphytes whose aerial roots require
free access to the air.  Plants should be repotted before the medium decomposes.  Special feeding needs are discussed separately, in the <a>Fertilizers</a> section.

<p>Another orchid growth medium is Osmunda (a genus of ferns), a now rare organic substrate that requires no additional fertilization.  If inorganic media are used, both nutrients and fertilizers should be provided.

<p>Feeding should be done frequently, up to weekly or every few weeks
during the growing season, with diluted <a>fertilizers</a>.  See individual species
for recommendations.  Again, plants potted in Osmunda require no additional fertilization.

<p><a>Compost tea</a> and diluted seafood extracts may be used to grow orchids very successfully, organically.

<p>Orchids may be propagated by <a>pseudobulb division</a>. Propagation from <a>seed</a> requires an expert hand as well as specialized <a>media</a>, equipment, and techniques: this subject is beyond the scope of this database. orchids orchid
gra2 Bud Grafting techniques bud grafting <img src="sketches/graft4.jpg" class="sketch" alt="In chip-budding, a chip of wood is removed from the grafting stock, and a chip of scion with bud is grafted into the gap" title="In chip-budding, a chip of wood is removed from the grafting stock, and a chip of scion with bud is grafted into the gap">
Bud grafting consists of grafting a piece of scion bearing a single bud, onto the rootstock.  Two techniques are mentioned here, and may often be
used interchangeably:  T-budding, and chip-budding.  The latter is illustrated to the right.

<p>In T-budding, a 'T' is cut into the rootstock, and the bark is gently peeled
back, so that a small section of scion, with bud, may be slid in behind
these flaps of bark, and secured until the two unite.  Even when the graft
has taken well, however, the rootstock should not be cut back until the
next winter.

<p>A variant known as chip-budding may also be used:  rather than cutting a
'T' into the rootstock, a small chip of wood is removed from the rootstock,
and a matching chip of scion, with bud, is grafted into the gap.  With both
techniques, be careful when handling the bud chip:  do not handle by the
moist cambium on the inside of the new chip, but handle by the bud or
outer bark only.

grs0 Grains and Grasses plant_family grasses, grains <a href="gallery.php?img=126&sub=grs0"><img src="images/grass_close-up.jpg" title="grass" alt="grass" height="211" class="sketch"></a>

See the sections on specific propagation techniques for general information.  More precise details on how to reproduce a species are given only if these differ from the usual.  Virtually all grasses can be started from seed, with few exceptions.  Some cultivars will not come "true" if grown from seed, and while bamboos can produce seed, they do so extremely unreliably; these are best propagated vegetatively.

<p>Full sun is appreciated by almost all grasses, though some species are
more shade-tolerant than others; see below.  Well-drained <a>soil</a> is also important; moisture needs, however, are quite variable, depending on the
species.

<p>Lawn grasses are roughly divided into cool-season and warm-season
grasses.  The former prefer growing temperatures of 60-75F/15-24C, and
the latter of 80-95F/27-35C.  Moisture needs and other concerns also affect the choice of a lawn grass; a local lawn-care company or nursery may
help determine which lawn grasses are best suited to a given area.

<p>All lawn grasses may be grown from seed, unless otherwise indicated;
best sowing times are early fall or spring.  Sowing densities are not indicated here, as these depend on the actual species mixtures used.  Seedlings require even moisture and regular feeding. see0 grasses

See the sections on specific propagation techniques for information on those techniques.  More precise details on how to reproduce a species are given only if these differ from the usual.  That is, a germinating temperature

See the sections on specific propagation techniques for general information.  More precise details on how to reproduce a species are given only if these differ from the usual.  That is, a germinating temperature
of 60 to 65F (15 to 18C) is assumed, <a>air layering</a> is done in early summer,
etc., unless otherwise stated.

<p>Fruit trees are easily grown.  Note, however, that many need to be cross-pollinated in order to produce fruit, and that a cold period of variable length,
or chilling period, is typically required to break dormancy.  This period of
time varies markedly even within a species, depending on the cultivar,
and one should check carefully whether a given type will reliably produce
fruit in a specific area, before buying. fruit
cac0 Cacti and Succulents plant_family cacti, succulents <a href="gallery.php?img=21&sub=cac0"><img src="images/Euphorbia_enterophora.jpg" title="Euphorbia enterophora, syn. Euphorbia xylophylloides. Purchased cutting dipped in rooting hormone, allowed to form callus for a week prior to planting in gritty, very well-drained medium" alt="Euphorbia enterophora, syn. Euphorbia xylophylloides. Purchased cutting dipped in rooting hormone, allowed to form callus for a week prior to planting in gritty, very well-drained medium" height="250" width="209" class="sketch"></a>
See the sections on specific propagation techniques for general information, especially those for <a>seed</a> and <a>cuttings</a>.  More precise details
on reproducing a species are given only if these differ from the usual.

<p>For cacti and succulents, warmer germinating temperatures are beneficial, i.e. 70-80F/21-27C and coarsely gritty, very well-draining <a>soil</a> is ideal;
fine sand should not be part of the <a>growing medium</a> as it can actually let
the soil compact to a rock-like consistency.  Water regularly and thoroughly during growth, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and less
frequently when not actively growing.

<p>Seed is often surface-sown, as light is typically needed for germination. 
Soil should be slightly moist prior to germination; after germination, the
soil surface should be allowed to dry out for very brief periods of time, until
the plants mature.  For most cacti and succulents, germination is erratic.

<p>Water from below after germination, especially if seedlings are very small,
and allow to dry out between waterings.  Bottom heat and warm ambient
temperatures (75F/24C daytime, 70F/21C at night) are ideal.  Seed and
young seedlings should be protected from the midday sun.

<p><center><a href="gallery.php?img=25&sub=cac0"><img src="images/cactus_seedlings.jpg" title="cactus seedlings - several months old and only 1-2 mm across - in well-drained, gritty soil" alt="cactus seedlings - several months old and only 1-2 mm across - in well-drained, gritty soil" height="250" width="270" class="sketch_c"></a></center>

<br clear=all>Do not prick seedlings out until the second year after sowing, when bodies are
some 1/4" thick, and distinct roots and spines have formed.  Succulents
grow much quicker and may be transplanted within weeks or months.

<p>Transplant into light, porous medium, being careful to protect the tender
roots.  Long roots may be trimmed but roots should never be bent; the
neck of the roots must be at the soil surface.  Water for several days after
transplanting; transplant only during the growing season.

<p>Cacti and succulents often tolerate higher concentrations of <a>fertilizer</a> without ill
effect; fertilize regularly. Try tomato or rose fertilizer (rich in magnesium
and phosphorus) with flowering plants, half-strength on young plants.  For
young seedlings, use only diluted solutions.  Fertilize in the evenings.

<p>Some of the cylindrical cacti produce smaller plants at their bases: these may be pulled
off, left to form a callus over a week or two, then potted.

<p>Succulent <a>cuttings</a> should be several inches in length, and are left to root
in air, or at least allowed a few hours, usually days, to callus.  When potted, water only sparingly, and keep in a drier atmosphere.  Benign neglect is always a good policy.  Do not take cuttings from the woody stems
of succulents.

<p>Leaves from succulents can often be broken from the stem, and kept
warm and shady.  Allow to wrinkle, wait for appearance of roots and very
small new plantlets, often months.  Then lay flat on <a>soil</a> in a small pot.
Water lightly and infrequently, and ignore. division cacti
wat1 Water Plants plant_family water plants <a href="gallery.php?img=125&sub=wat1"><img src="images/European_white_waterlily.jpg" title="European white waterlilies" alt="European white waterlilies" height="201" class="sketch"></a>

See the sections on specific propagation techniques for general information.  More precise details on how to reproduce a species are given only if these differ from the usual.

<p>Propagation of water plants, especially by <a>seed</a> or <a>cuttings</a>, differs from
that of their land-bound cousins.  Seed should be sown immediately
when fresh, since drying out quickly kills the seed of most species.  Regardless of how deep a plant grows, seed is sown just covered on regular, sterile, seed-starting <a>medium</a>; seed trays are then set in some other
container so that the water level is just below the <a>soil</a> level - old aquaria
work well.

<p>When germination occurs, raise the water level for deep water aquatics,
so these are covered completely, and continue to bring it up as the plant
grows; other plants may be kept very wet.  When true leaves develop,
seedlings may be pricked out and grown on in larger <a>pots</a>; repot as necessary during growth.  Ample <a>light</a> should be provided throughout.

<p>Similarly, root and stem cuttings are planted into heavy soil or muddy clay;
for deep-water plants, <a>root cuttings</a> should be just covered with water.  As
new plants grow, gradually submerge deep-water plants, so that the
shoots stay just at or below the water surface.  Stem cuttings benefit from
use of <a>rooting hormone</a>; water should just cover the soil surface, but not
the cuttings themselves.  Once rooted, cuttings may be lowered to their final depth.  Marginal plants should be kept very wet, but not submerged.

<p>For aquarium plants, in general, provide water of 3 to 12 degrees of hardness, a water temperature of 70-85F/21-29C, and a depth of up to 20" are
ideal, as is a pH in the range of 6.5-7.5.  Where cultural conditions differ
significantly from these values, this is indicated.  Finally, <a>aquarium lighting</a>
is discussed in detail, elsewhere. see0 aquatic

2 Coccinellidae family ladybug, ladybirds, convergent lady beetles predatory and parasitic insects Ladybugs, ladybirds, or lady beetles, in their many forms, can be very effective in organic pest control, especially against <a>aphids</a>. They may also work against <a>scale insects</a>, <a>mites</a> and <a>mealybugs</a>. 

<p>Convergent lady beetles, Hippodamia convergens, especially are available commercially; each can eat about 50 aphids in a day. Their larvae also consume significant numbers of aphids. Note however that many such insects quickly leave their site of release, especially if the pest density is low.

<p>Japanese ladybugs, Harmonia axyridis, destroy aphids in large quantities, though may be a problem when they look for a safe place to overwinter. Hippodamia convergens, Harmonia axyridis, Japanese ladybugs
4 Braconidae family braconid wasps predatory and parasitic insects Braconid wasps are beneficial <a>parasitic wasps</a> within the larger superfamily of <a>Ichneumoidae</a>. They are very small - up to 6 mm or 1/4 inch long. Larval forms can be very effective parasites of garden pests, including various <a>aphids</a>, and <a>caterpillar</a> forms of many moths and butterflies. 

<p>Adults require the nectar of small flowering plants, as well as moisture and protection from the elements. These requirements are covered in more detail in our general information on <a href="pest_solution.php?en=41">beneficial wasps</a>.

<p>Two groups of braconids are especially useful, and available commercially: various <a>Aphidius species</a>, which prey on aphids, and <a>Cotesia</a>, used against <a>armyworms</a>, <a>cabbage worms</a>, <a>cutworms</a>, <a>earworms</a>, <a>loopers</a>, <a>hornworms</a>, and <a>webworms</a>, among others.

<p>Note that parasitic wasps are easily killed by <a>insecticides</a>, though they typically work well when used together with other biological controls.
5 insecticidal soap insecticides Two tablespoons of ordinary liquid dish soap or detergent per gallon of water easily kills small, soft-bodied insects; stronger solutions are needed for larger insects. Insecticidal soap is especially effective against <a>aphids</a>, <a>spider mites</a>, <a>thrips</a>, <a>mealybugs</a>, and <a>whiteflies</a>. Hard water mixed with soap is not very effective: try soft or rainwater instead.
 
<p><i>Insecticidal soap can damage plants.</i>

<p>High concentrations can scorch leaves, especially at higher temperatures. <a>Seedlings</a>, recent <a>transplants</a> and fresh <a>cuttings</a> are especially damage-prone, and should not be treated with soap solutions. Euphorbias and many other <a href="grow_topic.php?subject=cac0">succulents</a>, and Brassicas seem most affected; <a>Begonia</a>, <a>bleeding heart</a>, <a>Impatiens</a>, <a>Rhododendron</a>, <a href="plant.php?en=263&nm=maple">maple</a> and <a href="plant.php?en=418&nm=mountain%20ash">mountain ash</a> are among other sensitive plants. Repeat sprayings are most damaging, and conditioned water may also increase damage.

<p>Spot-treat a small area and observe for 24 hours prior to treating the entire plant, and test on a few plants prior to using it on many.

<p>Commercial offerings, such as Safer's insecticide, are specially formulated, but at least some test data suggests that homebrew is equally effective when used in an appropriate manner. Ivory liquid dishwashing detergent has been studied and found quite effective in this role, at a 1-2% concentration; similar products should also work well. Safer's, however, appears less hard on plants. 

<p>Harsh detergents can do significant damage; beware of regular dishwashing products. Even if damage is not grossly apparently, yields of <i>fruits and vegetables</i> may be reduced.

<p>Finally, soap solutions may be combined with <a>insecticidal oils</a> for greater efficacy. Again, test these solutions on a small area of one plant, first, and use with caution.
6 insecticidal oil insecticides Insecticidal oils or horticultural oils are used against soft-bodied insects: <a>aphids</a>, <a>thrips</a>, <a>mites</a>, young <a>whiteflies</a> and <a>scale</a> insects, larval forms of <a>caterpillars</a> and beetles, and insect eggs. Scheduled applications may help prevent fungal diseases such as <a>powdery mildew</a>, <a>black spot</a> on roses, and some forms of <a>Alternaria leaf spot</a>.

<p>Insecticidal oils block pests' oxygen intake, thus killing them, and are fairly non-selective. They will kill soft-bodied beneficials, but have no residual toxicity.

<p>Insecticidal oils may be used on dormant plants before buds open, or in spring or summer on plants in leaf.

<p>Refined mineral oil sprays or horticultural oils are available commercially, and are specially formulated for insect control. Typically, these are petroleum-derived products, and as such only the ultra-purified versions (known also as ultra-refined or superior oils) can be used when plants are in leaf - older dormant oils contained plant- and animal-toxic impurities.

<p>These purified oils are safe to humans, even if used on <a>fruits, vegetables</a>, or <a>herbs</a> treated with them. Insecticidal oils break down quickly.

<p>As with <a>insecticidal soaps</a>, <i>insecticidal oils can damage plants.</i>

<p>Spot-treat small areas and observe for 24 hours prior to treating entire plants, and test on a few plants prior to treating many.

<p>A mixture of ordinary vegetable oil and liquid soap, mixed 15:1, may be used as an alternative to commercial preparations. Dilute such mixtures further, about 20:1, and spray to control various pests. Because these oils are less miscible in water, and form larger particles, they do not spray as well or as evenly.

<p>Mixed with sodium bicarbonate - one good tablespoon of baking soda, one tablespoon of insectical oil per 4 litres or 1 gallon of water - can be used as an effective preventative for fungal disease. It is, however, not a true fungicide - it does work against existing infections.

<p>Some plants, especially non-woody species, do not take well to being sprayed with these solutions. Ferns and <a>walnut</a> trees should not be treated with insecticidal oils. <a>Seedlings</a>, recent <a>transplants</a> and fresh <a>cuttings</a> should not be treated, nor should drought-stressed plants. Ideally, plants should be <a>watered</a> or <a>irrigated</a> prior to application.

<p>Spray on a calm, cool, cloudy day; the oil should dry before sun reaches treated plants, as the oil can act as a magnifying lens and cause burn damage. Temperatures should be above freezing and below 30C/86F; avoid foggy or very high-humidity days. Treat all parts of the plant. Use insecticidal oils at recommended concentrations and rates. Agitate the oil-and-water mixture frequently to keep the oil evenly in suspension. Do not use within a month of using sulfur-based products.
7 pyrethrins insecticides Derived from <a>Chrysanthemum</a> species, pyrethrins are organic insecticides that highly toxic to both insects and fish. They will kill both harmful and beneficial insects. Pyrethrins are much less toxic to mammals, especially compared to most synthetic insecticides. They are fully biodegradeable, break down fairly quickly in light and heat, and as such should be applied in early evening.

<p>Despite their overall safety, pyrethins can still have an irritant effect in humans. A correlation between pyrethrin use during pregnancy and autism has been found, though there is no proof that one actually caused the other. Still, organic does not always mean safe, and caution is advised.

<p>Note that artificial analogues, so-called pyrethroids, which includes permethrin, are also used as insecticides. Pyrethrins may also be mixed with other synthetics: preparations may not be fully organic, or not at all.
8 rotenone insecticides Like <a>neem</a> oil and <a>pyrethrins</a>, rotenone is plant-derived <a>insecticide</a>. Like pyrethrins, rotenone is highly toxic to insects and fish. Unlike pyrethrins, it is also moderately toxic to birds and mammals including humans. Because pure rotenone is organic, it can be used on organically-grown <a>fruits and vegetables</a>, but that does not imply safety. It is simply natural, non-synthetic. In large doses, it is toxic, even fatal; some human deaths have followed deliberate ingestion of large amounts. Rotenone also causes Parkinson's disease in rats; it may increase the Parkinson's risk in humans.

<p>Beware also that rotenone preparations may be mixed with synthetic and more toxic pesticides. Read the label; let the buyer beware.

<p>Rotenone is effective against virtually all insect pests, but is also toxic to beneficial insects. Specific target pests include <a>aphids</a>, <a>borers</a>, <a>cabbage worms</a>, <a>caterpillars</a>, <a>codling moths</a>, <a>flea beetles</a>, <a>Japanese beetles</a>, leafhoppers, <a>Mexican bean beetles</a>, <a>sawflies</a>, <a>stinkbugs</a>, <a>thrips</a> and <a>weevils</a>, and many others.

<p>Rotenone breaks down rapidly when exposed to sunlight, and in the garden degrades almost completely within a week. Note that it lasts much longer in water - up to half a year - and that is extremely toxic to fish. Take care to contaminate streams, ponds, or other bodies of water.  

<p>As with all pesticides, rotenone should not be used indiscriminately. It should not be used if not needed, and not within several weeks of harvesting. Beware that commercial forms may also contain synthetics pesticides, which are often considerably more toxic to humans and other mammals. 

<p>Apply in early evening, as per manufacturer's directions, and use adequate protection.
9 pheromone-based traps traps Pheromones are scent-based hormones used by insects to communicate over long distances. Sex pheromones attract mates, and aggregation pheromones attract males and females of that species. Both are used to lure insect pests into <a>traps</a>, and can be very effective. These traps are becoming quite common, and are readily available - often at local garden centres - for such pests as <a>Japanese beetles</a>, <a>corn earworms</a>, and <a>cucumber beetles</a>.
 
<p>Even if your garden centre or favorite garden supplier does not carry a trap specifically for your insect pest, a pheromone-based solution often still exists. The following is an abbreviated list of target pests for which pheromone-based traps can be purchased:

11 sticky traps traps Coloured sticky tape or sticky cards can be useful for a number of pests. Yellow is used for <a href="pest.php?en=2">aphids</a>, <a>whiteflies</a> and <a>fruit flies</a>, <a>cucumber beetles</a>, <a>flea beetles</a> and imported <a>cabbageworms</a>, leafhoppers and leaf miners, <a>onion fly</a> and <a>carrot root fly</a>, and some <a>moths</a>. Yellow traps are typically most effective if hung vertically immediately above plants, though very effective against <a>fungus gnats</a> if laid horizontally across the <a>soil</a>. Unfortunately, yellow traps may also catch beneficial insects such as <a>lady beetles</a>.

<p>Use white sticky traps for <a>flea beetles</a> and <a>tarnished plant bugs</a>. Blue and green can be very effective against <a>thrips</a>; bright blue against <a>leaf miners</a>.

<p>Home-made versions use colored paint on wood, cardboard, or plastic, and are covered in sticky materials, i.e. Tanglefoot for big bugs, thinner products for smaller pests. In addition to commercial preparation, Vaseline and vegetable oils may be used.

<p>It is reasonable to try sticky traps for insect pests not listed here: experiment with the colors listed above. Bright colors appear to work best.

<p>Sticky traps may be used to monitor pest numbers over time, and the efficacy of interventions used. Sticky cards of a defined size can facilitate counting and monitoring. Placed strategically, especially with greenhouses, these may help localize breeding areas and access routes for specific pests. sticky compounds, visual lures
12 nematodes nematodes This large family of small roundworms contains both beneficials and pests. Beneficial nematodes aggressively attack the young of various pest insects, and can persist in the soil for long periods of time. They are sometimes referred to as entomopathogenic nematodes (insect-disease-causing nematodes), or EPNs. Nematodes used for insect pest control are safe for humans and other vertebrates.

<p>Nematodes occur naturally in <a>soil</a>; much greater-than-normal concentrations are required to control serious pest problems. Drying out will kill most nematodes, and as such, they are most effective in moist and shaded locations. Juvenile nematodes actively seek out prey, which they kill within 48 hours; they multiply rapidly in hospitable environments.

<p>Nematodes are small, but large enough to be visible with a magnifying glass, and some adult forms even to the naked eye. They quickly disappear into the soil, not to be seen again. That said, squeamish homeowners may opt for other pest control solutions: let the buyer beware.

<p>Most useful for biological pest control are:

</table>

<p>For lawn-damaging grubs, combinations of Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora are frequently used, and more effective than either species alone.

<p>Nematodes work only on larval forms, and as such, timing the application depends on the life cycle of target pest. <i>Timing is important.</i> For some, this means an application in May or June for many insects, one in August or September for others, and sometimes both. Read the directions.

<p>Nematodes should be used as soon as possible, as time will affect viability. If stored, make sure they are stored per the manufacturer's recommendations; avoid baking in a car, or exposing to freezing temperatures. Post-application, UV <a>light</a>, <a>fertilizers</a>, <a>insecticides</a>, and extreme temperatures can affect viability and effectiveness.

<p>Nematodes are usually sprayed or delivered by <a>irrigation systems</a>, though other formulations and methods may be used. (A watering can, for example, will often work fine.) Follow the directions. 

<p>Apply solutions in late evening, as nematodes require moist, cool and dark conditions to survive. Temperatures should be 13C/55F or higher. Consider aerating densely-packed soil prior to treatment. <a>Water</a> well before the application: this creates a hospitable environment for nematodes, and helps drive pest larvae closer to the soil surface. Water again after application, more lightly, to carry nematodes into the soil, but not hard enough to flush them through it.

<p>Note that nematode species can compete with, and can displace, other beneficial nematodes, though they can also complement native soil nematodes. There is some impact on non-pest beetles and flies, though this appears to be minimal. As with any pest control method, consider pros and cons carefully, use complementary strategies, and use them discriminately.
14 Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki, Bacillus thuringiensis var. san diego Bt pest diseases Bacillus thuringiensis, also referred to as Bt or B.t., is a very common, naturally occuring <a>soil</a> bacterium. It is a natural insecticide, active only against the larvae of certain insects, and safe against even against their adult forms. Various commercial formulations are readily available. 

<p>There are numerous subspecies of Bacillus thuringiensis, each with a different target host, though only a few are widely used. Var. kurstaki is effective against the larvae of most <a>butterflies</a>, <a>moths</a>, and <a>spruce budworm</a>. Var. san diego, also known as Bt var. tenebrionis, is used against <a>Colorado potato beetles</a>. The effect isn't immediate: death takes hours to days. 

<p>Bt is safe against most other organisms, though some beneficials may be effected. Side effects in mammals are possible though very rare and typically minimal.

<p>The timing of the application is important: thoroughly spray all affected plants before adult stages appear, in morning of evening. Bt degrades rapidly after application: it is good only for several days, though will last a year or more on the shelf.

<p>Finally, Bt should not be overused: resistance to Bt has already been reported.

1 Stephanitis pyrioides azalea lace bug insect Lacebugs leave brown splotches on the undersides of <a href="plant.php?en=273&nm=azalea">azalea</a> leaves, and may leave small dots on the surface of leaves; leaves eventually die. Lacebugs don't like shade - moving to partial shade should help fight the problem. Use <a>insecticidal soap</a> or <a>pyrethrin</a> compound early in the season, several applications 4 days apart.
2 family Aphididae aphids insect These small insects come in various colours; all attack leaves and stems of host plants, causing leaves to distort then fall, and covering them in sticky secretion called honeydew; the latter may in turn attract ants which will protect the aphid colonies in return for feeding on this honeydew. A problem with most <a>fruits and vegetables</a>.

<p>Avoid a vegetable problem by starting plants indoors early, hardening off early, setting outside well before last frost, where possible. Pick off affected leaves, or spray with <a>soap</a> or <a>oil</a> solutions. Yellow <a>sticky traps</a> helpful with flying aphids

<p><a>Aphid midge</a> (Aphidoletes aphidimyza), <a>ladybugs</a> or convergent lady beetles (family Coccinellidae), <a>lacewings</a> (Chrysoperla carnea, C. rufilabrus) are all available commercially. <a>Braconid wasps</a> (Aphidius matricariae) are also used to control apple aphids. <a>Pyrethrins</a> and <a>rotenone</a> may be used as a last resort.
3 Rhagoletis pomonella apple maggot insect Small white maggots that tunnel through ripening <a>apples</a>, and cause them to drop prematurely. Destroy fallen, affected <a>fruit</a>. Traps based on <a>pheromone</a> lures are quite effective; typically these are painted red and apple-shaped. Home-made traps of the same size and colour may be covered in glue, for the same effect.


<p>This species is also referred to as railroad worm, though this term is more commonly applied to the larva of an unrelated beetle. railroad worm
4 Delia radicum cabbage maggot, cabbage fly, cabbage root fly insect These small white maggots feed on stems and roots of brassicas including <a>broccoli</a>, <a href="plant.php?en=591&nm=cabbage">cabbage</a>, and <a>cauliflower</a>, a problem that is worst early in spring. May avoid most of the problems by setting these out around the last frost date, and by planting in areas where brassicas haven't grown in the last few years

<p>Parasitic <a>nematodes</a> are commercially available. <a>Wood ashes</a> or <a>diatomaceous</a> earth may deter these pests; metal or cardboard collars surrounding plant stems and roots may help. Make sure no <a>wild mustards</a>, or other brassica-family weeds, grow nearby. Destroy infected plants. Hylemya brassicae
5 order Lepidoptera caterpillars insect Caterpillars belong to a large family that includes <a>cabbage loopers</a>, <a>tent caterpillars</a>, <a>cabbage worms</a>, <a>corn earworms</a>, <a>tomato hornworms</a>, and many other pests.

<p>Hand-picking is the most effective treatment for small infestations. <a>Bacillus thuringiensis</a> var. kurstaki is quite effective. The <a>Trichogramma wasp</a> and <a>tachinid flies</a> are available commercially; other wasps also can be very effective. Using various <a>sticky compounds</a> i.e. Tanglefoot on bark of trees can prevent them from reaching the fruit. <a>Lures</a> are now available to attract <a>spined soldier bugs</a>, Podisus maculiventris, a natural predator of many caterpillar species, as well as the bug itself. <a>Pyrethrins</a> can be used as a last resort. cabbage looper, tent caterpillar, cabbage worm, tomato hornworm
6 Leptinotarsa decemlineata Colorado potato beetle insect Shiny, striped, and yellow to orange, these beetles defoliate <a href="plant.php?en=666&nm=potato">potato</a> plants. Planting 1 to 2 weeks later than usual may be helpful. Smaller problems easily handled with a vacuum cleaner, or pick and destroy adults and larvae by hand. <a>Spined soldier bugs</a>, Podisus maculiventris, are commercially available predators; lures to attract it also exist. <a>Bacillus thuringiensis</a> var. san diego effective, as are some <a>tachinid flies</a>. Spray with <a>neem</a>, <a>pyrethrins</a>, <a>rotenone</a>, if other measures fail.
7 family Pyralidae corn borers insect Whitish <a>caterpillars</a> with black dots that tunnel their way through stalks of <a href="plant.php?en=674&nm=corn">corn</a>. Rotate crops, destroy cornstalks after harvest. <a>Bacillus thuringiensis</a> var. kurstaki, and <a>tachinid flies</a> are commercially available organic options.
8 Helicoverpa zea corn earworm insect Another <a>caterpillar</a>, this one destroying ears of <a href="plant.php?en=674&nm=corn">corn</a>. Plant or set out corn as early as possible - using an early variety. <a>Pheromone-based traps</a> may be useful. <a>Bacillus thuringiensis</a> var. kurstaki is effective, but can be hard to apply; <a>Trichogramma wasps</a> are also effective. A <a>pathogenic virus</a> marketed as Elcar is available in some countries. <a>Spined soldier bugs</a> may be effective, and can be purchased or lured into the garden.
9 family Noctuidae cutworms insect Larvae are fat, gray or brown in color, about 1 1/2" long, feed during the night and spend the day underground. They feed on tender shoots, cutting them off at or below ground level.

<p>A friendly <a>toad</a> can help with the problem, as can certain <a>nematodes</a> including <a>Steinernema carpocapsae</a>, and <a>tachinid flies</a>; the latter may be available commercially. Protect young plants with cardboard or metal collars at their bases. hand-picking at night can reduce numbers. Finally, the kurstaki strain of <a>Bacillus thuringiensis</a> can be mixed with bran and molasses and spread over the <a>soil</a> to kill them.
10 Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium and Phytophtora species, and other fungi damping&nbsp;off fungus Caused by a number of soil-borne fungi found in moist <a>soils</a>, this common affliction causes <a>seedling</a> stems to pinch off at their bases, so that seedlings topple and die. Using sterilized soils for seedlings, and avoiding cool, moist conditions helps avoid this problem.

bookcase Custom built-in bookcases PD These bookcases are based on some I once saw in a medieval library, in Prague - bookcases that stretched from ground to ceiling, but with an extra-wide lower shelf that served as deep storage as well as seating. Those were plain white. These are red oak and Japanese ash, and feature a mix of custom and purchased moldings. custom bookcases, built-in, oak, Japanese ash Built-in bookcases with seats I built a few years ago - 

Materials: oak, oak ply, MDF, japanese ash veneer ($17 on eBay!!), Old Masters golden oak stain, satin polyurethane sanded to 600-grit, Clapham's furniture wax. Done, of course, on my BT3000, though I've swapped out the router for a Bosch 1617EVS.

<center><img src="projects/bookcase_101.jpg" alt="custom built-in bookcases, oblique view"></center>  

<center><img src="projects/bookcase_131.jpg" alt="custom built-in bookcases, front view"></center> 

<center><img src="projects/bookcase_111.jpg" alt="custom bookcase, figured Japanese ash panel detail"></center> 

Learning to veneer on something as open-grained as Japanese ash: bleed-through was awful. Still, it was a great experience, and I think the results look great, as well.

<center><img src="projects/bookcase_201.jpg" hspace=10 alt="built-in corner bookcase with seat, oblique view"><img src="projects/bookcase_212.jpg" hspace=10 alt="built-in corner bookcase with seat, front view"></center>  

<center><img src="projects/bookcase_222.jpg" alt="corner built-in bookcase, Japanese ash panel detail"></center> 

I'd never thought or intended to mix ash with oak - but I did want something special. The inspiration for this piece was a classic walnut bookcase I first spotted in Today's Woodworker (issue 52, 1997) but that I've seen in other magazines since; walnut burl veneer was used between the rosettes. So I checked eBay (search: veneer), lost a bid on some bosse burl veneer (fortunately) and this popped up:

<center><img src="projects/tamo_figured_ash.jpg" alt="Tamo or Japanese ash veneer"></center>

Color looked right, figure was beautiful, and it had a really lustrous quality - the one above is the worst of the batch of 8 sheets!

Of course, I didn't know how well it would work until I stained and finished a small piece ... but at $17 for the batch, well, if it didn't work I'd use it for something else.

I did a little research, learned ash is very much like red oak: (usually) straight-grained, open grain, relatively the same density, workability, and finishes well.

Veneering was a bit of a pain, and I also learned that Tamo veneer does not like to be sanded, especially against the grain: made a fuzzy, hairy mess. I almost lost one panel, but careful work with a sharp cabinet scraper fixed it.

For those interested: I decided not to mess with hide glue (but might in the future, with open-grained woods - bleed-through's probably easier to correct), and used BetterBond veneer glue from <a href="http://www.veneersupplies.com/">VeneerSupplies.com</a>. It *did* work, though the post-glue work was more than I would have liked. I highly recommend Joe, and his web site, to anyone interested in veneering.

Also, my gratitude to Kirby Gaal (derwood7 on eBay - and yes, he's still actively selling on eBay) for his beautiful veneer and excellent service. You should see the Claro walnut and mappa burl I picked up for almost nothing!
coffee_table Coffee table/chest PD A combination chest/coffee table built from red oak and finished with wrought-iron hardware, square-cut nails, and flaps stays to prevent lid-slam injury. coffee table, red oak My first big project, following the purchase of my Ryobi BT3000 table saw/router table, some ten years ago, was this chest/coffee table.

<center><img src="projects/coffee_table_1.jpg" alt="oak coffee table, oblique view"></center>  

The coffee table was built from locally-obtained red oak. It was finished using Old Masters golden oak stain, satin polyurethane sanded to 600-grit, and Clapham's furniture wax.

The basic design is my own. I made mistakes, of course. The sides are joined using butt joints - and gluing end grain to long grain results in an inherently weak joint. 

<center><img src="projects/coffee_table_7.jpg" alt="oak coffee table, oblique view showing edges reinforced with square-cut nails"></center>  

As the pictures show, the edges have been nailed, with ornamental square-cut wrought-head nails. This adds a little reinforcement, but not much. Were I to do this project over again, I would either dovetail these edges, or use dowels, biscuits, or screws to reinforce the joint. To avoid splitting the end grain, I drilled pilot holes - something you'd also need to do if you were using screws.

<center><img src="projects/coffee_table_4.jpg" alt="oak coffee table, side/top view, side boards joined by glued edge joints"></center>  

Sides were glued up from narrower boards: glued edge joints are very stronger than the boards they join. My BT3000 table saw is fantastic - boards ripped so clean, no edge-jointing was required.

Another lesson learned: checks and knots may make for interesting details (and I still enjoy including them, where appropriate), but do not get paste wax into them! Wax becomes transparent once buffed to a clear soft sheen - but remains a very obvious, incongruous, undesirable filler if stuck where it can't be buffed.

<center><img src="projects/coffee_table_5.jpg" alt="oak coffee table, top and end view showing check in wood"></center>  

The oxidized antique steel-and-iron hardware shown above came from Lee Valley, at <a href="http://www.leevalley.com/">www.leevalley.com</a>. So did the flap stays below, the final necessary detail - without them, the chest lids slam down with enough force to do major damage to little fingers. For long, heavy lids like the ones on this project, be sure to use one on each side.

<center><img src="projects/coffee_table_8.jpg" alt="chest/coffee table, with flap stays to prevent the slamming of very heavy chest lids onto little fingers"></center>
bow_saw Hand-crafted bow saw PD The bow saw or frame saw is the historical version of a band saw. It excels at cutting curves; its long strokes cut faster and more evenly than a coping saw. This one, made of ash, is as fun to use as it was to build. It's also cheaper, quieter, takes far less space, and safer than a band saw. bow saw, frame saw, turning saw The bow saw, turning saw, or frame saw is the previous century's version of a band saw.  It excels at cutting curves; the blade allows for long strokes that cut much faster and more evenly than a coping saw. Normally, you wouldn't be able to push such a long, thin blade through wood.

The blade can be turned to any angle. This means it can be used to resaw material from boards much longer than the saw is deep - simply angle the body of the saw away from the cutting plane.

<center><img src="projects/bow_saw_1.jpg" alt="The bow saw utilizes a long, thin blade to facilitate the cutting of sharp curves"></center>  

The bow saw, however, tensions the blade such that it handles thick stock with ease - the saw shown made short work of 2" stock. It could probably handle thicker; I just haven't tried it yet.

This particular bow saw has largely been adapted from Hasluck's The Handyman's Book (1854) and from plans in a 1920s issue of The Woodworker.

<center><img src="projects/bow_saw_2.jpg" alt="A hand made bow saw offers the ability to cut complex curves easily and quickly"></center>  

The frame is the key to the bow saw blade's rigidity in use. The two arms or cheeks are separated by a crosspiece or stretcher. Brass pins project from the handles, through the lower arms; a saw blade can easily be slipped into the grooved pins of the untensioned saw.

The upper arms of the saws are joined by several loops of cord wrapped around them, as shown. A tensioning toggle sits between these loops, and is turned to shorten this cord and draw the upper saw arms together. This in turn draws the lower arms apart (with the stretcher as fulcrum), which tensions the blade.

<center><a href="sketchup.php?ski=bow_saw_3.jpg"><img src="SketchUp/bow_saw_3.jpg" alt="Google SketchUp design of a hand-made bow saw"></a></center>  

Use strong but light cord: too much and the toggle becomes hard to turn. Way too much, and the saw becomes top-heavy and unbalanced. I used five loops of waxed whipping cord. I like the look, and it's plenty strong.

Be careful, also, not to over-tighten the toggle, or you'll cause the blade to fail prematurely.

Blades can be custom-made, in which case, you'll need to pin or rivet them between the brass pins. Or they can be purchased - on on-line source I like is <a href="http://www.toolsforworkingwood.com/Merchant/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=toolshop&Category_Code=CGT">Gramercy Tools</a> - they offer blades, pins, handles, even completed saws.

A final note on the two handles. I prefer two different handles, though many designs use the same handle style on each end. Too confusing: <i>most blades are meant to cut in only one direction</i>. You can't cut with one hand on each handle, not effectively. Only one of my two handles is used to work the saw - the larger one. Use the second handle to orient the blade at the same angle as that used by the blade-and-pin at the long handle.

Two references: more about the <a href="sketchup.php?image=bow_saw_3.jpg">Google SketchUp model of a bow saw</a> shown above, with download link, to use or adapt as you see fit. And BugBear's bow saw page at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/plybench/bowsaw.html">http://www.geocities.com/plybench/bowsaw.html</a> showcases some lovely bow saws, and features many useful links.

That's about 4" less than I would like for myself, though even for me (at 5' 7"), it's great for cutting, planing, etc. Length is half that of the adult bench; the other measurements are approximately 2/3 of the bigger bench.

<p>The top consists of a double layer of 3/4" MDF. This would appear to defy tradition and shocks purists. Still, traditional benches were constructed from what was ready-at-hand and inexpensive. MDF is cheap, easy to work with, and nice and heavy. Finally, I would rather have a bench that bruises, should a workpiece fall onto the bench, than a workpiece that's damaged while the workbench remains unscarred.

<p>Also very non-traditional: the convertible shoulder/tail vise. The shoulder vise consists of a block of poplar and MDF that slides on two recessed 8" heavy duty drawer slides. Slide the block in fully and you have a full-length tail or end vise. Both are operated by the same screw.

<p>Add 3/4" dog holes spaced 6" apart in the workbench top, with matching holes in the vise jaws, and the options for securing workpieces are endless.

<p>Great bench. My kids have done a good part of the assembly. They're justifiably proud of it. 

<p>And it's become my favorite bench, and will be until I finish the full-sized version.

43c60599fea83e6a66a8226b10368f67 Ryobi_BT3000_table_saw Ryobi BT3000 combination table saw/router table PD A basic but good scale model of the Ryobi BT3000 table saw/router table - a very sweet combination tool with many ardent aficionados. Ryobi BT3000, combination table saw router table The Ryobi BT3000 combination table saw/router table, like many such combination devices, especially those produced at a relatively low price point, is easy to dismiss. Nor is the Ryobi name one to suggest a top-of-the-line product. Ryobi tends to produce reasonable, reliable products at reasonable prices.

<p>Fortunately, there are exceptions, and this product is one such - purchased on a whim, almost eight years ago. The tablesaw is fantastic. My first boards ripped so clean, no edge-jointing was required. Often, they still do; when they don't, usually the wood or the blade are to blame. The mitre gauge looks unconventional, but is wonderfully accurate. The router table is decent, though I use it with a Bosch EVS1617 rather than the original Ryobi router which, with a 1/4" collet only, doesn't handle the heavy stuff.

<p>This is not the place for a full product review. I will refer the unconvinced to <a href="http://www.BT3Central.com">BT3Central.com</a>, a web site devoted to fans - many of them hard-core woodworking enthusiasts - of this product. The image gallery alone should convince that this is fine woodworking tool.

<p>Anyways, the reason for the SketchUp model: I hope, in the next few years, to build a new shop. Part of the fun is in the design - and while I could use a ruler and grid paper, I would rather design the whole thing in SketchUp. Lay out the larger tools, the benches, dust collection, doors and windows, etc.

<p>This may seem more work than necessary - but if you can download the models, like this one, it becomes very easy to populate the shop. You need not worry about sizing the models. You easily change the layout, and visualize the whole thing in 3D. And you can design the shop, and create the plans, directly and easily in SketchUp. http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=43c60599fea83e6a66a8226b10368f67 <iframe src="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/mini?mid=43c60599fea83e6a66a8226b10368f67" width="400" height="300" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" frameborder="0"></iframe> Ryobi_BT3000_tablesaw6.jpg Ryobi_BT3000_tablesaw6_thumb.gif
e0f94ab9a0c75b74f6000ea0063673d5 bow_saw Bow saw, turning saw, or frame saw PD The bow saw, turning saw, or frame saw is history's version of a band saw. It cuts smooth curves and tight radii; the blade allows for long strokes that cut faster and more evenly than a coping saw. Plus, it's fun to build and fun to use. bow saw, turning saw, frame saw This is a SketchUp model of a bow saw, also referred to as a turning or frame saw. (Although a frame saw can also be something completely different.) The bow saw cuts smooth curves and tight radii; the blade allows for long strokes that cut faster and more evenly than a coping saw. 

<p>This particular model is based on a mix of designs, especially Hasluck's The Handyman's Book (1854) and from plans in a 1920s issue of The Woodworker.

<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1/woodwork/project.php?art=bow_saw"><img src="projects/bow_saw_2.jpg" alt="A hand made bow saw offers the ability to cut complex curves easily and quickly" class="img_main" width=300 height=297></a>Of course, no model is as good as its real-world execution, so I've posted images and text in the <a href="http://127.0.0.1/woodwork/project.php?art=bow_saw">related project article</a>.

<p>About the SketchUp model itself: it looks deceptively simple. The arms, in particular, were quite difficult, especially for a SketchUp beginner. One of the images below is of just one of the arms, and a second links to a nifty image of the wireframe structure of the arm, which depicts the handle, pin and crosspiece that interact with it as solid object.

<p>Creating an arm of uniform thickness but with the curved shapes did not take too long and wasn't too difficult. Create the basic outline, then "Push" it out to half the thickness of the arm.

<p>Putting a taper on the upper arm <i>was</i> difficult, but then, I think I went about it wrong. I created a plane through the arm, intended to become the new tapered outer surface of the arm. Intersected the plane with the model. And yes, it should work - but it created a number of areas that simply did not fill. A model with many tricky holes, lines that weren't quite on-plane. Took forever to fix.

<p>In retrospect, I'd try the Scale Tool, and drag only the one upper outer edge down to create the taper I'd want. I suspect that would work. Quickly and easily.

<p>Next, the chamfer. I created a 45<sup>o</sup> triangle to subtract from all edges I wanted chamfered, and used the Follow Me tool. Same problem occurred: SketchUp couldn't create perfect-fit matches along an angled, curved edge. Some places didn't remove the chamfer. Others had holes where faces and edges ought to be. Again, these had to be fixed manually. Took a long time.

<p>The rest of the arm was easy. I had a half-arm. I copied it, flipped it, joined the two halves into a whole. Added the mortise and the through-hole for the pins. And copied and flipped the arm, to make a second.

<p>The crosspiece is as easy as it looks. Simple elongated rectangle, with short tenon protruded from either end, and a simple chamfer using the Follow Me tool that worked.

<p>The handles are extremely easy - more about them, later. Pins and saw blade, easy. String, finicky but not hard.

<p>Was it worth it? For me, yes. I enjoyed designing the thing. I had fun building it. And I love using it - the saw works beautifully. http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=e0f94ab9a0c75b74f6000ea0063673d5 <iframe src="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/mini?mid=e0f94ab9a0c75b74f6000ea0063673d5" width="400" height="300" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" frameborder="0"></iframe> bow_saw_3.jpg bow_saw_3_thumb.jpg
43cf791a10ddc04f108986f20784479f spiral_threaded_bolt Spiral-threaded bolt toolkit PD Components for creating true spiral-threaded bolts and machine screws of many sizes and styles: hex head, flanged hex head, round head, button head. Slotted and square drive head, with or without a smooth shank. Includes matching hex nut and washer. spiral-thread bolt, machine screw, hex head, hex nut, washer This particular article is part a how-to guide, part an homage to the truly amazing things that SketchUp does rather easily.

<p>&nbsp;

<br clear="all">
<p>For several projects now, I've wanted realistic, spiral-threaded bolts - not the concentric-ring facsimiles I've been able to download from the Warehouse.

<p>More - I wanted different sizes and lengths and styles of bolts.

<p>That's what lead to my "bolt template". Mix and match components, resize them, and you can build any spiral-threaded bolt you want.

<p>The components are based on a standard 1/4" bolt with 20 threads-per-inch (tpi) design, but you can adapt them to anything you want.

<p>In this example, I'll be "building" a 3/8" bolt with 16 tpi, 5" length, for a <a href="sketchup.php?model=kids_workbench">kids' workbench</a> I've been working on.

<p><img src="SketchUp/bolt_finished.gif" style="float:left;width:385px;height:590px;margin:0 15px 0 10px" alt='finished 3/8" by 5" hex bolt, created in SketchUp' title='finished 3/8" by 5" hex bolt, created in SketchUp'>

<p>First, I re-save the file "bolt toolkit" to the unique name of what I'm building. I don't want to destroy the original bolt template file.

<br clear="all">
<p>Next, select your components. It's a hex-head bolt, so that's the head I want. I delete the others. Multi-select with Shift-Click or Ctrl-Click (I prefer Shift-Click, as a second Shift-Click will unselect the same item, if I need it to).

<p><img src="SketchUp/bolt_head_deletes.gif" style="float:left;width:600px;height:351px;margin:0 15px 0 10px" alt="use Shift-Click to select SketchUp components to delete" title="use Shift-Click to select SketchUp components to delete">

<p>Hit delete.

<br clear="all">
<p>This bolt has a 4" length of smooth shank. I need that. Plus a shank-to-spiral transition piece:

<p>These, you'll want to keep.

<br clear="all">
<p>Finally, I'll want the main bolt spiral component, and the end spiral piece. Additionally, I'll want to keep the matching washer and nut.

<p>&nbsp;

<br clear="all">
<p>Materials are spruce and a double layer of 3/4" of MDF for the top; I know, hardly traditional. Though traditional benches were typically built with what was readily and (usually) cheaply available, and here, that's spruce and MDF. I also used 3/4" poplar for the construction of the shoulder vise section, and for the casing around it.

<p>I considered maple - also available here, though not cheap. I prefer spruce and MDF for their advantages: cheap, easy to work with, and, <i>if a workpiece bangs into the bench, I want the bench to bruise</i>. Not the workpiece. The workbench should bear the scars.

<p>A workbench should be solid, versalite, strong. This one meets all criteria.

<p>Overall, this bench is a 2/3 scale approximation of an adult version I'm building, except in length. Length is 1/2 of the adult bench.

<p>Dog holes are spaced at 6" intervals, as with the adult version. Extremely useful.

<p style="font-size:11px;margin:20px 100px">(I know, looks kind of undersized. Short. But it measures 27" from the ground, and while that's about 4" shorter than I would like for myself, it's still very useable. Planing, cutting, etc. - it's my favorite bench, and will be until the adult version is finished.)
</center>

<p>The <a href="project.php?art=kids_workbench">final result - great bench</a>. My kids love it; they're very proud of it. I love it - I clamp a workpiece, I cut or plane, not a quiver in the work. Hand-cutting is quick and effortless. Who'd have thought?

<p>Bench screws are from Busy Bee Tools (SketchUp model for these is available separately in the 3D Warehouse). The spiral-threaded hex bolts used to secure the legs I created using my <a href="sketchup.php?model=spiral_threaded_bolt">bolt creation toolkit</a>.

<p>Finally, I cheated on the shoulder vise. It's secured to the bench using two 8" heavy duty drawer slides. Still, this gives you two ways to use this vise - as a proper shoulder vise, or as a full-length tail vise.

<p>Besides these, a handful of screws were used in the construction. No nails were harmed in the production of the piece.

<p>I will be posting the adult version, later, when I have finished it. http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=d12a82a469b32732108986f20784479f <iframe src="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/mini?mid=d12a82a469b32732108986f20784479f" width="400" height="300" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" frameborder="0"></iframe> kids_workbench_side_above.jpg kids_workbench_side_above_thumb.gif
0 spiral_threaded_bolt2 Spiral-threaded bolt, Part 2: Assembling the spiral PD We show you how to create a custom-sized spiral thread in SketchUp using our free spiral-threaded bolt toolkit model. spiral thread, bolt, machine screw The threaded part of the bolt is trickiest, so I do it first. I start with my "shoulder" or shank-to-spiral transition piece.

1 spiral_threaded_bolt3 Spiral-threaded bolt, Part 3: Resizing and scaling the thread components PD We show you how to create custom-sized bolt in Google SketchUp using our spiral-threaded bolt toolkit. In this example, we resize and rescale to create a 3/8-inch bolt with 16 tpi from a 1/4-inch bolt with 20 tpi. resize, scale, bolt, threads per inch, tpi Getting the bolt dimensions right involves both resizing and scaling operations. In this example, we're converting the standard, 1/4-inch bolt with 20 threads per inch into a 3/8-inch bolt with 16 tpi.

<p>We start with the bolt diameter. Using the Tape Measure tool, measure the diameter of the bolt shank - 1/4 inch, by default.

<p><img src="SketchUp/SketchUp_tape_measure.png" style="width:549px;height:535px;margin:0 15px 0 10px" alt="resizing a cylinder in SketchUp: measure across its diameter" title="resizing a cylinder in SketchUp: measure across its diameter">

<p>Now, simply type in the new, desired diameter. In this case, we type "3/8" (again, minus the quotation marks) and hit Enter.

<p><img src="SketchUp/SketchUp_Value_Control_Box_length.png" style="width:208px;height:28px;margin:0 15px 0 10px" alt="enter a new value in the Value Control Box, and select Enter" title="enter a new value in the Value Control Box, and select Enter">

<p>Unfortunately, while the bolt diameter is right, the thread pitch is not. Still, getting to 16 threads per inch is not difficult.

<p>Use the Tape Measure tool to draw a line parallel to the bolt, starting from the top of the thread, and extending a little past the bolt.

<p><img src="SketchUp/bolt_thread_guideline.png" style="width:379px;height:529px;margin:0 15px 0 10px" alt="draw a guide line starting at the start of the bolt thread, parallel to it, and just past it" title="draw a guide line starting at the start of the bolt thread, parallel to it, and just past it">

<p>This creates a Guide or guide line. Type 1 and Enter to resize it to 1 inch long. This should be somewhat closer to the top of the bolt than where the thread currently ends.

<p>To resize the threaded part of the bolt only in its length - leaving its diameter unchanged - use the Scale tool. Select all thread segments, minus the Guide line.

<p>Left-click on the closer desired control point, and drag it up until the bottom of the thread lines up with the end of the Guide line. <b>Tip:</b> drag the control point onto the end of the Guide line, and the end of your selection should snap exactly even with this line. Release.

hand_brace The hand brace, or bit and brace PD Perhaps the hand brace - an old, quaint, niche tool - seems an odd choice to feature as the first in a series of favorite tool reviews. But it is truly a favorite. It outperforms the hottest new rechargeable drills in driving heavy screws. It rapidly drives heavy lag bolts. Hand brace and auger bits reliably drill deep holes, faster than a Forstner or saw-tooth bit. Above all, it's fun to use. hand brace, brace and bit, drill The hand brace (also known as brace, brace and bit, brace drill) has become something of a quaint, niche tool.

It is also one of my favorites.

<center><img src="tools/hand_brace.jpg" hspace=10 alt="The hand brace, brace, or brace drill"></center>  

Axial pressure is applied to the rounded handle at the end - no death grip required, just enough that the bit properly engages the workpiece. The centre grip works the U-shaped crank. Power comes mostly from the chest and upper arm muscles: a hand brace generates substantial torque. Both grips rotate freely; no hand or wrist movement is involved. 

<center><img src="tools/hand_brace_2.jpg" hspace=10 alt="The hand brace, brace, or brace drill"></center>  

Most hand braces also feature a gear release that turns the brace into a ratchet-driven device, ideal for situations where full 360-degree crank rotation just doesn't work. A sixty-degree arc is sufficient to work the brace.

The hand brace excels at a few specific tasks. Its ability to drive #12 or #14 screws puts rechargeable drills to shame: you'll suck both batteries dry in very little time. With a screwdriver bit in a hand brace, you'll still be driving dozens of screws, deep, without breaking a sweat.

Similarly, with a socket adapter, a hand brace will drive nuts and lag bolts (oh yes) and even wheel studs faster than any non-ratchet wrench. I find the motion far more natural, easier. I generate more torque, and am far less likely to slip than I am with a wrench.

<center><img src="tools/hand_brace_3a.jpg" hspace=10 alt="Hand brace with socket driver on an adapter bit: great for driving nuts and bolts"><img src="tools/socket_driver_0a.jpg" hspace=10 alt="Adapter bit and socket driver"></center>  

Last, and not least, the main reason I suspect the hand brace has not faded into obscurity as yet: nothing does a better job of drilling with auger bits. Nothing.

The reason is simple - auger bits have knife-sharp edges, or flutes, that easily burn if overheated, and permanently lose their temper. <i>This can happen even at hand-driven speeds</i>. Use one in a hand-held drill, and you will drive it too fast. 

<center><img src="tools/auger_bit_2.jpg" hspace=10 alt="An auger bit, showing sharp fluted edges, lead screw and a leading scoring spur"></center>  

Auger bits will also catch and bind on the wood they're boring - and this can break them if using a power drill. (The scoring spur and lead screw are especially breakage-prone.) A power drill does not allow you to sense this until it's too late. Use a hand brace, and you feel it bind - stop, and reverse. Fixing the problem. Easy. Nothing beats the tactile feedback you get from a brace.

Auger bits aren't in common use, of course. Use them for deep holes in softwoods or green hardwoods, or in MDF - its far easier to drill straight if drilling freehand, and far faster than using saw-tooth or Forstner bits. 

<center><img src="tools/auger_bit.jpg" hspace=10 alt="Auger bits excel at rapidly drilling deep, straight holes in softwoods, green hardwood, and MDF"></center>  

I love auger bits in a hand brace for drilling dog holes on workbenches - very quick, very easy. No trying to maneuver long slabs of wood under a drill press. It's very satisfying to take the low-tech, no-noise route when building a traditional bench.

It's actually fun. 

Just don't use them on a seasoned hardwood top. You've been warned.

bow_saw Hand-crafted bow saw PD The bow saw or frame saw is the historical version of a band saw. It excels at cutting curves; its long strokes cut faster and more evenly than a coping saw. This one, made of ash, is as fun to use as it was to build. It's also cheaper, quieter, takes far less space, and safer than a band saw. bow saw 1
wooden_try_plane The wooden try or jointer plane PD My new, really old wooden try plane, aka jointer plane. It required tuning, fixing an uneven bed, but now works well. wooden plane, try plane, jointer plane, bed The wooden try plane:

<center><img src="tools/wooden_try_plane.jpg" hspace=10 alt="Wooden try or jointer plane"></center>  

I've been reading about planes (looking at you, Chris Schwartz), and have been using my block plane for years. My low-angle jack plane, for about a year. Starting to get the hang of it. I enjoy it. I like hand tools. They're fun, they feel good.

But - as many others have found - crappy equipment makes for a terrible experience.

Jointers, however, are expensive, and occupy precious room. And I just happen to have a bunch of wooden planes I've picked up at garage sales for next-to-nothing. Turns out, that's what they're worth. These planes are eye candy, nothing more.

Except, happily, for the plane above.

I've gotten reasonably good at sharpening. Not as good as the authors of sharpening-is-easy articles in glossy woodworking magazines seem to imply, but good enough now that my planes are useable, and my chisels work well. Good enough that I tried to make my wooden planes work.

Turns out that most of my planes have horribly pitted, nasty blades and irons. Not salvageable. But I've learned what to look for.

All but one had an uneven sole. Fixable, sure. But when there's substantial twist, ask yourself if it's worth it. You'll widen the mouth considerably when you flatten the sole - probably warrants a new sole if you remove enough wood, and else a mouth insert.

I've discovered that I can joint an edge, but I'm not good enough yet with a plane to flatten the sole of another. Some use sandpaper on a backing board - should work. I haven't tried it. Beware of any grit that may imbed in the sole, if you do.

Miraculously, that lovely 24" plane, just the right length for a try or jointer, turned out to have a perfectly flat sole. It's seen decades of neglect, and could be a century old or more. And it's flat.

So I fit the blade, wedged it, and learned to adjust it. Tap, tap, tap. Tap the strike button. Tap, tap. Blade again. Strike button. Blade. Strike button. Blade.

Got the grip. Took my first cut. Some short curls, and some nasty chatter. A few more passes, and I'd chewed up the edge of the wood worse than a beaver with a toothache.

I did what I always do when stymied: stop. I was pretty sure this was not how it was meant to work. What I did not know is whether this was me - my utter lack of grace and finesse - or the tool.

So I stared. Staring at a problem doesn't always make things better, but it's a trusty part of my routine.

The mouth opening *looked* okay. About 1/16" wide, should be okay for a fairly fine shaving. I think. I am, after all, a handplane rookie.

But maybe, maybe, it looked a little uneven. I pulled out the blade. Not quite an even rectangle; it seemed the bed side of the opening was not quite straight. I had read about this - if the bed's uneven, the blade is not evenly supported. Makes sense it could chatter.

The straight-edge confirmed that the bed was off. Damn.

None of the reading I'd done told me how to fix this problem. I had a pretty good idea, however, that just randomly cutting at the bed could turn a potentially decent plane into firewood.

Fortunately, Google rescued me. It seems ironic that something as modern as the Internet could actually save ancient crafts from extinction, but it's possible. It's helped me. Bob from Logan's Cabinet Shoppe showed me how to <a href="http://logancabinetshoppe.com/blog/2013/02/troubleshooting-wooden-plane-problems/">troubleshoot a wooden plane</a>, then <a href="http://logancabinetshoppe.com/blog/2010/12/episode-30/">how to fix the bed</a>. I don't know if using a lit candle is traditional, but it worked beautifully. Though I did use a milled-tooth file in addition to a chisel, with a beautifully smooth, flat bed as result.

It worked. 

Blade back in. Wedge in. Few taps to adjust.

Beautiful curls of wood.
