1 1 Why did you decide to call it ''Savage''? Isn't that rather an aggressive name for an aircraft? Because it stems from a ''pure'' passion for a type of flying that is easy-going, calm and goes against the current trend. Today the market is oriented towards low-wing designs, side-by-side seating and front-wheel tricycle undercarriages. The Savage rebels against that approach and challenges it! Don't forget that this plane can really land in wild and remote areas. See our videos or the special accessories list, and you will understand why we consider our product really ''savage''. It is definitely all about the ownership and exciting flying experience that you get with it, which is really Savage! You get really involved and in love with this aircraft… And it is also about the “savage” places you can reach with it, which cannot even count as emergency places for landing with other aircrafts.

2 2 How does the Savage handle? Inspired by one of the timeless legends of aviation, the Piper Cub, it consequently features many of its characteristics: excellent STOL performance, superb all-round visibility (even downwards with the optional transparent flooring), comfort, good handling and easy emergency landing thanks to its tough undercarriage and a ''flare'' at around 65 km/h. Much slower if equipped with our Vortex generators Kit, which today comes actually as a standard. Fast-steep climb rate and cruise performance are excellent thanks to contained weight and a low-drag cross-section. It is, then, a reasonably fast cruise machine that is also at home on small airfields with difficult, obstructed approaches. How does the Savage handle?

3 3 What are the real difficulties with a ''taildragger'' undercarriage? A lot has been said about this: that it is difficult during taxiing because forward visibility is impaired, that propeller torque is difficult to contrast on take-off, that landing requires expert skills, that it is easy to flip over and is unmanageable in crosswinds and so on. These statements are often made by pilots with no direct experience of this type of aircraft who do not distinguish between different versions. Of course, pilots flying ''taildragger'' aircraft must always be fully aware of their particular characteristics because, on the one hand, while they require only short runways to give secure off-field landings, they do, on the other, require greater precision. With the Savage a pilot who is 1.65 m tall can see ahead perfectly without having to zigzag. Special devices which limit the effects of torque mean it is no longer necessary to ''pedal'' the aircraft this way to keep it under control. As it is high off the ground it cannot flip over, even when brakes hard on grass. With crosswinds, in addition to effectuating a classic ''U'' approach, it is advisable to set down the main undercarriage first gently and then let the tail drop to dissipate speed gradually: the brakes and powerful rudder do the rest. Finally, the real difference in landing lies in setting the correct approach speed, thanks to which the Savage almost automatically performs a ''3-point'' touchdown.

4 4 Which is the best engine for the Savage? A good option is the 80 HP Rotax 912 UL, however the most delivered and requested is the Rotax 912 S (100hp). If the aircraft is to be used under certain conditions there are two turbo versions available (Rotax 914 115hp or our own turbo tuning with mechanical air compressor rated 120hp). BMW, LIMBACH and SUBARU engines have also been installed by private customers. Some Jabiru engines were also installed and are flying regularly. Some Smarts diesel engines are operated by few planes too. In addition to the mainstream Rotax range, we are offering the new CUB-S with a choice of Lycoming powerplants particularly suited to the high end LSA market: on one side the beautiful IO233 rated 115hp at 2800rpm, both in carburetor and fuel injected versions, and on the other side a special tuned and reworked lighter version of the IO320, with electronic ignition, and boosting 172hp for the most extreme STOL performance: it actually represents an industry record in power to weight ratio for an LSA, and there will be a lot going around this new aircraft in the next future.

5 5 What experience is needed to put the kit together? We only produce very advanced kits. All welding and covering have already been carried out. No special tools are required, the wings are already complete, ailerons and flaps are fully constructed. The controls are ready to be fitted (already powder-coated). Painting aside, some 450 to 550 working hours will be required for persons of average manual ability. Less if the kit is assembled by experienced professionals.

Painting aside, some 450 to 550 working hours will be required for persons of average manual ability. Less if the kit is assembled by experienced professionals.
6 6 What about cruising speed? And how much space is really required for take-off and landing? With some experience, the 100hp Rotax 912 and a fixed-pitch propeller you can take off in about 75 m (temperature 25°C, no wind, MTOW 472,5 kg). Above all, you can stop in less than 70 m. And thanks to the low-profile cross-section real cruising speed is 160 km/h! (Depends on the engine and prop). A simple Rotax 80 hp, with a good variable propeller (described in our options list) can cruise at 150-155 km/h with about 4.300 rpm. Rotax 100 hp with similar propeller will fly at 170km/h with about 4.350 rpm. Our best performance with VGs installed and standard propeller and atmosphere was (single pilot 85 kg) : take off 38 mt, and landing less than 30 mt. What about cruising speed?

7 7 Can the wings be folded? A special coupling at the wing-fuselage attachment point allows them to be disassembled in about 30 minutes for easy in-hangar storage or trailer transport. Some of our long time customers do it in around 20 minutes. It is not however a one-man operation. Can the wings be folded?

8 8 Being a tandem design, how does it perform when the passenger is on the heavy side? The CG range allows the aircraft to be flown without having to make any significant trim modifications even with passengers as heavy as 125 kg! On the CUB-S, the new “PiperCub” style trim system affecting the angle of the whole stabilizer, is tremendously effective and comfortable to use, and makes it possible to manage effortless greater CG variations, for example when using at full load the extra large baggage compartment.

9 9 Can small damage to the structure be repaired easily? The reticular chromo-molybdenum steel structure is extremely strong, yet there is nothing to stop you cutting, replacing and re-welding a damaged airframe part without having to send it back to the factory, as long as the operation is backed with technical competence. For covering, materials and how-to instructions are easily available. Cheap covering “starter kits” represent a valuable purchase for small fabric repairs. With the previous premise, we can say that repair costs are kept low in comparison to composite structures, and the repair process is normally easier to manage.

10 10 What about the float version? Savage aircrafts are perfect for float operations, and they are being operated this way since years in several countries of the world. All the necessary bushings for a float conversion are already welded into the fuselage, as standard. Some early models might require those fittings to be riveted to the structure. It is possible (only for the Classic and the Cruiser) to order the second door (left). The real non plus ultra as a pure seaplane however, is the Bobber! Can you imagine your flying sensation sitting on its open air tubular structure in full control of your aircraft, jumping around some remote islands or fiords, in full contact with the nature? We are pretty excited to see soon some great pictures of a Bobber used in this environment! What about the float version?

2 1 0 2 2.jpg Hilde's daughter: next generation SAVAGE lady! Alredy 20 hours logged in dual training!
1 1 0 1 1.JPG Hilde: &quot;the SAVAGE is most save bush ULM, nicest also! 150hours of flight
time in verious aeras: Sahara, mountain, riverbed and also just for fun
cruising.&quot;
3 2 0 1 1.jpg Flying from year 2000, ppl, ulm flying instructor and trike pilot, more than 800 hours in aircreation, coyote,  skyranger, ct, a22, cessna ...
I discovered the Savage recently and I fell in love because makes me feel safer even flying much lower, because I know I could land everywhere if I need to.  As I can fly lower, view is much better and nicer, so I really have rediscovered the flight! I also have to say that its easier as most pilots think tail draggers are. Its absolutly amazing how short can take off,  distance landings depends on practice...  in fact  its the perfect plane if you like mountain flying.
From my plane I really like the old classic style, the extra fuel tanks with 90 liters, and the 31&quot; bushweels, I only would rather prefer the 35&quot;....
4 2 0 2 2.jpg Me and my red Cub...:-)
5 3 0 1 1.jpg What I do like best of my Savage is that I feel really comfortable ... Safe ! Probably because its really strong. I always wanted to fly a tail dragger, and I made it!  From my Savage I like everything !!
I decided to get one after flying with Arturo (Spain) and see how short can the take offs and landings be.
I feel that the plane has the perfect size for me and it was equipped for make it the more easy and comfortable as possible. I love the wheel size and the vortex and  that I can fly really slow
She has flown about 400 hours also in Bingo,Eurostar,Mistral,Aeroprat A-22,Coyote,Zenair...
6 4 0 1 1.jpg Flying from 2000, Tecnam, Zenair, CT, A22. About 300 hours flying, 150 in Savage.
Often pilots beginers look for fast planes. This was not my case, as I was looking for a classic plane, a tail dragger in order to land in short mountain runways, any kind of terrain and to make short take offs and landings, to make me feel safe, also strongtness was one the most important facts.. I would say that its the 4x4 of the ulm planes.

3 4 What are the real difficulties with a ''taildragger'' undercarriage? A lot has been said about this: that it is difficult during taxiing because forward visibility is impaired, that propeller torque is difficult to contrast on take-off, that landing requires expert skills, that it is easy to flip over and is unmanageable in crosswinds and so on. These statements are often made by pilots with no direct experience of this type of aircraft who do not distinguish between different versions. Of course, pilots flying ''taildragger'' aircraft must always be fully aware of their particular characteristics because, on the one hand, while they require only short runways to give secure off-field landings, they do, on the other, require greater precision. With the Savage a pilot who is 1.65 m tall can see ahead perfectly without having to zigzag. Special devices which limit the effects of torque mean it is no longer necessary to ''pedal'' the aircraft this way to keep it under control. As it is high off the ground it cannot flip over, even when brakes hard on grass. With crosswinds, in addition to effectuating a classic ''U'' approach, it is advisable to set down the main undercarriage first gently and then let the tail drop to dissipate speed gradually: the brakes and powerful rudder do the rest. Finally, the real difference in landing lies in setting the correct approach speed, thanks to which the Savage almost automatically performs a ''3-point'' touchdown.

6 6 What about cruising speed? And how much space is really required for take-off and landing? With some experience, the 100hp Rotax 912 and a fixed-pitch propeller you can take off in about 75 m (temperature 25<sup style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:-10px">o</sup>C, no wind, MTOW 472,5 kg). Above all, you can stop in less than 70 m. And thanks to the low-profile cross-section real cruising speed is 160 km/h! (Depends on the engine and prop). A simple Rotax 80 hp, with a good variable propeller (described in our options list) can cruise at 150-155 km/h with about 4.300 rpm. Rotax 100 hp with similar propeller will fly at 170km/h with about 4.350 rpm. Our best performance with VGs installed and standard propeller and atmosphere was (single pilot 85 kg) : take off 38 mt, and landing less than 30 mt. What about cruising speed?

10 10 What about the float version? Savage aircrafts are perfect for float operations, and they are being operated this way since years in several countries of the world. All the necessary bushings for a float conversion are already welded into the fuselage, as standard. Some early models might require those fittings to be riveted to the structure. It is possible (only for the Classic and the Cruiser) to order the second door (left). The real non plus ultra as a pure seaplane however, is the Bobber! Can you imagine your flying sensation sitting on its open air tubular structure in full control of your aircraft, jumping around some remote islands or fiords, in full contact with the nature? We are pretty excited to see soon some great pictures of a Bobber used in this environment! What about the float version?

1 1 Why did you decide to call it ''Savage''? Isn't that rather an aggressive name for an aircraft? <p>Because it stems from a ''pure'' passion for a type of flying that is easy-going, calm and goes against the current trend. Today the market is oriented towards low-wing designs, side-by-side seating and front-wheel tricycle undercarriages. The Savage rebels against that approach and challenges it! Don't forget that this plane can really land in wild and remote areas. See our videos or the special accessories list, and you will understand why we consider our product really ''savage''. It is definitely all about the ownership and exciting flying experience that you get with it, which is really Savage! You get really involved and in love with this aircraft&hellip; And it is also about the &ldquo;savage&rdquo; places you can reach with it, which cannot even count as emergency places for landing with other aircrafts.</p>

2 1 How does the Savage handle? <p>Inspired by one of the timeless legends of aviation, the Piper Cub, it consequently features many of its characteristics: excellent STOL performance, superb all-round visibility (even downwards with the optional transparent flooring), comfort, good handling and easy emergency landing thanks to its tough undercarriage and a ''flare'' at around 65 km/h. Much slower if equipped with our Vortex generators Kit, which today comes actually as a standard. Fast-steep climb rate and cruise performance are excellent thanks to contained weight and a low-drag cross-section. It is, then, a reasonably fast cruise machine that is also at home on small airfields with difficult, obstructed approaches.</p>

4 1 Which is the best engine for the Savage? <p>A good option is the 80 HP Rotax 912 UL, however the most delivered and requested is the Rotax 912 S (100hp). If the aircraft is to be used under certain conditions there are two turbo versions available (Rotax 914 115hp or our own turbo tuning with mechanical air compressor rated 120hp). BMW, LIMBACH and SUBARU engines have also been installed by private customers. Some Jabiru engines were also installed and are flying regularly. Some Smarts diesel engines are operated by few planes too. In addition to the mainstream Rotax range, we are offering the new CUB-S with a choice of Lycoming powerplants particularly suited to the high end LSA market: on one side the IO233 rated 115hp at 2800rpm, both in carburetor and fuel injected versions, and on the other side two powerful alternatives. One is a special tuned and reworked lighter version of the IO320, with electronic ignition, and boosting 172hp. The other one is the ECI 340 fuel injected boosting 180hp. Equipped with this last one, the aircraft actually represents an industry record in power to weight ratio for an LSA.</p>

5 1 What experience is needed to put the kit together? <p>We only produce very advanced kits. All welding and covering have already been carried out. No special tools are required, the wings are already complete, ailerons and flaps are fully constructed. The controls are ready to be fitted (already powder-coated). Painting aside, some 450 to 550 working hours will be required for persons of average manual ability. Less if the kit is assembled by experienced professionals.</p>

3 2 <p>The Savage Classic, being the first aircraft that we designed back in 1997, and having been the only model in production for a certain amount of years, it is still today the most popular Savage around. The one that has trained hundreds of pilots, and the one that you can find at airfields around half the globe.</p>
<p><br />
The Savage Classic represents the foundations on top of which we have created our successful range of aircrafts. It embodies the main features that have made our products so popular and appreciated, as the strong 4130 fuselage, robust landing gear, very good visibility and exquisite handling qualities. It is possibly one of the easiest and more docile taildragger airplanes in the market today, being the reason of being so popular and appreciated among flight schools.</p>
<p><br />
Still today, it is very appreciated in certain markets, both because it is our entry level aircraft in the range of the fully enclosed ones, representing a very good value for the money, and also because it still is the lightest aircraft of our range (Bobber and Agilis apart of course).</p>
<p><br />
Build quality of the Savage Classic has no compromise, and performance wise is also very similar to its new successors that we have introduced.</p>
<p><br />
The Savage Classic is a very good and well proven performer, a sound investment, and a very easy to fly aircraft that guarantees many years of satisfaction and a great ownership experience, still keeping a very high resale value after years of service.</p>
<p><br />
In few words, it is a Classic, but still very actual!<br />

<p>The Savage Cruiser has been our first intensive restyling effort carried on in 2005 on the Savage Classic. Restyling is in fact the good word for explaining it, as it all goes around that: new engine cowling and panel housing design, new bottom fuselage and tail shape, and new wing tips and aileron shape. Also the landing gear has been redesigned and got a very streamlined shape, with aerodynamic wheel covers. Side windows also went through the drawing board again. <br />
All those design details have given, together with an array of wonderful paint schemes, a unique look and character to the Savage Cruiser, a very beloved aircraft with a classic, stylish and vintage feel to it. <br />
In fact is not only about style and look, but the streamlined cowling has given that little extra aerodynamic qualities to the aircraft that allow for a better cruise speed over his other brothers, thus making the name &ldquo;Cruiser&rdquo; also very good fit to the aircraft.<br />
Without any doubt, this is the aircraft for cruising with style and get noticed at airfields!</p> 0 1461607184

2 1 0 2 2.jpg Hilde's daughter: next generation SAVAGE lady! Alredy 20 hours logged in dual training!
1 1 0 1 1.JPG Hilde: &quot;the SAVAGE is most save bush ULM, nicest also! 150hours of flight
time in verious aeras: Sahara, mountain, riverbed and also just for fun
cruising.&quot;
3 2 0 1 1.jpg Flying from year 2000, ppl, ulm flying instructor and trike pilot, more than 800 hours in aircreation, coyote,  skyranger, ct, a22, cessna ...
I discovered the Savage recently and I fell in love because makes me feel safer even flying much lower, because I know I could land everywhere if I need to.  As I can fly lower, view is much better and nicer, so I really have rediscovered the flight! I also have to say that its easier as most pilots think tail draggers are. Its absolutly amazing how short can take off,  distance landings depends on practice...  in fact  its the perfect plane if you like mountain flying.
From my plane I really like the old classic style, the extra fuel tanks with 90 liters, and the 31&quot; bushweels, I only would rather prefer the 35&quot;....
4 2 0 2 2.jpg Me and my red Cub...:-)
5 3 0 1 1.jpg What I do like best of my Savage is that I feel really comfortable ... Safe ! Probably because its really strong. I always wanted to fly a tail dragger, and I made it!  From my Savage I like everything !!
I decided to get one after flying with Arturo (Spain) and see how short can the take offs and landings be.
I feel that the plane has the perfect size for me and it was equipped for make it the more easy and comfortable as possible. I love the wheel size and the vortex and  that I can fly really slow
She has flown about 400 hours also in Bingo,Eurostar,Mistral,Aeroprat A-22,Coyote,Zenair...
6 4 0 1 1.jpg Flying from 2000, Tecnam, Zenair, CT, A22. About 300 hours flying, 150 in Savage.
Often pilots beginers look for fast planes. This was not my case, as I was looking for a classic plane, a tail dragger in order to land in short mountain runways, any kind of terrain and to make short take offs and landings, to make me feel safe, also strongtness was one the most important facts.. I would say that its the 4x4 of the ulm planes.

10 5 0 1 2.jpg &quot;Not many things in the real life can let you feel as much satisfied as when you are able to land, in a very soft way, with a Savage plane&quot;..This is a way to feel really connected with the pure sensation of flying, forgetting all the instruments...
