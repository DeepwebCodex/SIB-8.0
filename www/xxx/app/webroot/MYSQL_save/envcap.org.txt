1 AL Solid waste in Alabama is managed according to Division 335-13 of Alabama?s Administrative Code of regulations.  The Alabama regulations do not explicitly address beneficial reuse of solid waste.  However, the regulations specifically allow for the reuse of foundry sand through its ?Requirements for Management and Disposal of Special Waste" in Chapter 335-13-4.26 (3). Alabama Department of Environmental Management's Land Division http://www.adem.state.al.us/programs/land/default.cnt The Land Division administers several of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management's Waste Management and Remediation Programs pursuant to the authorities granted by the provisions of the Alabama Environmental Management Act, Ala. Code ??22-22A-1 to 22-22A-16 and various other Acts. None located. Scrap Tire Program. The Alabama Scrap Tire Environmental Quality Act was passed in 2003 to comprehensively regulate scrap tire accumulations and to provide for cleanup and remediation of illegal scrap tire piles. The Act placed a $1.00 per tire fee on all replacement tires sold to establish a scrap tire fund, and required ADEM to develop a program to regulate the management of scrap tires. http://www.adem.state.al.us/programs/land/scrapTire.cnt 01/01/14
2 AK If a person wants to use a solid waste for beneficial purposes other than the land placement options, that person must submit a proposal explaining the proposed use. The department will review the proposal and exempt the solid waste from some or all of the requirements of this chapter if the department finds that the proposal adequately protects public health, safety, and welfare, and the environment.

5 CA California does not have a formal system in place to address beneficial reuse activities. However, the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB), has established a "Tiered Regulatory Structure" to provide a level of regulatory oversight commensurate with the impacts associated with a solid waste handling or disposal activity. An applicant can petition the CIWMB to reclassify the reuse project as a nonpermit activity requiring less regulatory review. California Natural Resource Agency, California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/ The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) is the California State agency that promotes waste reduction and recycling California regulations address the recycling/reuse of RCRA wastes and additional materials classified by the State as hazardous wastes ("non-RCRA hazardous wastes"), and outline provisions for reusing these wastes as a material in manufacturing.

6 CO Certain beneficial uses of wastes are approved for various materials, such as crumb rubber, tires, and aggregate. If a request is approved, the processor must report of quantity used each calendar year, perform additional analytical testing if source of material changes, register as a recycler for ongoing use, and maintain records of quantities of material used. Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division Solid and Hazardous Waste Program http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/hm/cpgen.htm The Solid and Hazardous Waste Program ensures compliance with State regulations for the proper handling of solid and hazardous wastes. "Commercial use or value" means a material has commercial use or value when (1) it is being beneficially used or reused or legitimately recycled or reclaimed; or (2) it is being accumulated, stored, or physically, chemically, or biologically treated prior to beneficial use or reuse or legitimate recycling or reclamation, and not merely for speculation. ? 260.30 Variances from classification as a solid waste. http://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/GenerateRulePdf.do?ruleVersionId=3161 Biosolids Program The Biosolids Program establishes requirements for the beneficial use of domestic wastewater treatment plant sludge. https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wq-biosolids-permits Beneficial Use and Composting in Colorado Presentation covering beneficial use. https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/recycling 09/15/10
7 CT Section 22a-209f of the General Statutes allows the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to issue general permits for the beneficial use of a solid waste if the proposed use meets certain standards.  If a material meets the standards it may be exempt from further soild waste regulation. Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, Waste Management Bureau, Waste Planning and Standards Division http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?a=2718&q=325332&depNav-GID=1646 Contact the Waste Planning and Standards Division of the DEP Waste Management Bureau to set up a meeting to discuss your proposal.  At the meeting, DEP staff will review preliminary information about your proposal and identify additional information you need to supply so a full evaluation can take place. Beneficial Use means using a solid waste in a manufacturing process to make a product or as an effective substitute for materials used in a commercial product. Section 22a-209f of the General Statutes. http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/lib/sots/regulations/title_22a/209.pdf NEWMOA Beneficial Use Program. With disposal costs on the rise, generators of many wastes are proposing to reuse their waste in new products. Each NEWMOA state has developed a program, called a beneficial use determination (BUD) process, to evaluate these proposals. http://www.newmoa.org/solidwaste/bud.cfm 09/15/10
8 DE In Delaware, the mandate to ?develop a comprehensive statewide system of recycling and resource recovery which maximizes the quantity of solid waste materials which can be recovered, reused or converted to beneficial use" rests with the Delaware Solid Waste Authority under 7 Del. C. Chapter 64. Delaware Solid Waste Authority http://www.dswa.com/ Mission is to optimize the air resources and waste management practices within Delaware by working cooperatively with citizens and businesses to protect public health, welfare and the environment. None located. Scrap tire control and cleanup program Reusing or recycling tires keeps them out of landfills. Old or used tires can be shredded or turned into crumbs to be reused in additives to asphalt for roads and playgrounds.  Pulverized tire chips can become rubber flooring for equestrian and dog training centers. The shredded rubber can also be burned at very high temperatures for energy sources with reduced air pollution. http://www.awm.delaware.gov/Info/Pages/ScrapTire.aspx 09/15/10
9 FL The Department has received numerous requests to use various solid waste materials as products or raw materials in the manufacturing of other products rather than dispose of them in landfills. Examples of some solid wastes that have been proposed for use are: (1) recovered screen material (RSM) from processing construction and demolition debris; (2) Waste-to-Energy (WTE) ash from combusting municipal solid waste (MSW); (3) coal ash from power plants; (4) wood ash; (5) street sweepings; (6) sand blasting media; and (7) metal shredder residue (MSR). These requests are generally handled on a case-by-case basis.  To be successful, the applicant needs to demonstrate that the proposed use of these wastes will not cause ground water or surface water contamination in concentrations above the Department's standards or criteria. Usually the applicant also needs to show that the proposed use will not pose an unacceptable human health risk. Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Waste Management, Solid Waste Section http://www.dep.state.fl.us/waste/categories/solid_waste/default.htm The Division of Waste Management implements state and federal laws relating to recycling, pollution prevention and solid and hazardous waste management. The Solid Waste Section is responsible for implementing the state's solid waste management program. It administers the Financial Assurance Program and Full Cost Accounting for solid waste facilities. Technical assistance is provided to the district offices concerning the permitting, compliance and enforcement activities associated with solid waste facilities. Certain wastes are considered "industrial byproducts" and are not be regulated as solid waste if: 1. A majority of the industrial byproducts are demonstrated to be sold, used, or reused within 1 year. 2. The industrial byproducts are not discharged, deposited, injected, dumped, spilled, leaked, or placed upon any land or water so that such industrial byproducts, or any constituent thereof, may enter other lands or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including groundwaters, or otherwise enter the environment such that a threat of contamination in excess of applicable department standards and criteria is caused. 3. The industrial byproducts are not hazardous wastes as defined under s. 403.703 and rules adopted under this section.  For a full definition, see Florida statute 403.7045.

For additional information, check below under Other Resources. http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2718&q=325406&depNav_GID=1646 What is C&D? This table summarizes the type of waste, legal classification, and examples of C&D wastes. A formal definition for C&D waste does not exist in Connecticut. This results in some confusion because some of what is typically thought to be C&D waste, for instance landclearing debris and demo waste, is really bulky waste according to the legal definition. Furthermore, what is typically thought to be bulky waste, for instance furniture, carpeting, and large appliances, is really oversized municipal solid waste (MSW) according to legal definition. Despite the definitional differences, C&D waste are commonly handled together as bulky waste. http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?a=2718&q=325398&depNav_GID=1645 Green Building:  Management of Residential Construction Waste for The Single Family Home Building Contractor Generalizations, Estimated Percentages, Calculating Amounts of Waste, How to Manage Residential Construction Waste. http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?A=2714&Q=324908

1 1 Asbestos State Resource Locator asbestos-head.jpg Although EPA regulates asbestos (<A HREF=&#34;http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/schools.html#requirements&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;>learn about federal asbestos requirements</A>), states also enforce asbestos regulations, and these are often more stringent and far reaching than the federal rules.  This tool is primarily for asbestos issues relating to demolition/construction. Use our state resource locator to learn about the asbestos regulations in your state or find an OSHA or environmental state agency contact that can assist you.
2 1 Air Pollution State Resource Locator airpollution-head.jpg The Clean Air Act gives EPA the authority to establish regulations, policy, and guidance to protect air quality.  Most federal air pollution regulations are industry-specific (see <A HREF=&#34;http://www.epa.gov/air/oarregul.html&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;>EPA Air Pollution Regulations</A>). States also have laws and regulations protecting air quality, most of which are based on federal rules.  Our air pollution state locator will help you find state and regional regulatory agencies and rules covering topics such as <b>toxic air pollutants, open burning, smoke, dust.</b>
3 1 Beneficial Use State Program Locator beneficial-head.jpg Nearly every industrial process, from manufacturing consumer goods to generating energy, produces different types of usable materials. Beneficial use of these materials avoids the environmental impacts of extracting and processing virgin materials and extends the life of our landfills (for additional information, visit the <A HREF=&#34;http://www.beneficialuseportal.org/&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;>Beneficial Use Portal</A>). Many states have implemented regulations to help ensure that secondary materials are used in a beneficial manner that is protective of human health and the environment.  Our tool identifies individual state rules and programs related to secondary materials use.
4 1 Construction & Demolition Debris State Resource Locator candd-head.jpg Construction and demolition (C&amp;D) debris refers to materials produced during, renovation and/or demolition of structures, where structures include buildings (residential, commercial, institutional), roads, and bridges. Depending on your state&#39;s definition, C&amp;D debris typically include concrete, asphalt, wood, gypsum wallboard, paper, glass, rubble, and roofing materials. C&amp;D wastes are a major source of solid waste. As a result, many state and local governments are seeking ways to divert C&amp;D debris from land disposal, including the promotion of recycling. For more information on C&amp;D waste, see the <A HREF=&#34;http://www.cicacenter.org/solidregs.html&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;>CICA Center</A>. Use our tool to locate regulatory information and other compliance assistance, lists of C&amp;D landfills, and pollution prevention resources for your state.
5 1 Endangered Species State Resource Locator especies-head.jpg Builders and developers may become involved in a project that affects endangered species. Under the authority of the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regulates these impacts. Also, all fifty states have fish and game/wildlife agencies that work in cooperation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service district offices with regard to the &quot;incidental take&quot; permitting process (for more information, see <A HREF=&#34;http://www.cicacenter.org/espermits.html&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;>CICA Center</A>). Many states also have additional laws and regulations that protect endangered species. Use our tool to find out more about the rules in your state and to find points of contact at your U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service district office and state fish and game/wildlife agency.
6 1 Green Building State Resource Locator green-head.jpg &#34;Green building&#34; refers to good design and management practices in all phases of building construction and operation to promote a healthy environment and energy efficiency. EnvCAP.org has developed resources to help you locate green building information, including this state resource locator.  This particular resource identifies state-specific information.  We hope to continually expand this resource with information provided by users, like you.  You can contribute information by completing the form found on your state page.
7 1 RCRA/Hazardous Waste State Resource Locator hazwaste-head.jpg Regulations promulgated pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) establish a &#34;cradle-to-grave&#34; system governing hazardous waste from the point of generation to disposal. Although RCRA is a federal statute (see <A HREF=&#34;http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/inforesources/online/index.htm&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;>RCRA Online</A> for federal information), most states implement the RCRA program and therefore the rules for managing <b>hazardous waste</b> can vary from state to state. Use our tool to find your state&#39;s regulations, along with permit forms, guidance, contact information and other helpful resources.
8 1 Industrial Stormwater State Resource Locator iswrl-head.jpg Businesses in various commercial and industrial sectors must comply with federal and state stormwater regulations. EPA maintains an excellent information resource for federal rules (see <A HREF=&#34;http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/indust.php&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;>EPA&#39;s Industrial Stormwater section</A>). Our resource is designed to help companies know about and comply with state-specific stormwater rules.  The information contained in this tool includes: permitting information, points of contact and useful technical resources.
9 1 Lead Paint Regulations State Resource Locator leadpaint-head.jpg Lead-based paint has been banned since 1978, but many older structures still have this paint on walls, woodwork, siding, windows, and doors. Construction and demolition workers can be exposed to lead contamination by cutting, scraping, sanding, heating, burning, or blasting lead-based paint from building components, metal bridges and metal storage tanks. In most states, C&amp;D debris contaminated with lead-based paint must be managed in different ways depending upon where the debris came from and what it is (for more information, see <A HREF=&#34;http://www.cicacenter.org/leadrrp.php&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;>CICA Center</A>).  The purpose of this on-line tool is to provide quick access to: state rules relating to lead/construction issues, state or federal programs that provide training and certification, and resources that can help achieve compliance. Use our lead paint tool to find your state&#39;s rules covering <b>lead in construction</b> issues, and learn about training and certification programs offered by your state.
10 1 Occupational Safety and Health Resource Locator osha-head.jpg Use the Occupational Safety and Health Tool to locate regulations, points of contact or learn about on-site consultation services in your state.
Occupational safety and health rules in the US are mostly standardized, because:

<ul>
<li>The federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) operate the primary job safety and health program in twenty-nine (29) of the fifty states. This includes conducting inspections and enforcing its standards.</li>
<li>Twenty-one states (21) operate their own job safety and health programs (three additional states cover only state and local government employees). States with approved programs must set job safety and health standards that are &#34;at least as effective as&#34; comparable federal standards. In most cases, states adopt standards identical to federal ones.</li>
</ul>
Consultation services are available in every state. In most cases, these are free and are conducted at your work place or building site. These services help employers identify and correct workplace hazards and can help you avoid violations and penalties.

1 AL Alabama's  regulations specify that in order to quslify for management under these regulations, foundry sands must be shown to be less that 50% of the respective TCLP concentrations for all constituents.  Further, the analysis of the foundry waste must be certified by the generator on at least a quarterly basis. 

<p>

The regulations also specify location restrictions for foundry sand reuse  activities.  Reuse activities are  restricted from floodplains, wetlands, residential zones, and areas less than  five feet above the uppermost aquifer. The beneficial use activities must also meet any applicable NPDES permitting requirements.  

<p>

Alabama's  clear regulatory language assures generators that if reuse activities occur  away from the identified areas, the activities are allowable. The  foundry sand regulation was developed to allow foundries to use their sand as  fill material onsite or offsite.? ADEM  staff stated that they have received inquiries from foundries about other  potential beneficial reuses.? For  example, a foundry recently contacted ADEM to reuse of sands as road base.? The state acknowledged that as long as the  project complies with the existing rule requirements, then the beneficial reuse  is allowable.? Therefore, although the  regulation was originally designed to cover one beneficial reuse activity (fill  material), ADEM applies the regulatory requirements to other proposed  beneficial reuse activities.??

<br><br>

When multiple foundries send sand to a particular reuse  location, these sands may be mixed together and reused as long as each foundry maintains  proper documentation and recordkeeping.? </span></p> Alabama's  regulations specify location restrictions for foundry sand reuse  activities.? Reuse activities are  restricted from floodplains, wetlands, residential zones, and areas less than  five feet above the uppermost aquifer.? 

<br><br>

Alabama's  clear regulatory language assures generators that if reuse activities occur  away from the identified areas, the activities are allowable.? None Identified for solid waste, however the benficial use project must comply with any applicable NPDES permitting requirements. Alabama  has a single-tiered waste classification program structure and, although the  state does not review proposed beneficial reuse activities for foundry sands,  it does require analysis and certification of the foundry sand waste  composition.  To certify the foundry  sands, the generator submits a completed Solid and Hazardous Waste  Determination Form and a TCLP Analysis for metals.  

<br><br>

Once the state receives this information  from the generator, the state reviews the documentation.  The Alabama program is distinct in that ADEM  reviews the constituent concentration levels rather than the generator's  proposed beneficial reuse activity.   Generators may consider this process to be less burdensome because the  generator only needs to provide to the ADEM basic initial sampling and testing  information on the foundry sand.  This  initial review may also streamline the state's approval process, and allow  generators to proceed with reuse activities sooner than would be possible if  the state conducted a more detailed review.     

<br><br>

The  agency sends a certification letter to the applicant, approving of the  generator's Solid and Hazardous Waste Determination Form and TCLP  Analysis.  This is not in the  regulations, but ADEM staff indicated this action is performed. Alabama's Administrative Code of regulations  specifies maximum allowable constituent thresholds, based on Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) TC levels, to determine if a waste is beneficially  reusable.  To be determined reusable,  foundry sands must demonstrate constituent levels less than 50 percent of the  TC levels for metals.  The TCLP Analysis  must be submitted to ADEM along with a Solid and Hazardous Waste Determination  Form.  The form must provide the name of  the generator and describe the waste generating process, the physical state, and  whether the sand will be used as a fill material. Once initially approved by ADEM, follow-up certifications must be performed by the generator on a quarterly basis. 

<br><br>

Additionally,  the generator must contact the Water Division of ADEM to obtain any necessary  General Stormwater and/or National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  (NPDES) permits for the reuse sites. ADEM does not conduct testing and analyses for generators. Alabama requires quarterly testing and reporting of  foundry sands to ensure that the waste continues to meet the constituent  concentration levels.? In Chapter  335-13-4-.26(3)(c), the regulations state that a Solid and Hazardous Waste  Determination Form and a TCLP Analysis be submitted to ADEM quarterly or  whenever the production process changes in such a manner that would  significantly alter the test results.?

<br><br>

The regulations also require that each foundry maintain  records at the manufacturing facility.?  These records include a description of the site where beneficial reuse  occurs, the site's location within a specific township and range, and the  volume of sand at the location.?? </span></p> None identified.

        commensurate with the impacts associated with a solid waste handling

        or disposal activity.  An applicant can petition the CIWMB to reclassify

        the reuse project as a nonpermit activity requiring less regulatory review. California regulations address the recycling/reuse

        of RCRA wastes and additional materials classified by the State as hazardous

        wastes (&quot;non-RCRA hazardous wastes&quot;), and outline provisions

        for reusing these wastes as a material in manufacturing.  These provisions

        focus on testing to confirm the waste's composition and establishing

        that recycling/reuse is viable (e.g., the market for the material exists,

        the reuse does not constitute disposal, the material will not require

        processing or significant storage prior to reuse, see <a

        for composting facilities using organic wastes, but there are no regulations

        for composting or land application of materials containing other solid

        wastes. The only thresholds explicitly referred

        to by California environmental agencies are the RCRA toxicity characteristic

      </table> California does not have a specific permit

        for sand reuse.  However, you must get approval from various agencies

        before initiating a reuse project. Leachate testing is required to evaluate

        all industrial wastes. Depending on the waste classification sought by

        the applicant, additional testing is also required, including, at a minimum,

        whole effluent toxicity.

<br><br>



DTSC, which generally regulates hazardous

        and potentially hazardous wastes, may first need to review leachate testing

        and waste composition data to grant a waiver from hazardous waste regulations

        or reclassify the waste as non-hazardous &quot;designated industrial

        waste.&quot;  Similarly, the water boards and CIWMB may review leachate

        data and whole effluent toxicity data to determine if the waste is an &quot;inert

        waste,&quot; which is subject to fewer regulatory requirements than other

        waste categories.

<br><br>

Additional requirements depend on the proposed

        type of reuse:<br><br>

     If the reuse will include soil operations or composting,

          then the State and Regional Water Boards must review the project in

          addition to the CIWMB, and each of these agencies can establish other

          requirements including public notification, siting limitations, additional

          testing, volume restrictions, special handling and storage requirements,

          etc.

        <br><br>If the waste will be reused as a raw material in manufacturing,

          no Water Board review is required and the CIWMB is likely to establish

          less stringent requirements. In fact, the CIWMB has established a &quot;Tiered

          Regulatory Structure&quot; to provide a level of regulatory oversight

          commensurate with the impacts associated with a solid waste handling

          or disposal activity.  An applicant can petition the CIWMB to reclassify

          the reuse project as a nonpermit activity requiring less regulatory

          review (see <a

<br>

<b>Federal Regulations</b>

<br>

<ul>

<li><b>U.S. EPA.</b> Asbestos was widely used in buildings for fireproofing, thermal and acoustical insulation, condensation control, and decoration. It was sprayed on beams and ceilings, used to cover piping and boilers, and sprayed into ducts. Asbestos was used extensively until the 1970s when the U.S. EPA banned certain applications. 

<br>

<br>

When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disturbed by repair, remodeling or demolition activities, microscopic fibers become airborne and can be inhaled into the lungs, where they can cause significant health problems.

<br>

<br>

The <a href=&#34;http://www.epa.gov/resources-small-businesses/asbestos-small-business-ombudsman&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Asbestos and Small Business Ombudsman</a> (ASBO), Office of Small Business Programs, under the Office of the Administrator, serves as a conduit for small businesses to access EPA and facilitates communications between the small business community and the Agency.

<br>

<br>

<li><b>Asbestos NESHAP.</b> The Asbestos National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) (<a href=&#34;/pdf/40cfr61m.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;>40 CFR 61, subpart M</a>) protects the public by minimizing the release of asbestos fibers during renovation and demolition activities. Accordingly, this regulation specifies work practices to be followed for demolitions and renovations of all structures, installations, and buildings.



<li><b>OSHA.</b> The OSHA asbestos standard (<a href=&#34;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2009-title29-vol8/pdf/CFR-2009-title29-vol8-sec1926-1101.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;>29 CFR 1926.1101</a>) applies to employees exposed during the removal of asbestos and includes requirements for engineering controls, work practices, personal protective equipment, exposure assessment, medical surveillance, and training.

<b>Endangered Species Incidental Take Permits</b><br>
Private landowners, corporations, state or local governments, or other non-federal landowners who wish to conduct activities on their land that might incidentally harm (or &#34;take&#34;) a species listed as endangered or threatened must first obtain an incidental take permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  
<p>
To obtain a permit, the applicant must develop a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), designed to offset any harmful effects the proposed activity might have on the species. The HCP process allows development to proceed while promoting listed species conservation. The &#34;<a href=&#34;https://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/f980223.pdf&#34;>No Surprises Policy</a>&#34; provides assurances to landowners participating in HCP efforts.

<p>
Activities that take place at industrial facilities, such as material handling and storage, are often exposed to the weather. As runoff from rain or snowmelt comes into contact with these activities, it can pick up pollutants and transport them to a nearby storm sewer or directly to a river, lake, or coastal water. To minimize the impact of stormwater discharges from industrial facilities, the  <a href=&#34;{srt.primaryagencyurl}&#34;>{srt.primaryagencyname}</a> regulates industrial stormwater for <a href=&#34;https://www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater-discharges-industrial-activities%23overview&#34;>10 categories of industrial activity</a>.  Those regulations require authorization under an industrial stormwater permit or certification that industrial activities are not exposed to stormwater runoff.
<p>
To apply for an individual permit or for coverage under a statewide general permit you must file an application with the <a href=&#34;{srt.primaryagencyurl}&#34;>{srt.primaryagencyname}</a> prior to commencement of your industrial activities. These permits must be renewed every five years. All industrial stormwater permits include the requirement that a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) be developed and implemented.
<p>
Alternatively, you may certify that your industrial activities are not exposed to stormwater runoff by submitting a &#34;no exposure certification.&#34; As long as the condition of &#34;no exposure&#34; exists at a certified facility, the operator is excluded from industrial stormwater permit requirements.  The no-exposure certification must be re-submitted every five years. If conditions change at the facility and materials or activities become exposed, the facility must immediately file for a stormwater permit.
<p>
In addition to these statewide rules, you may be required to meet additional local stormwater regulations. Check with your city or county government to determine if additional local rules apply to your industrial facility.
<p>
For Indian Country lands in {statefullname}, U.S. EPA is the permitting authority for construction stormwater discharges. For more information, see <a href=&#34;https://www.epa.gov/npdes/final-2015-msgp-documents&#34;>EPA Multi-Sector General Permit (MSGP)</a>.

<b>Introduction</b><br>
The construction industry is affected by two separate regulations that impact activities associated with lead paint. These regulations include:
<ul>
<li><b>Lead-Based Paint Abatement.</b> These regulations apply to lead abatement projects that are designed to permanently eliminate existing lead-based paint hazards from housing and child-occupied facilities. They may be ordered by state or local government in response to a lead-poisoned child or other reasons, or may be undertaken voluntarily at any time. To conduct this work, individuals and firms must be trained and certified. In {statefullname}, the state administers the lead-based abatement program. <a href=&#34;http://www.cicacenter.org/lead_abatement_regulation.html&#34;>More information on Lead-Based Paint Abatement Rule</a>.
<li><b>Renovation, Repair and Painting.</b> These rules affect projects at residential buildings (owner-occupied and rental), and child-occupied facilities such as day care centers. The projects are typically performed at the option of the property owner for aesthetic or other reasons or as an interim control to minimize lead hazards. It is not designed to permanently eliminate lead-based hazards. Firms and individual renovators performing the work must be trained and certified in lead-safe RRP practices. In {statefullname}, the US EPA administers the RRP certification program. <a href=&#34;http://www.cicacenter.org/leadrrp.php&#34;>More information on RRP rule</a>.

The Management of Spent Mercury-Containng Lamps and Devices Destined For Recycling. Florida has adopted by reference the federal regulations pertaining to the management of universal wastes found at 40 CFR 273 "revised as of July 1, 2003." Therefore, although the 1999 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations for fluorescent lamps are in effect in Florida, the EPA regulations for mercury-containing equipment that were added in August 2005 are not, as they did not exist at the time of the July 1, 2003, CFR edition. However, the state has added its own provisions for the regulation of mercury-containing lamps and mercury-containing devices destined for recycling, and therefore, the Florida rules for lamps and mercury-containing devices differ from the federal rules for lamps and mercury-containing equipment. http://www.dep.state.fl.us/waste/quick_topics/rules/documents/62-737.pdf Environmental Issues with Mercurry An explanation of rules relating to spent mercury-containing lamps and devices. http://www.dep.state.fl.us/waste/categories/mercury/pages/environmental_issues.htm

1 AL http://adem.alabama.gov/programs/coastal/default.cnt Projects which include potential impacts to waterbottoms or the dredging and/or filling of wetlands will require permits and/or certifications from ADEM, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers(USACE), and, in some instances, the State Oil and Gas Board, and/or the ALDCNR-State Lands Division.  The ADEM review of these types of projects is normally initiated when the property owner makes application to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Some of these projects, such as the construction of residential piers and projects involving minimal wetlands impacts, may be permitted under a pre-certified USACE General or Nationwide Permit and will not require further review by the Department. Many projects will require an Individual Permit from the USACE, which will be jointly reviewed by the USACE and ADEM concurrently. This includes: Marinas, including the expansion of existing marinas; Shoreline stabilization such as seawalls, bulkheads, jetties, groins and similar structures; Beach nourishment projects; Major dredging projects; Projects involving more than minimal impacts to wetlands; and Placement of oil and gas platforms. Dredge and fill activities that are not regulated under the state's Coastal Area Management Program are only reviewed through the DEM's ? 401 Water Quality Certification program. Applicants must replace wetlands or enhance or restore existing degraded wetlands. http://adem.alabama.gov/inside/contact.cnt Wetlands are areas "delineated pursuant to the technical criteria described in the Federal Wetlands Delineation Manual that is currently being used in the Federal Corps of Engineers and/or any other updated manual that may be used in the future." Wetlands do not include areas that result from man-made conditions, except for mitigation sites. The DEM defines regulated activities as any activity which is subject to the management program and which requires a state permit or which is required by federal law to be consistent with the management program. A permit or certification is needed to dredge or fill state waterbottoms or adjacent wetlands. Certain uses of wetlands are acceptable when they are conducted according to DEM regulations. These are the fulfillment of an emergency decree or pronouncement to protect the public health and safety; the conservation, repletion, and research activities of the Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium, the Marine Resources Division of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortium; the exercise of riparian rights; normal maintenance and repair of bulkheads, piers, roads, and highways; the use of structures or lands for dwelling purposes, including activities normally associated with and incidental to a dwelling; activities normal and associated with the maintenance and repair of railroads, utilities, transportation, telephone communication, or distribution or gas, electricity or water; mosquito control efforts; the planting, growing, or harvesting of plants, crops, trees, or agricultural/forestry products; completion of legally valid housing developments; construction of minor structures; conservation, repletion, research and management associated with a Estuarine Research Reserve, state/federal park or wildlife reserve, the marine mammal stranding network, the US Fish and Wildlife Service or the DEM; aquatic weed control programs. Persons must first contact the DEM before beginning a permissible use. http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/lawsguidance/cwa/wetlands/laws_index.cfm http://adem.alabama.gov/programs/coastal/coastalPermitting.cnt Permitting Information Information relative to projects having the potential to impact Alabama's wetlands and coastal resources. 83115
2 AK http://dec.alaska.gov/water/wwdp/wetlands/index.htm The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, (COE) Alaska District, and EPA administers the Clean Water Act Section 404 Permitting Program. Over 80% of all actions subject to Section 404 are authorized by the COE via general permits. which authorize categories of activities to proceed without an individual permit application. General permits allow actions with minimal impacts to proceed with little if any administrative burden. This allows regulators and others to concentrate attention on activities with potential for significant impacts. At present, there are 36 nationwide general permits that authorize such activities as placement of out fall structures, road crossings, utility line backfill, boat ramps, farm buildings, and minor discharges. If an activity does have significant impacts it must undergo a more extensive regulatory review. At this point wetlands are regulated mainly through the 404 process. ADEC's goal is to provide a more scientific and regionally based, rapid assessment tool, through the HGM methodology.  Wetlands found in coastal areas are protected under the Alaska Coastal Management Program. The Division of Governmental Coordination ensures that all state resource agencies that could be impacted by the proposed use of a coastal area find the applicant's proposal consistent with the Coastal Management Program. Wetlands are managed to assure adequate water flow, nutrients, and oxygen levels and avoid adverse effects on natural drainage patterns, the destruction of important habitat, and the discharge of toxic substances. Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) statutes and regulations regarding water quality are incorporated into the Alaska Coastal Management Program. he Corps mitigates wetland impacts whenever possible. Most mitigation in Alaska is achieved by avoiding or minimizing impacts, but on occasion compensatory mitigation is required. Compensatory mitigation, or requiring an applicant to replace affected wetlands as a condition of a permit, usually occurs only when the most fragile wetland acres are disturbed. In 1999, the Corps received requests for using 2,212 acres of wetlands and granted permits for 2,059, of which 638 acres required wetland mitigation. See: <a href=http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/releases/Alaska.htm>http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/releases/Alaska.htm</a>. http://dec.alaska.gov/water/wwdp/wetlands/index.htm State wetlands covers both freshwater and saltwater wetlands. Freshwater wetlands are "environments characterized by rooted vegetation which is partially submerged either continuously or periodically by surface freshwater with less than .5 parts per thousand salt content and not exceeding three meters in depth." Saltwater wetlands are coastal areas along sheltered shorelines characterized by halophilic hydrophytes and macroalgae extending from extreme low tide to an area above extreme high tide which is influenced by sea spray or tidally induced water table exchanges. The placement of structures and the discharge of dredged and fill material into coastal waters must, at a minimum, meet the standards set in 33 C.F.R. 320-323. http://dec.alaska.gov/commish/regulations.aspx http://dec.alaska.gov/water/wwdp/wetlands/index.htm Permit Information 83115
3 AZ http://www.azdeq.gov/programs/water-quality-programs/watershed-protection The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) administers regulations for wetlands in Arizona through its ?401 water quality program.  The basic premise of the program is that no discharge of dredged or fill material can be permitted if a practicable alternative exists that is less damaging to the aquatic environment or if the nation's waters would be significantly degraded. In applying for a permit, the applicant must show that they have: taken steps to avoid wetland impacts where practicable; minimize potential impacts to wetlands; provided compensation for any remaining, unavoidable impacts through activities to restore or create wetlands. The program is jointly administered between the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA. The Corps duties include: administering the day-to-day program, including individual permit decisions and jurisdictional determinations; developing policy and guidance; enforcing Section 404 provisions.  The EPA is responsible for: developing and interpreting environmental criteria used in evaluating permit applications; determining the scope of geographic jurisdiction; identifying activities that are exempt; review/comments on individual permit applications; has the authority to veto the Corps' permit decision; elevating specific cases; enforcing Section 404 provisions.  The Corps has a number of authorization mechanisms including permits, letters of permission, and regional or state specific permissions.  An individual permit is required for projects that have potentially significant impacts. Individual permits require an  application form describing the proposed activity be submitted to the Corps. Once the application is complete, the Corps issues a public notice containing the information needed to evaluate the likely impact of the activity. Notice is sent to all interested parties including adjacent property owners, government agencies and others who have requested notice. A hearing may be requested for cause.  However, for discharges that have only minimal adverse effects, the Corps have developed general permits that can be issued on a nationwide, regional or state basis for particular types of activities (e.g., minor road crossings, utility line backfill, flood control projects). General permits are developed and require the same public notice requirements and opportunity for public hearing. Once issued, the general permit may be modified or revoked if the activities are found to have adverse impacts. General permits are issued for a specified time period, usually five years. Currently there are 40 nationwide general permits (NWP). These NWPs have been CWA 401 certified by ADEQ and many contain State specific conditions in addition to the Corps requirements. ADEQ has authority under Section 401 of the CWA to grant, deny or waive water quality certification for both individual and nationwide permits. The Corps cannot issue a permit, individual or general, where ADEQ hasn't approved or waived certification or where ADEQ has denied certification. http://www.azdeq.gov/ContactUs Wetlands are areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency or duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. The Department reviews all individual and some nationwide ?404 permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material. Projects on Native American Reservations are not reviewed by the DEQ. https://www.azleg.gov/arstitle/ http://www.azdeq.gov/environ/water/permits/app.html Permit Information 83115
4 AR https://www.adeq.state.ar.us/water/planning/ Section 401 Water Quality Certifications are required prior to the issuance of federal permits and licenses to ensure that proposed projects will not violate the State's water quality standards. The decision to issue the Section 401 water quality certification rests with the Director of ADEQ and is based on compliance with Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission Regulation 2 (PDF File 4.8mb), Regulation Establishing Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of the State of Arkansas. The majority of the Section 401 water quality certification requests are for Section 404 permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In Arkansas there are 3 Corps Districts that share jurisdiction in the State: the Little Rock District, the Memphis District and the Vicksburg District. CT 562- Arkansas Wetlands Mitigation Bank Act. An Act to create an Arkansas Wetlands Mitigation Bank; allow for purchase, creation, restoration, or enhancement of wetlands by the state of Arkansas; allow for sale of credits on wetlands for meeting federal permit requirements; use the Arkansas Water Development Fund for financial aspects of the mitigation bank; and other purposes. https://www.adeq.state.ar.us/home/contactus.aspx Wetlands are regulated as surface waters or water contained on the exterior or upper portion of the earth's surface as opposed to groundwater. Permits are issued to regulate pollution, the discharge of sewage, industrial waste, or other waste into state waters; and the installation, modification, or operation of disposal systems.18 The state also identifies permit actions as any activity under a specific dredge or fill permit requested or issued under ?404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act or any other action requiring mitigation. https://www.adeq.state.ar.us/regs/ https://www.adeq.state.ar.us/water/permits/ Permit Information 83115
5 CA http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/cwa401/index.shtml The California Environmental Protection Agency and its State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) monitor wetlands in the state. The SWRCB, in particular, is responsible for updating the state's wetland inventory resources. The Board also has authority under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act to regulate the placement of clean fill dirt into state waters. The Department of Parks and Recreation, Department of Fish and Game, and the California Coastal Conservancy preserve wetlands according to provisions in the California Public Resources Code. Wetlands are regulated through a ?401 water quality certification process, although The California Coastal Act is the primary statutory scheme regulating activities in coastal wetlands. Permits are not granted unless applicants provide feasible mitigation measures for the proposed project. Mitigation for dredge or fill activities must include either the acquisition of equivalent areas of equal or greater biological productivity or opening up equivalent areas to tidal action.30 A fee suitable to provide an area of similar value can be dedicated to a state agency when no restoration site is available.  See: <a href=http://ceres.ca.gov/wetlands/projects2.html>http://ceres.ca.gov/wetlands/projects2.html</a>. https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/cwa401/docs/staffdirectory.pdf Wetlands occur where the water table is at, near, or above the land surface long enough to promote the formation of hydric soils or to support the growth of hydrophytes, and includes those areas where vegetation is lacking and soil is poorly developed or absent as a result of frequent or drastic fluctuations of surface water levels, wave action, water flow, turbidity, or high concentrations of salt or other substances in the substrate. The statutes give priority to protecting wetlands lying within, or adjacent to, existing state parks or other state owned lands protected and managed as a wildlife habitat. Discharges into waters that require a federal permit or license also need a ?401certification that the discharge complies with state water quality standards. Persons may also need to obtain a coastal development permit for any development in a coastal zone. In the coastal zone the diking, filling, or dredging of wetlands must occur according to the state's coastal resources planning and management policies. This stipulation is limited to the following activities: new or expanded port, energy, and coastal-dependent industrial facilities, including commercial fishing facilities; maintaining existing, or restoring previously dredged, depths in navigational channels, turning basins, vessels berthing and mooring areas, and boat launching ramps; entrance channels for new and expanded boating facilities; incidental public service activities such as burying cable and pipes; mineral extraction; restoration purposes; and nature study, aquaculture, or similar resource-dependent activities. https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/cwa401/docs/401regs.pdf https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/cwa401/index.html#resources Permit Information 102615
6 CO https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wq-401-water-quality-certification The Colorado Water Quality Control Division (WQCD) reviews and issues Water Quality Certifications under Section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) for projects or actions that are applicable to the provisions of the Colorado 401 Certification Regulation (WQCC Regulation #82: 5 CCR 1002-82). A CWA ?401 Water Quality Certification is required for any federal license or permit that is issued to construct or operate a facility, which may result in any fill or discharge into the navigable waters of the United States. Required Submittals: Revisions to Section 82.4 of the Regulation require the applicant to submit to the WQCD: (1) Copy of the CWA Section 404 Permit Application, (2) Project site plan, (3)List or description of the Best Management Practices (BMPs) associated with the project. Certification Process: The WQCD certification process involves the following steps: 1 Preliminary review of proposed project. 2. Public notice (30 days) of preliminary review.  3. Review of public comments.  4. Final water quality certification decision for proposed project. Nationwide CWA ?404 Permits: Under the Colorado 401 Certification Regulation, all nationwide permits are certified by statute and do not require a certification by the WQCD. Applicants for Nationwide Permits do not need to submit any information or documents to the WQCD. Individual CWA ?404 Permits: The following is a summary of the major requirements that shall apply to all water quality certifications for individual permits or licenses. For a complete list of requirements, please refer to the regulation (WQCC Regulation #82: 5 CCR 1002-82). ? Discharges of dredged or fill material in excess of that which is necessary to complete the project are not permitted. ? Discharges to state waters not identified in the license or permit and not certified in accordance therewith are not allowed, subject to the terms of any 401 certification. ? The project shall incorporate BMPs into the project to assure compliance with the Clean Water Act. https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/water-quality-control-division-contacts Wetlands are "areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions." Wetlands can be classified under CDPHE's standards and methodologies for surface water. Surface water in the state is subject to numeric or narrative standards set by the CDPHE's regulations. Different standards apply to surface water in tributary wetlands, created wetlands, compensatory wetlands, and other wetlands not falling within these three categories. Tributary wetlands are head waters of surface waters of wetlands within the floodplain that are hyrdologically connected to surface waters via either surface or ground water flows. A tributary wetland is initially subject to interim classifications and numeric standards. Created wetlands are in areas that would not be wetlands in the absence of human modifications to the environment. Created wetlands are only subject to narrative standards, unless the Commission had adopted wetlands classification and appropriate numeric standards. Compensatory wetlands are developed for mitigation of adverse impacts to other wetlands. Compensatory wetlands are subject to the standards of the segment where they are located, if the Commission has not adopted a wetland classification and appropriate numeric standards. All other wetlands that are state waters are governed by narrative standards, unless the Commission adopts wetlands classification and appropriate numeric standards. Discharges of dredged or fill material are regulated. In addition, water management or hydroelectric facilities, including all buildings and facilities necessary for the project's operation, are regulated. https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/82_2003%2803%29hdr.pdf https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/WQ_General-Requirements-for-all-401-Certifications.pdf Permit Information 101315
7 CT http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2720&Q=325684&depNav_GID=.. In 1972, the Connecticut Legislature enacted the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act (Act). This law is found in section 22a-36 through 22a-45 of the Connecticut General Statutes. The Act created a regulatory process to consider the impacts of proposed activities on inland wetlands and watercourses; and in keeping with the home rule political culture of our state, the Act provided for municipalities to implement this regulatory process. By the mid-1980s the majority of municipalities were administering the Act with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) regulating activities within approximately 25 towns or cities.

<p>

In 1987, the Connecticut Legislature amended the Act and provided language that clearly signaled its desire to have <u>all municipalities administering this law.</u> Section 22a-42 of the Act was amended to read, "To carry out and effectuate the purposes and policies of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, it is hereby declared to be the public policy of the state to require municipal regulation of activities affecting the wetlands and watercourses within the territorial limits of the various municipalities or districts". In addition, the amendment required that all municipalities establish an inland wetlands agency by July 1, 1988. <u>As a result, all of Connecticut's 169 communities now have municipal inland wetlands agencies</u>. In fact, there are 170 municipal inland wetlands agencies as the City of Groton and the Town of Groton are separate.

<p>

Today's municipal inland wetlands agency regulates activities that affect inland wetlands and watercourses within their municipal boundaries. These activities, often referred to as "regulated activities", are those proposed or conducted by all persons other than state agencies. State agency actions are solely regulated by the DEP. The volume of business conducted by municipal inland wetlands agencies is substantial on a statewide basis. Over 4,000 actions (such as permit approvals or denials, enforcement proceedings, etc.) are taken by Connecticut's municipal inland wetlands agencies annually, and this number is increasing by approximately 12 percent per year. Persons that wish to conduct a regulated activity in a wetland in a coastal area must demonstrate the activity is consistent with state policy and that it incorporates all reasonable measures that would mitigate its adverse environmental impact. http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?a=2720&Q=325680&depNav_GID=1907 Wetlands are land, including submerged land, not regulated under the Tidal Wetlands Act which are comprised of soil types designated as poorly drained, very poorly drained, alluvial, and flood plain under the National Cooperative Soils Survey of the Soil Conservation Service of the US Department of Agriculture. Any operation within or use of a wetland or watercourse involving the removal or deposition of material, or any obstruction, construction, alteration, or pollution in such wetlands or watercourses. The following activities are not regulated under the act: 1. The grazing, farming, nursing, gardening, and harvesting of crops and farm ponds of three acres or less that are essential to the farm's operation, and activities conducted by or under the authority of the DEP for wetland and watercourse restoration; 2. A residential home for which a building permit has been issued; 3. Boat anchorage or mooring; 4. Uses incidental to the enjoyment and maintenance of residential property; 5. Construction and operation of municipal dams or reservoirs by water companies; 6. Maintenance relating to certain drainage pipes. Other activities, such as the conservation of natural resources, outdoor recreation, or construction by state agencies, do not require a permit. http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2704&q=323512&deepNav_GID=1511 http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2709&q=324222&deepNav_GID=1643 Permit Information http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?a=2720&q=325684&depNav_GID=1654 Inland Wetlands Management http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?a=2720&q=325680&depNav_GID=1654 A Citizen's Guide To Participating in the Municipal Regulation Of Inland Wetlands and Watercourses 83115
8 DE http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/Admin/DelawareWetlands/Pages/default.aspx The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) regulates activities under the Wetlands Act. The Secretary of the DNREC decides whether or not a permit for the proposed activity should be issued. The Secretary also prepares wetland inventory maps that are available to the public. http://www.wr.dnrec.delaware.gov/Services/Pages/WetlandsAndSubaqueousLands.aspx Wetlands are "lands above the mean low water elevation including any bank, marsh, swamp, meadow, flat or other low land subject to tidal action in the state along the Delaware Bay and Delaware River, Indian River Bay, Rehoboth Bay, Little and Big Assawoman Bays, the coastal inland waterways, or along any inlet, estuary, or tributary waterway or portion thereof, including those areas which are now or in this century have been connected to tidal waters, whose surface is at or below an elevation of 2 feet above local mean high water, and upon which may grow or is capable of growing any but not necessarily all of the plants" listed in the statute. The state's conservation laws suggest that wetlands can also be separated according to their ecological value, but specific categories are not mentioned. Dredging, draining, filling, bulkheading, construction of any kind, including the construction of a pier, jetty, breakwater, boat ramp; or the mining, drilling or excavation of a wetland. Exemptions are available for: mosquito control activities authorized by the DNREC; construction of directional aids to navigation; duck blinds; foot bridges; the placing of boundary stakes; wildlife nesting structures; grazing of domestic animals; haying; hunting; and fishing and trapping. http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/swc/info/Pages/RegsLaws.aspx http://www.wr.dnrec.delaware.gov/Information/Permits/Pages/WetlandsandSubaqueousLandsPermittingInfo.aspx Permit application forms for wetlands activities, including construction. 83115
9 FL http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/wetlands/ The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) regulates wetlands under its Environmental Resource Permit (ERP) Program.  Part IV of Chapter 373 of the applicable state statute covers the State's surface water regulatory program, which is jointly implemented by DEP and the five Water Management Districts (Northwest Florida, Suwannee River, St. Johns River, Southwest Florida, and South Florida Water Management Districts) using a mixture of rules adopted by DEP and/or each specific WMD. To further streamline the above programs, the Department and the WMDs are pursuing delegations of the ERP program to local governments. For those local governments that qualify and are granted delegation, all necessary authorizations under the ERP program, as well as any needed additional local permits, will be granted or denied at the same time by the local government. This is a regulatory program that covers virtually any movement of soil surface or construction of structures anywhere in the peninsula of Florida, from coast to coast, including uplands and wetlands. The exception is that, within the panhandle (roughly from Escambia County eastward to Jefferson County) the program is implemented using a dredge and fill permit program (under ch. 62-312, F.A.C.) that is limited to surface waters and "contiguous" (not isolated) wetlands, and a stormwater program (under ch. 62-25) that regulates most construction of impervious surfaces (in uplands and wetlands). Florida implements ? 401 by granting or denying state water quality certification as part of the regulatory decision to issue or deny a state permit application; the water quality certification decision is then immediately forwarded to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Mitigation banking permits allow recipients to construct, alter, operate, maintain, abandon, or remove any surface water necessary to establish and operate a mitigation bank. The applicant must demonstrate several factors to qualify for a mitigation bank permit including sufficient legal or equitable interest in the land to ensure perpetual protection and the ability to meet the financial responsibility assigned to mitigation banks. The DEP also awards credits based on the degree of improvement in ecological value expected to result from the establishment and operation of the bank. See <a href=http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/wetlands/mitigation/index.htm>http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/wetlands/mitigation/index.htm</a>. https://floridadep.gov/water/submerged-lands-environmental-resources-coordination/content/contacts-submerged-lands-and Wetlands are areas "inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and a duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soils." The ERP program regulates the construction, alteration, maintenance, removal, modification, and operation of all activities in uplands, wetlands and other surface waters (whether publicly or privately-owned) that will alter, divert, impede, or otherwise change the flow of surface waters. That includes dredging and filling in most surface waters and wetlands (whether isolated or connected to other waters). For example, this program covers the construction of new buildings, roadways, and parking areas that increase impervious surfaces and stormwater runoff. Activities determined to have only a minimal, or insignificant impact on the water resources in a district are exempt. A request to qualify for this exemption must be submitted in writing to the district where the wetland is located or the DEP. Activities with the primary purpose of environmental restoration or water quality improvement on agricultural lands are exempt when a district or DEP has determined the activity poses a minimal individual and cumulative adverse impact on the state's water resources. Altering a tract of land for agriculture, silviculture, floriculture, or horticulture is exempt unless the alteration's main purpose is to impound or obstruct surface water. The maintenance, construction, or operation of an agricultural closed system is also not regulated under the program. Furthermore, mining activities conducted under a mine permit are exempt. http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/wetlands/erp/rules/index.htm http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/wetlands/erp/index.htm This web page contains links to permit information and forms. 111615
10 GA http://epd.georgia.gov/watershed-protection-branch Georgia uses ?401 as part of its statutory scheme to protect wetlands. Section 401 operates in conjunction with other laws such as the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act and the Water Quality Control Act to guard natural resources.  The Marshlands Protection Committee oversees the state's Coastal Marshland Protection Program. The program covers marshlands or salt marsh within state estuarine areas. The Corps will continue to refer applicants to available wetland commercial mitigation banks when they are available in a service area. The mitigation banks allow applicants to make payment to owners of wetlands banks for purchase of wetlands set aside in a banking arrangement. This option has been offered to applicants for several years and will continue providing the service.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District and the Georgia Land Trust Service Center entered into a partnership agreement recently on wetlands impacts. The Land Trust Service Center, headed by Hans Neuhauser, will work with the Corps in facilitating a new mitigation option for applicants of the Clean Water Act Section 404 permitting process by assisting them with mitigation of wetlands impacts. Both mitigation banking, a present option, and the Georgia Land Trust Service Center will permanently preserve wetlands to compensate for the loss of wetlands authorized through the Clean Water Act Section 404 permitting process. https://epd.georgia.gov/sites/epd.georgia.gov/files/wpb_phonelist.pdf Wetlands are defined as marshlands or coastal marshlands under the state's conservation and natural resources laws. Marshlands means any "marshland intertidal area, mud flat, tidal water bottom, or salt marsh in the state of Georgia within the estuarine area of the state, whether or not the tidewaters reach the littoral areas through natural or artificial watercourses."  Wetlands are further identified as waters or waters of the state for the purposes of water quality monitoring. Waters of the state are "any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells, wetlands, and all other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the state which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation." All dredge and fill activities in state freshwater wetlands are regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Persons, however, cannot remove, drain, fill, dredge or otherwise alter any marshland without first obtaining a permit from the Committee or, in the case of minor alterations, from the Commissioner. The state's coastal marshland laws recommend that the Committee always find certain projects, like the construction of dump sites and mining, contrary to the public interest. https://epd.georgia.gov/rules-and-laws 83115
