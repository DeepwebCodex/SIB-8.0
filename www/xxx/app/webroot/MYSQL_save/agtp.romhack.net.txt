2007-03-07 14:49:29 Announcement Gideon Zhi Welcome to the new Aeon Genesis! We have, as I´m sure you can tell, undergone some substantial changes. The website is still not 100% functional, but the core works - current news and projects, at least. Old news will probably end up in html files linked from somewhere (possibly another news post.)<br /><br />The new site is great! It´s all PHP-powered for ease of updating, it´s a hell of a lot cleaner server-side than the old one, and we even have some fun new things like the Random Completed Project pane on your right and the randomized banner up at the top of each page. The title quote rerandomizes on each page, as well!<br /><br />Most importantly, however, is that the new system allows me to grant posting accounts to other people (translators, utility writers, script proofers, what-have-you.) This will be the first time that other voices will be heard on the front page, and I´m very, very excited about it! The old setup made it seem like Aeon Genesis was just me - and while I am the primary hacker for nearly all of our projects (La-Mulana being the exception) the truth of the matter is that there are a lot of other people working with me to help get these games to the masses.<br /><br />So yes, welcome to the new Aeon Genesis! Do be sure to thank <a href="http://www.snesmusic.org/">Datschge of SNESMusic.org</a> and <a href="http://sa-two.yuudachi.net">satsu</a> for their help with the PHP and CSS! I appreciate the aid very, very much! The annual release will occur later today. (Sorry to disappoint, but the release is <i>not</i> a Super Robot War.)
2007-03-07 15:32:09 Progress laplace,puzzlepuyo2, Gideon Zhi Project Name Changes "Demon of Laplace" has had its name changed to "Laplace´s Demon" to more accurately represent the mathematical/philosophic concept it deals with. Similarly, "Super Nazo Puyo 2" has been renamed as "Super Puzzle Puyo 2" to properly reflect its translated name.
2007-03-07 15:35:29 Announcement srwalpha Gideon Zhi Super Robot Wars Alpha!! I´m making this post not only to announce the SRW Alpha project, but to also announce that its script is already nearly 90% complete - that´s six <i>megabytes</i> of text! Some sample screenshots are up on its project page.<br /><br />The translation was by Tyria (even more of a robot than I am); as usual, his writing is quite accurate but makes for horrid reading, so we´re taking pains to get it proofed and polished up for public consumption. No estimates on how long this will take, sorry.
2007-03-07 19:20:55 Major Release shodai Gideon Zhi Kunio Release - Oh god, this is so much easier So yeah, here´s the release I promised for today. <a href="project.php?id=shodai">Shodai Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun</a>, AKA "River City Ransom 2" although that´s not really correct at all. I´ve included a bit of a mini-manual with the patch to help you through some problem spots with items and gameplay mechanics, so be sure to read it!
2007-03-20 01:18:59 Progress darklaw Gideon Zhi Dark Law is nearly done. Here are a few statistics:<br /><br />Assembly code (so far) in Dark Law: 102KB. Number of variable-width font hacks: 6 (so far - it probably needs at least two more.) Amount of raw text: 232,112 bytes. Number of advils taken: 10 (best guess.)<br /><br />Here are some of the features you can expect to see in the final version:<br />--Fully variable-width menus<br />--Expanded list files for enemies, spells, and items. Originally fixed at 8 characters max, I now have as much screen and romspace as necessary.<br />--Expanded names for NPC characters - originally 6 characters max, "Antoniana" now fits.<br />--Expanded names for scenarios and locales - originally 8 characters max, I now have 256 pixels of space available for both.<br />--Expanded names for jobs (originally fixed at <i>three characters</i> on the subscreen, should be able to fit up to seven 16x16 tiles.<br /><br />I´ve updated the screenshots slideshow on the <a href="http://agtp.romhack.net/project.php?id=darklaw">project page</a> to reflect the new progress. It´s hires, so be sure to click the slideshow to bring up full-resolution screenshots. Here are a few samples:<br /><br /><img src="images/news/darklaw0.png" alt="Dark Law" /> <img src="images/news/darklaw12.png" alt="Dark Law" />
2007-03-23 03:43:22 Progress darklaw Gideon Zhi Dark Law enters playtesting. Dark Law ~ Meaning of Death has entered playtesting. It´s not without issues; there´s still some rather nasty problems with the auto-center routines, especially when item descriptions or number variables factor into the equation, but it´s looking mighty fine enough already.<br /><br />Currently, the patch is 360K. I've hacked thirteen font routines for this sucker - 8 variable-width ones, two 8x16 fixed routines, and three 8x8s. The amount of code that's gone into this is mind boggling!<br /><br />I expect to release the patch on Wednesday, in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the game´s original release.<br /><br /><img src="http://agtp.romhack.net/images/news/darklaw03232007.png" alt="Dark Law" /> <img src="http://agtp.romhack.net/images/news/darklaw032320072.png" alt="Dark Law" />
2007-03-28 21:05:06 Major Release darklaw Gideon Zhi Dark Law was released ten years ago today. I refer, of course, to the original game. Now, however, ten years later, it is available in English for the first time. Despite the amount of effort that went into this (it has, by far, more assembly code in it than Rudra had) I am somehow lacking in things to say, other than that I hope you enjoy the patch and the game!
2007-04-02 17:15:33 Progress fe3 Gideon Zhi New Fire Emblem screenshots. I´ve added sixteen new screenshots to Fire Emblem´s project page. These completely replace the old screenshots (all two of them) and are indicative of the project´s current status. A lot of rewriting still needs to be done - I´ve done maybe 7 chapters of 45 or more - but it´s getting places, slowly but surely.
2007-04-05 03:51:15 Progress tactics Gideon Zhi Tactics Ogre not crashing... nearly as often About an hour´s worth of detective work tonight discovered the nature of what appear to be the remainder of Tactics Ogre´s dialogue crashes. It´s still not exactly performing to spec; if you try to save, the game basically explodes, and it´s still displaying memory card messages as an artifact from the PSX release. Might have to get that block retranslated... but eh. I otherwise played through three scenarios with no major problems (although I did hit a few minor ones.)<br /><br />Here are some images.<br /><img src="http://agtp.romhack.net/images/news/tactics040507.png" alt="Tactics Ogre"/> <img src="http://agtp.romhack.net/images/news/tactics0405072.png" alt="Tactics Ogre"/>
2007-04-12 04:23:48 Miscellaneous mmr Gideon Zhi Metal Max Nearly Ready for Beta Just a quick post to air out an old project. I picked Metal Max Returns up a few days ago with the intention of finishing it; lo and behold, it´s nearly done. I´m _NOT_ going to be expanding character names, I´m afraid - the menu alterations would just be too much work - but otherwise, I think it looks pretty good.<br /><br />I´ve finally finished translating the shops, I think, and I´m working on the subscreen now. Afterwards, I may have one or two things to tinker with in combat, one word to translate on the BSCon, and a few town names to center in a few menus, and it´ll be ready for testing!<br /><br />I don´t know about anyone else, but I´m seriously excited about this project. The game offers tons of customization options for the enterprising tank fiend, plus a fair amount of bonus games and optional material for you to do when you´re not hunting bounty heads. Here are a few snapshots indicative of current progress. As I progress I´ll be replacing the old screenshot slideshow with new meat, so be sure to be on the lookout for that as well.<br /><img src="../images/news/metalmax014.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /> <img src="../images/news/metalmax015.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" />
2012-11-09 15:32:01 Progress smtif Gideon Zhi Quick progress report on if... Just dropping a quick head&#180;s up here that SMT if...&#180;s text translation is done. Its hacking currently looks identical to SMT2&#180;s, but with added main dialog proportional font. I&#180;d LIKE to clean up the hacking a bit though, and the majority of the text isn&#180;t inserted yet - in fact, I still don&#180;t actually have it. It&#180;s still on Ian&#180;s computer, and he unfortunately got smacked pretty badly by Hurricane Sandy and is currently mostly without internet access. Still no ETA.<br /><br /><a href="/pantheon/index.php?topic=567">Discuss this news</a>
2013-04-13 22:24:56 Major Release jojo Gideon Zhi JoJo´s Bizarre SNES Translation A week late, admittedly. Sorry about that, but school kind of got in the way, and a few nasty unexpected issues crept up during the playtest. It should be all fixed now, though!<br /><br />For the uninitiated, this is an RPG based on Stardust Crusaders (<a href="http://yojimbo.eludevisibility.org/" target="_blank">no relation</a>), the third arc of JoJo´s Bizarre Adventure. It´s a reasonably okay game, not great but not bad either. If you´re a fan of the source material, you´ll probably get the most appreciation out of it. Enjoy!<br /><img src="/images/news/2013-04-1418.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /> <img src="/images/news/2013-04-1417.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /><br /><br /><a href="/pantheon/index.php?topic=570">Discuss this news</a>
2013-04-25 16:20:22 Progress royalstone Gideon Zhi Major Progress on Royal Stone Just dropping a quick word about Royal Stone&#180;s recent dramatic progress. In the last few weeks TheMajinZenki, who you might know as the translator for the recent JoJo&#180;s patch, has been tearing through the game&#180;s script. All of the text unrelated to the actual progression of the story has been inserted, though admittedly only about 90% of it works correctly at the moment. He&#180;s also translated roughly the first two thirds of the main story dialog; I&#180;ve edited and inserted about half of that. I&#180;ve also done a huge pile of work on the technical aspects of the project, including cracking the compression the game uses for its introduction and its combat menus, as well as the sprite data it uses for pause menus. The game is currently playable with only minor issues through Round 5, and all this in the space of a couple of weeks!<br /><br />I&#180;ve taken 24 screenshots, some of which you may recognize but most of which are new. With a little luck I should have more news for you soon!<br /><img src="/images/news/2013-04-2510.png" alt="Screenshot" width="160" height="144" /> <img src="/images/news/2013-04-257.png" alt="Screenshot" width="160" height="144" /><br /><br /><a href="/pantheon/index.php?topic=571">Discuss this news</a>
2013-10-04 07:18:03 Announcement srw2 Gideon Zhi Welcoming SRW2 Back Into the Fold Over the years I can think of exactly three projects I&#180;ve ever completely dropped - that is, three projects I removed from the website entirely. One of those was the Japanese version of Castlevania 2: Simon&#180;s Quest, which is now being done by <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php/topic,15524.0.html" target="_blank">these fine folk here</a>. The second was Granhistoria, an odd little RPG published by Banpresto on the Super Famicom, but I&#180;m not going to be talking about Granhistoria... at least, not today. Today I&#180;m announcing the triumphant return of the Super Robot Wars 2 translation.<br /><br />I&#180;ve honestly been poking at SRW2 on and off for quite some time. Several years back I was given a hack to help with some extra text space, though I don&#180;t believe this ever found its way into the current build of the translation. I&#180;d redumped the game&#180;s script at around that time and would mention it offhand to people who might be interested, but it was never really a priority.<br /><br />So last February I re-redumped the script and gave it to TheMajinZenki, who was responsible for the JoJo&#180;s Bizarre Adventure and Royal Stone text translations. (He and I have a few other things brewing by the way, but nothing I&#180;m really willing to talk too much about just yet.) He returned the script to me a month later, and I immediately set to work trying to get it back into the game - only to discover that one of the text banks was badly over-size and that the routine printing said text was shared by a number of the larger graphic elements of the game, so my usual trickery would not work. It was back to the old slash-and-burn tactics of pruning it bit-by-bit until it finally fit into its bank. This is thankless work, and at the time I was busy with my last semester of higher education and still working a full-time job, so SRW2 was not a priority. I also wanted to see if I could manage some kind of workaround for the text, but everything was coming up blank.<br /><br />Well, this past Monday I sat down with the file and pruned it &#180;til it fit. I&#180;m not proud of some of the cuts I had to make, but the perfect is the enemy of the good as the saying goes and SRW2 looks pretty good as it is. Then over the next two days I got the rest of the text inserted and hacked up a couple of routines, and now the project is very nearly done; all that really remains is for someone to come in and clean up Zenki&#180;s script a bit and we&#180;ll be ready for testing.<br /><br />So! Hopefully this will be out soon. I&#180;ve been poking a couple of hornets&#180; nests in the hopes of getting an editor to come chasing after the script with all the fervor of an angry hive but so far nobody&#180;s really bitten. We&#180;ll see how things progress from here.<br /><br />Incidentally, those of you who&#180;ve played both older and newer SRWs will appreciate a fairly small hack I performed on SRW2 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6DQpHaw4cg" target="_blank">to get the robots&#180; battle theme music to stay after combat scenes end</a>. This will be provided with the patch as an optional accessory, and as a bonus it doesn&#180;t even need the translation - if you prefer playing the game in Japanese for whatever reason, the music patch will still work. I&#180;ll be providing a patch to reverse the hack as well.<br /><img src="/images/news/2013-10-040.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /> <img src="/images/news/2013-10-044.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /><br /><br /><a href="/pantheon/index.php?topic=573">Discuss this news</a>
2013-10-30 17:44:41 Progress ys5 Gideon Zhi Ys 5 Can Now Be Beaten Back in May, I quietly discovered several reasons that Ys 5&#180;s translation was crashing the game. I counted at least 60 such bugs, all of which caused the game to die in horrible ways, and despite having those fixed for his most recent playthrough in the last couple of weeks Deuce still encountered over a dozen more crashes, several of which required modification to compressed assembly code, which is really nasty business. Regardless, the game can now be beaten without it crashing, and as sad as it may sound this is a massive step forward for the project.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not to say that the game is done, or even close. The text still needs to be edited, there is still a large amount of menu work that needs to be done, and some of the game&#180;s visual effects are broken. Examples of the broken stuff will be found in <a href="https://twitter.com/GideonZhi/media" target="_blank">my twitter gallery</a>, but the game&#180;s gallery page has been updated with 23 fresh screenshots of functional text.<br /><br />This is one of a few projects I&#180;d like to have done by the end of the year. Due to a variety of circumstances (including a job hunt) I&#180;m not sure if that&#180;s going to be possible, but it&#180;d certainly be nice! <br /><img src="/images/news/2013-10-311.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /> <img src="/images/news/2013-10-312.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /><br /><br /><a href="/pantheon/index.php?topic=598">Discuss this news</a>
2013-11-10 11:21:41 Announcement twinbeerba Gideon Zhi Announcing TwinBee, Plus Other News For those of you who&#180;ve been following me on Twitter this won&#180;t exactly be news, but I&#180;m finally announcing a translation project for TwinBee Rainbow Bell Adventure. It&#180;s a cute little platformer for the SNES with a bit of Sonic, a bit of Rocket Knight, and a bit of Mario World all thrown into a blender. Casual fans may note that this did in fact come out in PAL regions; diehard fans will note that said PAL release was heavily stripped-down. The translation restores all that content - the dialog, the endings, the secret exits and twisty map, and the battery-backed saves. It&#180;s almost done, too; unless something goes seriously wrong, expect it within the next week or so.<br /><br />In other news, SRW2&#180;s betatest progresses well. We&#180;ve hit one major issue: a buffer overflow with the unit screen which I&#180;m not quite sure how to fix just yet. But things are otherwise fairly clean, so hopefully that&#180;ll be out by the end of the year.<br /><br />Also, hacking for Ys 5 has been completed as well. The edit progresses apace, and we&#180;re hoping to have the translation out on Thanksgiving Day. Of course, given how beastly the project has been, things could always go badly awry in the meantime. Keep your fingers crossed!<br /><img src="/images/news/2013-11-101.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /> <img src="/images/news/2013-11-107.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /><br /><br /><a href="/pantheon/index.php?topic=599">Discuss this news</a>
2013-11-14 16:20:55 Major Release twinbeerba Gideon Zhi TwinBee Rainbow Bell Adventure Launches Today sees the release of TwinBee Rainbow Bell Adventure for the SNES! Translation is 100% complete, so enjoy! I´m not going to claim that this is the best platformer on the SNES or even that it´s one of the best, as it frankly can´t hold a candle to Mario, Metroid, Megaman X or Front Mission Gun Hazard (yes, I went there!) But it´s still a damn good game, and if you´re itching for a cute but challenging platformer with plenty of secrets to find, here´s a great chance to have a good scratch.<br /><br />I´m currently planning another release for two weeks from today. Fingers crossed!<br /><img src="/images/news/2013-11-155.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /> <img src="/images/news/2013-11-159.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /><br /><br /><a href="/pantheon/index.php?topic=605">Discuss this news</a>
2013-11-28 00:01:23 Major Release ys5 Gideon Zhi Ys 5, At Long Last I must admit, I am at a loss for words writing this. Ys 5 has been a trial in so many ways and it has been in the works for so long that I don&#180;t feel like I could do it justice in a one- or two-paragraph blurb. As such, I will let the translation speak for itself: it is without issue (that I know of), and includes some fairly substantial under-the-hood modifications to data storage and menu structures. Despite how bumpy the road has been, or perhaps because of it, I am intensely proud of this release. Enjoy!<br /><br />As a further note, earlier this week XSeed Games released Memories of Celceta for the PS Vita, and their Ys releases on Steam are currently on sale. If you enjoy Ys 5 and haven&#180;t bought any other titles in the series, please give XSeed your business. In celebration I&#180;ve updated the translation of Ys 4 Mask of the Sun, of which Memories of Celceta is a remake. This update brings some of the terminology in line with XSeed&#180;s version and includes various other fixes to the text, including the nasty glitchy too-long strings that erased bits of the frame.<br /><br />Lastly, I&#180;ve updated TwinBee Rainbow Bell Adventure with a minor fix to the Battle mode screen.<br /><br />I&#180;m going to attempt to keep up a bi-weekly release schedule for the foreseeable future, but I don&#180;t like to make any hard-and-fast promises for something like this unless I&#180;ve already got something very nearly ready for release. I think I can manage it for at least two more, though!<br /><br />In any case, Ys 5 is now available. Enjoy!<br /><img src="/images/news/2013-11-280.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /> <img src="/images/news/2013-11-288.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /><br /><br /><a href="/pantheon/index.php?topic=641">Discuss this news</a>
2013-12-12 09:35:05 Major Release royalstone Gideon Zhi Royal Stone I have an awful lot to do today, so I´m going to keep this short. Royal Stone is done! It´s a neat strategy/RPG for the Game Gear, and it´s the sequel to Crystal Warriors if you´re familiar with that. It´s a dramatic improvement over its predecessor and is easily one of the prettiest games on the platform. Enjoy!<br /><img src="/images/news/2013-12-1210.png" alt="Screenshot" width="160" height="144" /> <img src="/images/news/2013-12-127.png" alt="Screenshot" width="160" height="144" /><br /><br /><a href="/pantheon/index.php?topic=675">Discuss this news</a>
2013-12-24 06:47:26 Major Release srw2 Gideon Zhi Super Robot Wars 2... twofer! Happy non-denominational holiday! As Banpresto celebrates the announcement of SRW Z3 and a high-definition remake of the very first SRW, so too does Aeon Genesis. Launching today is the English version of Super Robot Wars 2 for the NES, with a heaping plateful of extras! Included is the previously-advertised <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6DQpHaw4cg" target="_blank">optional music persistence patch</a> as well as a patch that will completely remove the hack should you decide you don´t like it. But wait, that´s not all! Thanks to RHDN music guru optomon, we´ve replaced the awkwardly muzaky <i>Tobe! Gundam</i> theme song with <i>Gallant Char</i>, the track used in for UC units in SRW3, EX, and 4. As with music persistence, this patch is entirely optional, comes with a removal patch, and can be applied with any combination of the translation and music persistence patch, or it can just be applied on its own!<br /><br />As if that weren´t enough, all this is releasing alongside a similarly-complete translation for the <a href="http://agtp.romhack.net/project.php?id=gbasrw2">officially-emulated version of Super Robot Wars 2 on the GameBoy Advance!!</a> I´ve managed to insert the NES translation into the Famicom Mini version of the game that was released in limited quantities as a promotional contest item. It´s probably inferior to the NES version, but hey, more options! Good stuff. Music Persistence and Gallant Char are both fully functional with the FamiMini version of the game as well, and are included as optional patches (and removal patches) with the translation. Now, this hasn´t been tested extensively, and might be prone to weird issues that may or may not be caused by the translation. It´s really hard to tell, and honestly it was thrown together pretty quickly as a what-if effort. Please report issues and findings on The Pantheon.<br /><img src="/images/news/2013-12-2418.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /> <img src="/images/news/2013-12-2414.png" alt="Screenshot" width="256" height="224" /><br /><br /><a href="/pantheon/index.php?topic=684">Discuss this news</a>

Shiren the Wanderer: Mysterious Dungeon 2 Fushigi no Dungeon 2 - Shiren the Wanderer 1995-12-01 SNES Roguelike 100 1 2006-03-07 1.00 2006-03-07 0000-00-00 00:00:00 Chunsoft FnS is one of those random dungeon games, and it&acute;s a damn good one at that. The main character, Shiren, is on a quest to reach the top of mount-something-or-other, which nobody&acute;s ever reached the top of. That&acute;s about the gist of it. &acute;course there&acute;s a LOT more depth to the game, but it being in Japanese at the current time sorta puts a hamper on my knowledge of the game :P The dungeon generation routine is pretty advanced though, and the enemies are very interesting! It&acute;s also tough as nails, so be warned!<br /><br />Everything&acute;s pretty much done, so enjoy! 73565 245 shiren
Star Fox 2 0000-00-00 SNES Shooter 100 1 2004-10-07 1.00 2004-10-07 0000-00-00 00:00:00 Nintendo/Argonaut Software [Unpublished] Ah, the prototype to end all prototypes. No, Star Fox 2 was never officially released. I will not go into how the game found its way onto the internet, as that is not my place. I will say that it&acute;s a helluvalotta fun! At the beginning, you&acute;re presented with a map of the Lylat system, with a few different things happening on it depending on which difficulty level you select. As soon as you move your chosen pilots to a different place on the map, things start happening and will continue to happen until you either A) change pilots by pressing select, or B) complete a level. Things will even continue to happen while you&acute;re battling through a battleship, planet, missile salvo, boss, or fighter squadron. Don&acute;t let things get too close to Corneria, though -- if the planet takes too much damage, it&acute;s game over!<br /><br />Another really cool thing that the game does is add incentives for playing the higher difficulty levels. The normal mode seems kind of cool at first, but it gets old pretty quickly. Kick the difficulty up to "Hard" and you have more planets to rescue, more battleships to destroy, more enemies and bosses flying around the map. And by the way, the battleship and planet levels&acute; layouts have changed! It&acute;s really something else. The same things happen when you kick it up to "Expert" -- even more new and changed things.<br /><br />If that weren&acute;t enough, there are huge General Pepper coins strewn throughout each difficulty level. Each one only appears once -- after you pick it up, it will not appear in future playthroughs. I&acute;m unsure of the function of these, other than to fully heal you when you find one, but I&acute;ve yet to find them all. My running total is 27 or 28...<br /><br />Everything&acute;s done, and there are two versions of the patch -- one which just applies the translation (the "debug" version) and one which attempts to remove the non-functional bits and debug functions, to simulate what the game would look like if it were finished. Please be aware that there are a -lot- of different versions of the game floating around; this patch will work on at most three of them, but will not function on poor, earlier versions. Also note that the game&acute;s particularly picky insofar as emulators are concerned, so before complaining that the patch doesn&acute;t work, try the game unpatched to make sure that doesn&acute;t crash your emulator. It ought to work on the roms that goodsnes has labelled "Beta TD" and "J o1" (which is funny, &acute;cuz the so-called overdump is actually the right size :p) 130149 191 starfox2
Treasure of the Rudras Rudra no Hihou 1996-04-05 SNES RPG 10 1 2003-07-04 2.00 2006-07-04 0000-00-00 00:00:00 Squaresoft <p>Please note: Rudra uses the SNES' hires display mode for its text. If the font looks kinda blurry (especially the half-width combat and area font) click on the picture to pop up a new window with a double-sized slideshow at the "real" resolution.

<p>Treasure of the Rudras is the last RPG with a "normal" battle system that Square produced for the SNES, with the exception of maybe Chrono Trigger which might have come after it. Regardless, a fan translation was long thought impossible due to the game's system of magic - it let players enter their own words into a screen similar to the one where they name their characters, and it would generate effects based on the words that the players typed in! Well, as my screenshots demonstrate, that system has been completely conquered, to the point where I've not only englishized it, but also doubled the number of letters per spell name! And don't let the graphics deceive you - the game's stat progression plays much more like a Dragon Warrior game than it does a Final Fantasy. Don't expect an easy ride, because you are -not- going to get one! Some of the bosses are positively nasty!</p>

<p>The story follows three humans, each of which holds a stone called a "Jade", as they work to stop the impending destruction of all life on their planet. They only have 16 days, and time will pass as they complete events - often times their scenarios, although separate, will intersect and a scene will take place between the two parties. Once all three scenarios have been completed, a fourth scenario opens as the story reaches its climax.</p>

<p>The new version, released on July 4, 2006, contains numerous improvements over the initial release. The font is now variable-width, the text has been completely retooled and polished, the opening's been rehacked, the battle menu's been moved to allow for two extra letters per enemy name, and a few smaller fixes have been implemented. Suffice it to say that this new version of the patch is the definitive English-language Treasure of the Rudras!</p>

<p>As a further note, today (June 12 2015) I've launched version 2.1 beta. There are some not-inconsequential changes to the way spells are handled in combat and it hasn't been fully tested, so I'm leaving it as an extra for now. If nobody reports any problems within a few weeks I'll promote it and replace v2.0 with this.</p> <a href="http://agtp.romhack.net/extra/rudra-e.zip">v2.1 beta</a> 101249 267 rnh
Accelebrid 1993-11-26 SNES Shooter 10 1 2002-05-28 1.00 2002-05-28 0000-00-00 00:00:00 Tomy Accelebrid is a chase-view shooter. I guess it might be compared to Iridion 3D, but as I haven't played Iridion 3D, I wouldn't know. Basically, you play as this guy named Ginei, who happens to be the pilot of the Silver Mare, an eight-or-so foot tall, high-powered suit of armor, armed to the teeth, which he races. The upcoming race is the 13th famed Accelebrid, and it's being held at the G. Bowman circuit. During the race, however, a group of terrorists attacks, hijacks the tracks built-in obstacles, and kidnaps the owner of Ginei's team (who also happens to be his girlfriend or something.) Armed with nothing but vengeance and his high-powered combat suit, Ginei leaves in hot pursuit.

You've got a radar at the bottom of the screen which you will NEED to get used to using if you want to survive. The game also sports six different weapons with which to arm the Silver Mare, as well as multiple possible endings to the game. Translation's totally taken care of (not like you need it to play the game, but still.) Have fun! 59776 169 accelebrid
Shin Nekketsu Kouha: Kunio-tachi no Banka 1994-04-29 SNES Beatemup 100 1 2002-09-20 1.00 2002-09-20 0000-00-00 00:00:00 Technos Japan Corp It&acute;s Kunio. It&acute;s a beatemup. It&acute;s fun. Whee. For those who don&acute;t know what I&acute;m talking about, it all started (to my knowledge) with a game called Nekketsu Kouha - Kunio-kun which was released in the States as Renegade. That game&acute;s quite a bit less popular than its cousin which came out here as River City Ransom, also starring Kunio and Riki. This game is the sequel to the original Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun, so don&acute;t expect the RPG elements that RCR had in this. It&acute;s still quite a fun game, though, and it&acute;s LONG for a beatemup.<br /><br />The story, basically, is that Kunio got in a hit-&acute;n-run accident where he ran a red light and hit a man in a crosswalk, or something. Of course, he didn&acute;t really do it; we learn within the first few minutes of the game that there&acute;s a Kunio lookalike parading around Tokyo, and he&acute;s likely the one who really got into the accident. It&acute;s up to Kunio to clear his name, but he&acute;s stuck in the juvenile detention center! 58385 180 banka
Shin Megami Tensei 1992-10-30 SNES RPG 100 1 2002-06-30 1.00 2002-06-30 0000-00-00 00:00:00 Atlus This game is amazing. The story is deep and involving (literally), the game is long (expect to spend about 50 hours on it), the graphics are amazing for 1992, and the gameplay rewards experimentation and is full of micromanagement. This is very much one of the best RPGs for the SNES that I&acute;ve ever played. The player is a demon summoner, thrust into the middle of a war in modern-day and futuristic Tokyo. Shin Megami Tensei is unique in that rather than force you onto one side or the other, the game presents both sides&acute; arguments equally and leaves you, the player, to make the final choice for yourself. This game is incredible, and everyone should try go play it. NOW. 216806 361 smt

Example: during the introduction sequence it is revealed that his flight is running late, so in order to make sure that he´s on time for the opening ceremonies at the school, the stewardess pushes him out of the plane with a faulty parachute. Hourai features plenty of penguins, wacky clubs, and crazy school hijinks. It also features a class system similar to FF5´s, or so I hear - you join clubs, and as you rank higher in the clubs you gain more abilities.<br /><br /> satsu´s translated this one.

This version, other than having an amazingly badass logo, is actually a lot harder than the US release of the game. Even in Fillmore 1, there are more brambles, more monsters, more everything. It&acute;s crazy great. Ian Kelley wanted to retranslate the game, so here it is! Far be it from me to deprive one of my star translators from an awesome request or two!<br /><br />If you&acute;ve never played it, now&acute;s your chance. The translation is complete and, to my knowledge, bug-free. Enjoy! 66844 176 actraiser

It&acute;s also more fantasy oriented than your typical Megaten, but that&acute;s okay! It&acute;s also based off of the Last Bible mythos, sorta, and Last Bible was released stateside as Revelations: The Demon Slayer or something. It&acute;s a pretty fun game all-around, and it&acute;s easy to play. Translation&acute;s done, have fun! 75528 175 anotherbible
Assault Suits Valken 1992-12-19 SNES Action 100 1 2004-03-07 1.00 2004-03-07 0000-00-00 00:00:00 NCS/Masaya Assault Suits Valken is an amazing action game by NCS/Masaya. Easily one of my favorite SNES games of all time, Valken puts you into the cockpit of a gigantic robot that gets to stomp over everything in its path. The levels are extremely well varied and I have yet to really get sick of it. In fact, looks and feels very similar to Front Mission: Gun Hazard. I may go so far as to say it inspired Gun Hazard, but I really can&acute;t confirm that one way or the other. Assault Suits Valken one hell of a lot of fun, and it&acute;s got really good story to back it up, too -- quite a lot of which was unfortunately lost on Konami, who released it as "Cybernator" in the US. They removed a good 30-60% of the text, a lot of text sequences, character portraits in the dialogue, reduced one character to simple cannon fodder, deleted a whole bunch of other characters, axed a cutscene in the final level, and generally made a mess of it. I have, in large part, fixed all that.<br /><br />In the current version, the only thing that should not be working is name customization, so you&acute;ll have to make do with the default of "Jake" for now unless you feel like messing with the half-hacked name entry screen. Otherwise, it should be fully functional! Hope you have a blast! 66602 205 asv
Super Robot Wars 4 Dai 4 Ji Super Robot Taisen 1995-03-17 SNES Strategy/RPG 60 0 0000-00-00 0.00 0000-00-00 0000-00-00 00:00:00 Winkysoft Banpresto (This information is second-hand. It might or might not be accurate, and if it is inaccurate it will be replaced as soon as a better summary can be found.) Super Robot Wars 4 features the return of the aliens from SRW3, who have become known as the "Inspectors." They&acute;re back to retrieve some of the technology they left behind - the capability to use a singularity, or black hole, as a robot&acute;s power source. The main character&acute;s unit, which starts off as a lowly Gespenst, is powered by the black hole engine developed by Shuu Shirakawa using the alien technology. The gameplay has improved substantially from SRW3 and EX; SRW4 introduces a new system for counterattacking on a situational basis that becomes the core of the SRW series from then on. It&acute;s also much prettier!<br /><br />Script is, for the most part, fully translated at this point, but I&acute;m focusing my efforts on getting SRW Gaiden ready before I really buckle down and get to work on this. In the meantime, if anyone&acute;s reading this and has experience in dealing with the SPC700 and would like to help me reverse-engineer the highlighting in the karaoke mode, please contact me ASAP! 83366 122 srw4

However, the threat is being kept under wraps by the military group called the Titans who took control after the end of the war, disarming the SDF and Londo Bell forces. Alpha Gaiden tells the story of the Aegis Project, a gigantic barrier system generated with the power of all the super robots in the world.<br /><br />What we have here is a mostly-complete beta patch. There are several known issues, so do be sure to read the readme and apprise yourself of them. You should be able to enjoy it quite well as it is, though!<br /><br />Quoth Fortemaster: Here`s the rule: You don't complain, because it`s a PSX translated SRW. So unless you can find legitimate, official examples of why we're wrong about a name, keep your complaints about names to yourself. 195131 307 srwag

But then, I´m a Super Robot Wars fan, so of course I say it rules. However, in this case there´s no shortage of people (many of which aren´t regular SRW fans) who´ll back me up on this ;) Aside from Shin Super Robot Wars on the PlayStation, this and its immediate and somewhat recent sequels the only (to my knowledge) non-SD SRW strategy titles. Also, unlike all of the other SRW games, SRWG focuses entirely on Masaki Andoh, the Elemental Lord Cybuster, and the rest of the Lord of Elemental crew in the world of La Gias. Basically, this is Masaki´s story, and it´s told from beginning to end, so you don´t need to worry about any Gundam stuff of Mazinger stuff if that kinda thing scares you (heh.)<br /><br />The script has been entirely retranslated by TheMajinZenki and edited by Cait. It`s been completely hacked from the ground up with a fully proportional font and automatic linebreak detecion.  As with SRW2 we`re even providing a music persistence patch! 106460 298 srwg

In all honesty, this is not a retranslation of any sort - I´ve just dropped the official Playstation script into the game, and although I will be twinking it here and there for grammar and such, it´s mostly fine. It IS done and I am frankly sick of looking at it.

Ys V - Kefin, Lost City of Sand Ys V - Ushinawareta Suna no Miyako Kefin 1995-12-29 SNES Action/RPG 99 1 2013-11-28 1.00 2013-11-28 0000-00-00 00:00:00 Nihon Falcom At the end of December, 1995, Falcom released Ys V for the Super Famicom, choosing to take a gamble and radically alter the gameplay formula of the series to mixed reviews. The game is now much more in the vein of Zelda, though it's not nearly so involved as those games. New to the series is the ability to jump and manually swing your sword/hold up your shield, as well as a rather interesting magic system, based around the notion of alchemy. Different spells are created by combining three elements of varying types, for a decent amount of variety. The game received a bit of a lashing in the press for how easy it was, and an update, Ys V Expert, was released only three months later. This update primarily raised the difficulty and added a time attack mode. <br /> <br />The game spent many years as the sole entry in the Ys series never to have been seen in English, in any form, and for good reason; the process of hacking this game has been a nightmare and has been plagued with dozens upon dozens of crashes. Said crashes were crippling to my motivation to work on the game, but the translation is now complete. Enjoy! 135953 291 ys5
Super Robot Wars Super Robot Taisen 1991-04-20 GB Strategy/RPG 99 1 2007-05-20 1.00 2007-05-20 0000-00-00 00:00:00 Winkysoft Banpresto This is the game that started it all. As such, well, it´s not that great. But it´s a relatively easy hack, and it´s interesting to see how far the series has since come. The plot is relatively lean in comparison - Girgilgun has attacked the Super Robot homeworld, and is using an electromagnetic ray to mind-control most of the Super Robots into doing his bidding! But a few have managed to shake the shackles of Girgilgun´s control, and are fighting back. That´s it, really.<br /><br />To quell any rumors before they begin, this is a continuation of strag0´s old v0.7 patch you can find floating around (with his blessing.) It was really more like .3, but yeah... I´ve fixed all of the attack names and robot names. They all fit in the ROM, full length, with no clipping... of course, some had to be shortened for screen space consideration, but them´s the breaks. I fit in what I could!<br /><br />For hilarity, try squeezing "Diffusion Mega Particle Cannon" into the gameboy´s tiny screen! 100394 185 srw1
LUNAR Walking School LUNAR Sanposuru Gakuen 1996-01-12 GG RPG 99 1 2009-12-17 1.00 2009-12-17 0000-00-00 00:00:00 Game Arts / Studio Alex Game Arts LUNAR Walking School (so called, I´m guessing, because the main characters do an awful lot of walking) is the one LUNAR game that has never seen an English release. It´s a bit different from the main storyline; it´s more lighthearted, there´s no major world-destroying disaster pending, and there aren´t any continents to traverse, only really the small island on which the school resides.<br /><br />Said school, incidentally, is not Vane. This confused me when I first played the game in Japanese - the kids walked onto an actual island in the sea, and here I am thinking "What the hell, Vane flies in the sky!" Turns out it´s Iyen, a sort of sleep-away high school to Vane´s college. It still moves around in the ocean, but you never actually see this - you´re just told that it moves, and new bridges occasionally show up when it´s "near" certain places. It is this school to which our main characters Ellie and Lena are sent at the start of the game, and where they spend most of the duration.<br /><br />The game, in my opinion, is just so-so. The battles are as fast as they can be (made slightly slower by menus that take longer to draw than necessary) but the encounter rate is hair-pullingly bad, especially later in the game. It´s unfortunate because the creators really drilled the importance of magic as a battle tactic into the game; there are plenty of ways, both active and passive, to recover MP, and your spells are MUCH more powerful than your physical attacks. It´s nice to see a battle system where wizards are something more than healers or boss battlers, but the encounter rate dampens that feeling substantially.<br /><br />Insofar as any actual plot is concerned, for the most part each chapter is a stand-alone story. On the upside, this means that the game is extremely episodic, and can easily be picked up from where you left off, especially if it´s at the end of a chapter. On the downside, this means that the game can feel rather disjointed at times, and the overall plot basically boils down to "The Vile Tribe is bad and nasty and is causing problems!"<br /><br />It´s still a decent game, though, and is worth a try if you´re a fan of the series! 60058 200 lunar

Files are linked to from my temp directory (as opposed to news images which are stored separately) so don&#39;t be surprised if they disappear at some point in the indeterminate future.<br /><br />SRW EX<br />[img]http://agtp.romhack.net/temp/srwex000.png[/img] [img]http://agtp.romhack.net/temp/srwex001.png[/img]<br /><br />Dialogue works, needs a looooot of editing. Did training and the first chapter of Masaki&#39;s story; waiting on Excellen for a nondialogue translation.<br /><br />Magical Drop 2<br />[img]http://agtp.romhack.net/temp/md2e001.png[/img]<br />Main dialogue&#39;s in. Endings and tutorials still need dumping... not to mention a lot of graphic replacement needs doing as well.<br /><br />Metal Max Returns<br />[img]http://agtp.romhack.net/temp/metalmax032.png[/img]&nbsp; [img]http://agtp.romhack.net/temp/metalmax026.png[/img]<br />...so continues the playtest... xx
23 10 1 1189650104 1 24 BEFORE POSTING Gideon Zhi aeongen@gmail.com 12.178.87.91 1 1189650275 Datschge Make absolutely sure that you have read the application instructions in your game&#39;s [b]readme[/b] [i]thoroughly[/i] and that you&#39;ve paid extra attention to the header information, particular the exact byte size (NOT the rounded-up megabyte size.) This is IMPORTANT. Users that do not follow this simple rule will receive warnings. The instructions are simple and straightforward, and pity will not be had for those who cannot follow them. xx
25 12 2 1189650296 1 25 RULES!! Simple but strict; adhere to them! Gideon Zhi aeongen@gmail.com 12.178.87.91 1 0 1) Don&#39;t be stupid. This should be easy for most people. Just use your best judgement.<br />2) No ROM requests or links to ROMs and/or ROM sites. Public-domain ROMs are an exception. Pornographic ROMs, regardless of their status in the public domain, are not.<br />3) No requests for patches not yet released, release dates for patches that I am working on, patches that I&#39;m not working on, or prepatched ROM images. Project status requests are allowed provided that said project is not on the main page, and similar requests are not currently on the board.<br />4) Proper spelling, punctuation, and grammar is generally expected of native-level speakers. This does not mean that typos are illegal; it does mean that a general disregard for the above stated (i.e. internet shorthand) will not be tolerated. This is a message board, not a real-time UT deathmatch; you have as much time as you need to proof and think out your message. This is flexible. So long as you don&#39;t come across as having the IQ of a dung beetle, you should be okay.<br />5) Flaming will not be tolerated, excepting when targetted at those in blatant violation of Rules 1-4. No exceptions. xx

120 18 4 1189824665 11 120 Re: Star Ocean: to the cosmos. Ralff Ralff4@gmail.com 70.109.11.80 1 0 I like Claude&#39;s design, actually. Ratix looks nothing like himself and if that&#39;s Dorn he should be fatter (I don&#39;t know why, I just always imagine Dorn as being fat for some reason). <br /><br />Looks pretty cool, but I don&#39;t have a PSP or a PS3 (nor do I plan on buying either), and SO3 kind of made me stop caring about SO. xx

For example, the Laser Rifle&#39;s beam can be reflected and hit one of your guys instead of the target. I don&#39;t know if the weapon&#39;s power is everything, given this little detail.

Bandai Namco Holdings announced today that as of that date, Banpresto&#39;s console game development will be merged into the Bandai Namco Games fold. That&#39;s right, Super Robot Wars will now be published by the same company that publishes Tekken.<br /><br />The Banpresto name will still be around. The publisher will now focus its efforts on prize machines for arcades.<br /><br />In line with this reorganization, Bandai Namco Holdings is shifting two Banpresto subsidiaries. Pleasure Cast and Hanayashiki, both of which operate amusement facilities, will become subsidiaries of Namco.&quot;<br /><br />So, what do you think about it? I can&#39;t tell if this will be good or bad... xx

Chaos reminds me too much of Nietzsche.<br /><br />EDIT: Okay, the battle against the three archangels was NOT autobattleable.

If there's more than one available in the game, feel free to pluralize the necessary words. 1412892953
7 255 178 3 4 He doesn't have or nor do you get an item called "Robot Parts" when he joins you. I think he's referring to the Robotect items he has equipped. Also "You can equip..." sounds like it's directed towards Gene. 1413239543
8 255 178 3 4 He doesn't have or nor do you get an item called "Robot Parts" when he joins you. It's an item you find in the same area though and it's a one time use item that upgrades robots. 1413239846
9 259 180 3 4 It's likely related to the level up stat bug discussed previously. 1413332574
10 259 180 3 4 It's likely related to the level up stat bug discussed previously and I believe was fixed. It's probably a RAM carry-over from your savestate. 1413332618
91 1049 483 4 4 So right now that means we've got two somewhat different words translated to the same thing:

??/??? = Demons

??/??? = Demon family

Maybe the latter should include the nuance somehow. 1437910537
92 1049 483 4 4 So right now that means we've got two somewhat different words translated to the same thing:

94 1096 500 4 4 Forgot "Bizarre dance" for the final step. 1438443880
95 1096 500 4 4 Forgot "Strange dance" for the final step. 1438443893
96 1109 501 4 4 The final screenshot is "There is/There isn't" 1438453927
97 1109 501 4 4 The final screenshot is "There is/There isn't" in another context. 1438453948
98 1120 519 4 4 It's definitely a reaction to something bad. I tried without an instrument and got the "bad song" tune which got me that same reaction. 1439229747
99 1120 519 4 4 It's definitely a reaction to something bad. I tried without an instrument and got the "bad song" tune which got me that same reaction. Still, this use of "aesthetic" made me laugh. 1439229838

id,description,steps_to_reproduce,additional_information
2 Intro credits need to be hacked.
3 The four graphics with the battlefield names (Forest, Dark Dome, Guillotine Hill, Pseudospace) need to be hacked.
4 "Let the battle bigin!!" Vs kanji needs to be translated. Lift the graphic from SF4?
5 When Tam's in your party (any time between visiting Elec City and the event with Oregi in the basement of Ceram City) you get custom battle messages from him taken from a block in the insert file between 6281-6306. It looks like this is probably related to a typo on line 6281 where a comment is loaded instead of an actual line, but I'd like confirmation on that from a secondary source. Loading the attached savestate should bring you to the end of a battle where the bugged line gets displayed. Any battle where Tam is in your party has a random chance (presumably 1 in 5) of displaying the line at the end of combat.
6 During battles, the Tech menu cursor (pick "Input" and then "Tech" from the start of any battle) has incorrect positioning once you have more than 1 tech to choose from. Enter any battle once you have more than 1 tech, choose "Tech" from the menu and scroll up and down. I've attached a savestate, too.
7 Choosing a vehicle from the garage that you don't have the necessary NavBot for produces a string with incorrect spacing, I assume because I changed "Pilot Robot" to "NavBot" to save space in strings, oops. Go to a Garage and choose a Cruiser or Hoverplane before you have NavBot 2 or 3 in your inventory.
8 Checking the "Kits" inventory menu after you pick up the Power Kit causes a strange display bug where "Power Kit" is displayed on the wrong part of the screen, overwriting the name of another item. From the status menu (press start):
>Pick List
>Pick Kits
9 Tam's dying words during his death cutscene are glitched for whatever reason. Probably related to my changing "Gene" back to "Jin" throughout the insert file. Check the savestate. Load the savestate and walk up two tiles.
10 After selling a bunch of items in a shop, I noticed that scrolling all the way to the right and onto the second inventory page revealed a trio of empty strings named simply "0". Leaving the shop and coming back in causes them to disappear.
11 After arriving at Satellite Base for the first time, Morita leaves the party. After the message telling you this, the game attempts to draw a text box the size of the screen and crashes. Load up the save state I attached and advance the text box to go to Satellite Base. After the message from Morita telling you he's going to leave, the game will crash.
92 I'm pretty sure that it's supposed to be "attack"
93 This text could be formatted better. There's an unnecessary gap of space on the first line.
94 Technically these two strings are not entirely true. Some people are still hanging around.
95 I've seen both of these in the script.
96 It appears that stats values are incorrectly loaded from the ROM. For example, when Gene gets to rank 2, his power stat becomes 194. According to the level up stats in battle, power is supposed to go up by 9. I would hazard a guess that that is the correct stat boost.
97 See screenshots.
98 When Oregi beats you up, the text says something like "Fell into the ravine."
But when you talk to that guy, he says fissure.
99 Ok, so this is just a crazy suggestion, but you're at the bottom of the fissure and basically in the bowels of Fiber City. Just saying...
100 Screenshots.
101 There should be room for HandMissile.
492 Screenshots.
493 Screenshot.
494 Screenshot.
495 Screenshots.
496 Screenshot.
497 I'm thinking it's the target that recovers HP. The spell restores it. The latter would put it more in line with other spell descriptions.
498 Second line's a bit too far.
499 Rukyu lines starting a bit too far to the right.
500 Garbage.
501 They're spelled differently from what's on the list. "FIRE BALL" and "DISPELL" respectively.
992 Screenshot. Yes, No, Not really, Show off, Draw your gun.
993 weak-
willed
994 so he split off?
995 the spell on someone ensnared?
the spell on someone who's been ensnared?
996 The list data looks correct but not everything is initially displayed. Go to the item exchange, scroll down, scroll back up.
997 Mess around and you'll see. Drop Dis-Poison, or anything on the fully scrolled down page and then Dis-Poison. Then scroll around.
998 Screenshots. Unequip or Equip, then cancel, then scroll down.
999 Screenshots from both versions. Scroll down enough to make the top arrow appear.
1000 kill me, don't you? Talk, Overbearing.
1001 Whoops. Talk, Archangel, Friendly, Try talking.
1996 Acquire a spell book from the gryphon, its a "Poison Spray" spell but the dialog says "Plague".

The spell name should be consistent. Acquire a spell book from the gryphon none

id,note
1 Is there any reason to use Jin instead of Gene? They're pronounced the same and the character doesn't particularly *look* Japanese.
2 Gene is ???, the character in the game is ??, which is yeah, a different name. You told me you didn't want to change names from the original, and "Jin" is definitely more accurate to the original, so I went with it. I just kinda lumped it in with a few of the other odd romanization choices in the script (Tac instead of Tam, Redesuma instead of Ledesma, etc.). If you want to change it back, I'm cool with it, but that was my thought process. I also changed "Chris" to "Kris" to make it so we don't have to use squishy characters for her name in combat.
3 I really hate to ask this, but could you please either post SRM saves, or use FCEUX instead of Nestopia? It may not be nearly as accurate but its debugger is second to none and there's no easy way to convert savestates from one to the other. If the reason for a crash isn't immediately apparent in the data I have available then the debugger is an invaluable asset.
4 I can do that going forward, but I'd have to redo every savestate up to this point with a different emulator to replace what I've uploaded so far, right? Probably better to just save that for when we're in testing and have other people who are playing from the beginning (unless you have a better idea)
5 Going forward is good enough for now, yeah. I have a bit more work to do on Dark Half before sending the script off to Amanda, but after that I can devote myself wholly to LP. Hoping to start the test in force by mid-week.
6 Unfortunately, there are a couple of things wrong with this report. The line numbers you're quoting don't match up to anything useful in the insert file, but more importantly, the savestate is unhelpful for a number of reasons:
1) It's too soon. The string loads almost immediately after loading the savestate, so I can't check any of the game's loading logic.
2) It's too soon. Because of the way the NES bankswitches, even if we fixed this and reinserted, it's likely that the bank containing the relevant text is already swapped in, and the changes wouldn't show up.

I'd need a savestate before the battle occurs.
7 Oh. Sorry about that! The savestate has Tam in your party, so just win random battles until it shows up?
8 Also, why weren't the lines I provided from the insert file useful? Here's how that section looks in my copy of the file:
//[$05F904]
#WRITE(lpptrCxxx, $5F16F)
//@傤łȂ<END>
right now.<END>

//[$05F917]
#WRITE(lpptrCxxx, $5F171)
//
9 Not experiencing this in the latest build.
10 Fixed! :D
91 Posted.
92 I can change this, but it also needs to look consistent with the other NPC bios. Can you provide those as well?
93 I put the section break at a natural pause in his sentence structure. It's fine as it is.
94 Appreciate the suggestion, but nah :)
95 Okay, so, changed this to "cleft." It's a *veeeeeeery* loose poop joke (intergluteal cleft).
96 Can you provide either a savestate or Japanese screenshots so we can doublecheck the translation?
97 So of these only the middle needs to be changed, right? Are there any others?
98 Blanked out the kanji to get more room in the font. I'll see about re-adding them.
99 Have you tried replicating this behavior in the unpatched Japanese ROM?
100 I tried it properly just now and included the correct state file from before you enter the city. It's definitely in the original.
491 I was thinking Occults but Magica should work and was used before.
492 Here's the full text of the species ("family") mapping.

Could I get each species romanized so I can check their equivalencies against SMT1 iOS?
493 I think I may have missed some of the conversation. Pasting the full string here...

494 In the meantime, they should all be part of this list which has romanized hovertext for each family: http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Race_and_species
495 Exactly, but staring at that much kanji makes my eyes water :)
496 Part of that was the same as what I already translated, but I think I have some more context to translate it differently:

499 This unfortunately is not really fixable. I'd have to convert the arrow tile into a sprite, and that's just more work than I really want to bother with. The tile is actually printed, but it's hidden by an HDMA effect drawing over it as part of the window's display routine.
500 Forgot "Strange dance" for the final step.
1003 Masaki episode 12, not episode 11.
1004 Save state and screenshot directly before the single word text box appears.
1005 Save state where this seems to happen 100% of the time.
1006 Same thing happens when transferring a pilot in a weaker unit.
1007 Attached incorrect save state. This is the correct one for this ticket.
1008 Changed to "Sho: Could I borrow that? She'll be more likely to believe I've come to save her if I show it to her."
1009 Resolving this for now; feel free to note any other robots this could change for.
1010 I don't think this is something that can be helped without making the font routine faster, unfortunately. Consequence of the hack.
1011 009 - "with" should be capitalized. Ep. 15
1012 This happens in a few text boxes during this scene.
