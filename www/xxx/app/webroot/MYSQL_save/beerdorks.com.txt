2 Chips and Beer, Together At Last Taking some whack-job's beer-and-potato fusion for a drunken test drive. Beer and potato chips may go together, but you rarely see even the drunkest of drunkards dipping his chips in his beer.<br /><br />Still, I suspect that is how Beer Chips were born. Some wag out in Portland, Ore., decided that beer and chips should be slammed together at high sppeds to create Beer Chips. They are, as the bag helpfully points out, potato chips made with beer. <br /><br />Along with the beer is lots of sweet stuff: sugar, honey, and cane syrup are all listed as ingredients on the bag.  There is also beer, but that comes below sugar. (The government's rule on food labeling is that ingredients must be listed descending order based on weight. Thus, potatoes come first here, then oil, then sugar, then beer.)<br /><br />The bag is helpful in other ways too, such as telling you how to eat the Beer Chips (1. open mouth, 2. insert beer chips, 3. swallow (don't forget to chew), 4. repeat.). It also informs you that "Beer Chips won't make you drunk, but they might make you more interesting." <br /><br />So, you  may ask, why am I talking so much about the bag?<br /><br />Because what's in it is not something you want to eat while drinking your beer. It's not that they were terrible, it is just that they were too sweet to be a bar snack. They certainly didn't get me drunk, and only made me more mildly interesting to the people I offered them to, since who wouldn't want free chips? But over all, my recommendation is to stick to regular chips with your beer. <br /><br />Besides, you don't really want to emulate the guy who has been drinking so long he's dunking his chips in his beer. 4 0 3 2006-05-06 1 1 1 17
3 Eternal Oktober A rundown of some of the Midwest's best-known Oktoberfest beers. Ah, autumn: football, deer hunting, crisp mornings and cool nights. And beer, of course. Because autumn plays host to what very well could be the largest party on Earth: Oktoberfest. And if you can't appreciate a good Oktoberfestbier along with a German sausage, aka <a href="http://www.johnsonville.com/" target="_blank">br&auml;t</a>, well, then, you just aren't a Beer Dork after all.<br /><br />In Germany the style known here as Oktoberfest is often called <i>M&auml;rzen</i> for March, because before the advent of refrigeration these beers were usually thrown together in late spring, the last batch before summer's heat prevented brewing. (Apparently March is late spring in Germany, unlike here in the Midwest where late spring is, oh, June.) Because this batch of suds had to last through the summer for consumption around harvest time, M&auml;rzens were made with a higher gravity than most beers, resulting in, among other things, a higher alcoholic kick. Necessity is, in this case, the mother of drunkness.<br /><br />This went on, of course, for hundreds of years. Then in 1810 a certain German prince by the name of Ludwig came along and things, as they say, would never be the same. See, this dude's mug should be in the dictionary next to the word <a href="http://m-w.com/dictionary/shindig" target="_blank">shindig</a>. He threw a party for his wedding in the fall of that year, and it was so kick-ass that the entire world now celebrates it annually as&#8212;you guessed it&#8212;Oktoberfest. Party <i>frickin' hard</i>.<br /><br />Style-wise the M&auml;rzen started off as a stepping stone from the traditional dark ales toward the lighter lagers such as the classic Pilsner (which eventually mutated into the abomination most ill-educated Americans think of when they hear the word "beer"). Being, basically, Vienna-style lagers, M&auml;rzens tended to be lighter in body and maltier than their old ale cousins, but still a long ways off from the golden-hued Pilsners or Dortmunders that would come to revolutionize the beer world. But time has a way of eroding tradition. Over the decades the German M&auml;rzen has lost much of its color and body, illustrated by the world-famous Hofbrau's Oktoberfest, which is virtually indistinguishable from their flagship light lager.<br /><br />Leave it up to the American craft brewers, as usual, to come to the rescue. The style has undergone a renaissance here in America, especially in the German heritage-heavy Midwest, where craft brewers have taken the style back to its roots, producing the dark, malty, toasty brews that Ludwig and his fellow revelers guzzled down in 1810 during that party for the ages. So without further ado, let's do a quick rundown of some of the better known Midwest Oktoberfestbiers.<br /><br /><b>Leave It Be</b><br /><a href="http://www.bellsbeer.com/" target="_blank">Bell's</a><br />I was absolutely shocked by how light and lagery Bell's entry was this year. More akin to today's M&auml;rzens, with a thin maltiness and watery aftertaste. I'd suggest leaving this on the shelf if you happen across it, something I'd never thought I'd say about a beer coming from this excellent brewery.<br /><br /><b>Good &#8230; But Not Great</b><br /><a href="http://www.gooseisland.com/" target="_blank">Goose Island</a>, <a href="http://www.leinie.com/" target="_blank">Leinenkugels</a>, <a href="http://www.summitbrewing.com/" target="_blank">Summit</a><br />The Goose displayed some nice maltiness, but only a hint of that toasty, almost porter-like backwash that, in this Beer Dork's opinion, defines the style. Leinenkugels just a hair less so in both departments, and a lot less body. The Summit entry was another bit of a shocker, coming in even more flat than the Leinies.<br /><br /><b>Doing Ludwig Proud</b><br /><a href="http://www.sprecherbrewery.com/" target="_blank">Sprecher</a>, <a href="http://www.capital-brewery.com/" target="_blank">Capital</a>, <a href="http://www.newglarusbrewing.com/" target="_blank">New Glarus</a><br />Capital's entry had always been the epitome for me of the Oktoberfest style: loads of maltiness offset by a full bodied toastiness, damn near bordering on coffee-like. Sprecher's entry came very close as well, but a slightly hoppy profile (rare in Sprecher's stuff) keeps it firmly behind Capital. And then there is the New Glarus Staghorn, an undisputed masterpiece in the Oktoberfest genre, its malt-body balance eclipsing even Capital's entry. You can't get it outside of Wisconsin, but it makes a roadtrip to the state worth it by itself.<br /><br />That's it, folks. Stay tuned for updates as more Midwest Oktoberfests roll out. I've got <a href="http://www.tyranena.com/" target="_blank">Tyranena</a>'s Oktoberfest chilling in the fridge waiting for a taste-off, and I'll be keeping my eyes peeled for others on the liquor store shelf. So if you know of any tasty seasonal brews you think are deserving, make like a beer and <a href="mailto:eddie@beerdorks.com">give me a buzz</a>. 1 0 3 2006-09-18 1 1 1 10
4 Drink Historical A brief but enlightening beer tour of history-rich Philadelphia. Because beer has played such a massive part in nearly every culture&rsquo;s history, it&rsquo;s small wonder that a lot of Beer Dorks are history buffs. And when you&rsquo;re talking history&#8212;especially American history&#8212;it doesn&rsquo;t get too much more historical than Philadelphia. Not too long ago I was able to take a long weekend to explore this great city, a city where our founding fathers laid the groundwork for the most powerful system of government the world has ever seen. And&#8212;almost as importantly&#8212;where they brewed and drank some damn fine beer.<br /><br /><img src="/tmp_imx/IMG_2975.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="267" border="0" class="portrait" />My first stop was the <a href="http://www.independencebrewpub.com/" target="_blank">Independence Brewpub</a>, and like just about every other object in Philly, its sole marketing push is a reference to the Founding Fathers, in this instance a logo sporting a jovial Ben Franklin hoisting a pint. Sadly this is the only revolutionary thing about the place. With the cliched polished oak interior, overpriced bar food and a rote beer list, it&rsquo;s a little too polished and sanitized so as to not scare off the suburbanite business slobs wandering over from the convention center looking to &ldquo;absorb a little local color.&rdquo; In other words: boring as shit. Hell, even a chain like <a href="http://www.rockbottom.com/" target="_blank">Rock Bottom</a> can manage to squeeze out a seasonal. Their IPA was especially forgettable.<br /><br />Which is why I headed a few blocks over to <a href="http://www.fergies.com/" target="_blank">Fergies</a> next, hoping to get that bad experience out of my head. And mouth. The atmosphere was standard half-Irish, half-dive, and the beer list was decent. Aside from the mandatory Harp, Bass and Guiness, I saw a few Belgian bottles behind the bar, a couple of varieties of <a href="http://www.victorybeer.com/" target="_blank">Victory</a>&rsquo;s excellent stuff, even a <a href="http://www.rogue.com/" target="_blank">Rogue</a> Dead Guy. But, more importantly, this is where I got my first sweet sip of a beer from a local brewery called <a href="http://www.yardsbrewing.com/" target="_blank">Yards</a>.<br /><br />I saw a tap handle for their Philadelphia Pale Ale and immediately ordered up a pint. Very nice. Massive hop aroma and big-time bitter finish. It made me completely forget about the vast boredom of the Independence Brewpub. Good thing I brought my camera.<br /><br />A gaggle of bachelorette floozies looking for light beer drove me out and over to <a href="http://www.phillytown.com/moriartys.htm" target="_blank">Moriarty</a>&rsquo;s, scarcely two blocks away. A long, narrow room, with check-clothed covered tables on the left and a bar that seemed to stretch into infinity on the right. The place sported a smaller but still passable beer list. And it was here I got my first taste from <a href="http://www.yuengling.com/" target="_blank">Yuengling</a>, America&rsquo;s oldest brewery. I tried their lager. For a &ldquo;premium beer&rdquo; it wasn&rsquo;t half bad. Definitely not high on my list, but I&rsquo;d drink it in a pinch. Later I was able to try the beer that put them on the map 170-odd years ago, the Yuengling Porter. Much better&nbsp;&#8230;but not as good as it gets, as you&rsquo;ll see if you read on.<br /><br />The next day I got up at the crack of noon, checked out some of Philly&rsquo;s non-beer-centric historical sites, and worked up a mighty thirst. By four o&rsquo;clock I was ready for a cold one. Being in the Historical District (probably should be called the More Historical District), I headed over to <a href="http://www.citytavern.com/" target="_blank">City Tavern</a>.<br /><br /><img src="/tmp_imx/IMG_3028.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="266" border="0" class="landscape" /><br />This bar/restaurant is a replica of a colonial-era public house, complete with colonial-garbed bar and waitstaff. The tavern area was a seriously authentic-looking cramped room with a handful of notched wooden booths and slat tables. The whole ambience smacked of being a little too touristy to me, but twas the beer that drew me in. City Tavern boasts itself as the exclusive purveyor of beers brewed from the original recipes of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin. All three are contract-brewed by the aforementioned Yards, and all three were outstanding. Jefferson&rsquo;s ale was a medium-bodied, very lightly hopped amber number, and Poor Richard&rsquo;s was almost like a dark herbal ale, with notes of spices and spruce tips. But Washington&rsquo;s porter was the real standout: full-bodied, a touch of hops, and a toasty, mocha-like finish. Yum. Probably the best beer I had all weekend. Old George was said to really like his porter, and it showed in this fantastic beer.<br /><br />By then I was ready for some football, so I hoofed it over to <a href="http://www.buffalobilliards.com/philadelphia/" target="_blank">Buffalo Billards</a>. Standard sports bar stuff: tons of big-screen TVs, rent-by-the-hour pool tables, dart boards. The beer list was passable, and I tried a watery Oktoberfest from <a href="http://www.flyingfish.com/" target="_blank">Flying Fish</a>, then an unspectacular golden ale from <a href="http://www.slyfoxbeer.com/" target="_blank">Sly Fox</a> before switching to a tried-and-true Sierra Nevada Oktoberfest.<br /><br />Once I had my football fix I made my way to the <a href="http://www.ploughstars.com/" target="_blank">Plough and Stars</a>, yet another &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; Irish pub. This one oozed hipness as well: soaring ceilings decorated with chic lighting, an Irish folk band plinking away on little stools in the corner, a metrosexual maitre&rsquo;d posing at the host station, and black-clad blonde waitresses bouncing off the walls like over-endowed ping pong balls. If you took that as a recommendation, you&rsquo;re probably at the wrong web site. The beer was standard-issue Irish pub blah, broken up by a Yards and a Sam Adams&nbsp;&#8230; which they were out of. The service just plain sucked. No apologies for being out of nearly half their taps, and when I did finally find a beer I wanted it took forever for them to bring it out. Again, not a simple &ldquo;Thanks for waiting&rdquo; or anything. Pointless.<br /><br />Which was a real shame, because there are still tons of great bars in Philly that I didn&rsquo;t hit&#8212;Eulogy, Monk&rsquo;s Cafe, Nodding Head, just to name three. Hopefully I can give them all a visit on another trip, because I fully intend to go back someday. A wise man once said those who don&rsquo;t learn their history are doomed to repeat it, but General Washington&rsquo;s porter is definitely something <i>worth</i> repeating. And repeating. And repeating. And repeating&nbsp;&#8230; 1 0 1 2006-10-06 1 1 1 14
5 Chutzpah or Beer? Checking out a Kosher microbrew. Oy. You?ve survived another year of High Holy Days with Aunt Esther pinching your cheek and threatening to take you to the yenta because it?s about time you settled down with a nice Jewish girl. You could really use a cold one, but you?ve resolved to keep kosher and you never know what unclean things are lurking in your average craft beer.<br /><br />Lucky for you, <a href="http://www.shmaltz.com" target="_blank">Shmaltz Brewing Company</a> has come through with just what a kosher-keeping Jew like yourself needs to take the edge off: a line of microbrewed ales called HE?BREW that are kosher certified and rabbi approved. But how does it stack up against the Gentile product?<br /><br />I took HE?BREW?s two main offerings, Genesis Brown Ale and Messiah Bold, to some Chosen Ones (Gil, Greg, and Joanne) to see if kosher beer lived up to its promise. The packaging showed promise as to what was inside, including a shout-out to Passover with each beer answering the question, ?Why is this beer different from all other beers??<br /><br />Shmaltz describes the Genesis Ale as a ?smooth and distinctive light brown ale.? My crew and I found it to be quite tasty. It?s got a nice nutty-brown appearance, has a flavor similar to a Sam Adams. No hoppy aftertaste makes it go down smooth. Gil said he also really enjoyed drinking it. Greg thought it was good. Joanne thought it went down really easy with a full flavor that didn?t have a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Our opinions changed with the opening of the Messiah Bold, HE?BREW?s dark brown ale. Shmaltz claims ?it?s the beer you?ve been waiting for,? but most of our group came to the conclusion that the messiah of beers had not yet come. Although a nice dark color, I found it to be quite watery, and Gil agreed that it was weak and didn?t have as a rich of a taste as was promised. In fact, he said, ?This is a waste of a beer.? Joanne said the Genesis was 100% better than the Messiah. Greg said that although he thought it was good, he thought they should just make it 15% alcohol and forget about the taste. I guess if you?re going to create the messiah of beers, you need to go big or go home.<br /><br />Overall, HE?BREW changes your mind about the possibility of kosher microbrew. They?ve done a good job with perfecting a light brown ale in the Genesis, but their dark ale Messiah needs a little help. So, my kosher friends, when you need to kick back and relax, grab a refreshing Genesis Ale and drink to life. L?Chaim! 3 0 1 2006-10-11 1 1 1 29
1 Enemies Of Homogeneity The Beer Dorks&rsquo; whack-job manifesto. Hi. My name is Eddie Glick. I want to talk to you about beer and why you should drink locally or, lacking that, regionally brewed beer instead of the stuff brewed by some faceless corporation a million miles away. Don't get me wrong, I love good beer, no matter who is producing it. But we as Beer Dorks know&#8212;or <i>should</i> know&#8212;that beer is much more than fermented sugar water in a glass. Beer is about history. It&rsquo;s about culture. It&rsquo;s about community. Add all those things up, and you have the word <i>heritage</i>.<br /><br />Nearly every country on Earth has some form of beer heritage, from the rich brewing legacies of Germany and Belgium to the countries in Africa and Asia and South America. As Americans, our beer heritage was robbed from us. Initially by Prohibition, followed up by Word War II, and&#8212;what may have been the most destructive force of all&#8212;the homogenization of the American culture during the latter half of the 20th century.<br /><br />Prior to World War II, America was still made of basically local cultures constrained by geography. The rise of radio, television, movies, automobiles and the interstate system allowed people to see, hear and experience the countless unique cultures and sites across the country. But at the same time Americans just plain weren&rsquo;t <i>ready</i> to handle all this&nbsp;&#8230; this <i>new</i>. They wanted some familiarity when they traveled in their Chevies and Fords across country. Enter the chains. Restaurants, gas stations and motels were the first, but what has followed is mind-numbing, from Starbucks to Walmart to Home Depot. American beer saw the same thing happen. The consolidation of the brewing industry didn&rsquo;t happen within its own isolated sphere. Customers weren&rsquo;t demanding different, bolder beers only to have their pleas fall on deaf ears. The majority of Americans in the 1950s and &rsquo;60s plain didn&rsquo;t <i>want</i> anything but tasteless sugar water. They wanted their Budweiser and Marlboros and Beatles and I Love Lucy and McDonalds. They wanted <i>what everyone else</i> wanted. An entire generation came of age inundated by this ant farm mentality. These global corporations were a part of their life. Their culture. Their <i>heritage</i>. The homogenization of America was all but complete.<br /><br />But&#8212;it&rsquo;s taken damn near 40 years&#8212;the worm is starting to turn. Cable television, satellite TV and radio, and the Internet are allowing people to <i>discover</i> what they like, instead of being cajoled, tricked or even forced into buying, watching, listening to the latest new creation from corporate America. And the same thing is happening with our palates. Americans more and more are opting to buy from their local gourmet shop rather than the chain grocery store, eat at the mom-and-pop German or Italian or Mexican place around the corner instead of going to McDonalds and, most importanly, sip a pint of handcrafted beer at the local brewpub rather than buy a Bud Light.<br /><br />But of course the chains aren&rsquo;t going to go down without a fight. So big beer gives itself a brain transplant and focuses on making a product that tastes like, well, beer instead of churning out semi-amusing TV ads. And I&rsquo;m not saying don&rsquo;t drink it. What I am saying is, <i>taste being equal</i>, drink that craft brew instead. As the saying goes, <i>drink local</i>. Capitalism is a form of democracy, and your money is your vote. So vote small-batch, handcrafted beer, brewed by people who care about, even know, their customers. Because when you buy big beer, a large chunk of that money disappears from your neighborhood. And big beer doesn&rsquo;t care about craft beer or, actually, beer in general. They care about money. And homogenization is cheap. If it weren&rsquo;t they wouldn&rsquo;t be doing it.<br /><br />So when you drink your local craft brew, you&rsquo;re getting more than just a great beer. You&rsquo;re investing in your neighborhood, your community, your local culture. Meshed together, these hundreds of thousands of local cultures across America are creating a new beer heritage, one that, right now, is producing the best, most innovative beers in the world. And don&rsquo;t you for a damn second think of taking that heritage for granted. 1 0 3 2006-10-18 1 1 1 17
6 One Belluva Problem Two (well, three, actually) sides to the mess that led to Bell's Brewing pulling out of the Illinois market. Illinois has run out of Bell&rsquo;s beer, and there is no more coming.<br /><br />Larry Bell, the owner of Bell&rsquo;s Brewery, in Galesburg, Mich., said it&rsquo;s not personal and he likes Chicago and Illinois. The reason he is now shipping his beer to Iowa and Virginia instead is that he has had a falling out with his distributor, National Wine and Spirits, Inc., which is headquartered in Indianapolis.<br /><br />&ldquo;It is a shame that we&rsquo;re not going to do business in Illinois, but we&rsquo;re not going to be able to come to an agreement down there right now,&rdquo; Bell said.<br /><br /><i>(Note to Illinois Bell&rsquo;s drinkers: Keep those shipments to Iowa in mind as you fight the rising panic while reading this article.)</i><br /><br />Bell said that NWS had subcontracted distribution of Bell&rsquo;s to a company called Glazer Wholesale Distributors, of Dallas, Texas. In July, NWS announced that it wanted to buy out Glazer&rsquo;s contract and get out of the beer distribution business.<br /><br />Because NWS was going to focus only on wine and spirits, this meant it would sell the rights to distribute Bell&rsquo;s beer.<br /><br />&ldquo;The distribution rights were being sold to a company we did not want to do business with. Our choice was to be sold, get sued, or leave,&rdquo; Bell said.<br /><br />Rather than fight a costly court battle, Bell&rsquo;s decided to leave, Bell said.<br /><br />Bell did not name the company his rights would be sold to, and NWS did not respond to requests for comment.<br /><br />The distribution of alcoholic beverages is regulated by both federal and state laws that set up a three-tier system. Brewers are at tier I and not allowed to sell directly to retail outlets, which are tier III. That is where tier II, the distributors, come in. Illinois law prevents a brewer from changing distributors without some kind of cause. So, once a distributor owns the rights to a particular brand, it is the only one that can distribute that beer until it sells the rights or there is some kind of cause that would allow the brewer to switch.<br /><br />The law is what is preventing Bell&rsquo;s Brewery from just delivering its beer to bars and stores itself.<br /><br />But, Bill Olson, an executive vice president with the Associated Beer Distributors of Illinois, said that NWS&rsquo; plans to sell the rights to Bell&rsquo;s would be sufficient cause for Bell to look for another distributor that would be to his liking.<br /><br />&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s already got an agreement with a distributor, he can cancel that for-cause, and I think he has a for-cause action here,&rdquo; Olsen said.<br /><br />Olsen said that the reason Illinois law prevents brewers from arbitrarily switching distributors is that the distributors put a lot of money into marketing the beer on behalf of the brand by selling to retailers, holding tasting events, and doing &ldquo;whatever we need to do to create an interest in that product.&rdquo; The reason they do this is that by helping the beer sell, the distributor makes more money distributing it.<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re picking up an obligation to spend money when we say we are going to be their distributors,&rdquo; Olsen said. He said the law was there to make sure that the distributors are fairly compensated for the work they put into selling a beer.<br /><br />Olsen said he thinks that Bell should hire a lawyer to look into the law and see what his options are in Illinois rather than giving up on the market.<br /><br />Bell said that is not something he wants to do. So, for the time being, there will be no Bell&rsquo;s beer in Illinois.<br /><br />So, what is an Illinois Bell&rsquo;s lover to do in the meantime?<br /><br />Well, true Beer Dorks know how to get their favorite brew. After doing some checking, it appears that some of the beer that was coming to Illinois is now going over to Iowa. One of the lucky recipients is a place called <a href="http://www.johnsgrocery.com" target="_blank">John&rsquo;s Grocery</a> in Iowa City, Iowa. John&rsquo;s will ship any beer it stocks, including Bell&rsquo;s, to Illinois and several other states. (Readers outside of Illinois will need to call for availability. Variations in state laws prevent John&rsquo;s from shipping everywhere.) The guy who took my order at the store said John&rsquo;s has been trying to get Bell&rsquo;s to come there for a long time, but never had any luck. No luck, that is, until Bell&rsquo;s left Illinois.<br /><br />Well, within a week I had a six-pack of Bell&rsquo;s Oberon and a six-pack of Bell&rsquo;s porter on my kitchen table. You can only browse the web site and must place your order by phone. Now, the cost of shipping two six-packs to Chicago was about $11. But desperate times call for desperate measures. 4 0 5 2006-11-06 1 1 1 61
7 The Importance Of Style In a perfect world, we wouldn't need beer styles. In a perfect world, someone would have invented the poopless dog, too. So I recently embarked on a road trip to Three Floyds Brewing Co. in Munster, Indiana to confront those abnormal brewers about their Alpha King Pale Ale. I needed to ask them where the Hell they got off calling that thing a pale ale. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love the Alpha King, like any true hophead would. But calling that thing a pale ale is like calling&nbsp;&#8230; crap, I can&rsquo;t think of a good metaphor. If you can, <a href="mailto:eddie@beerdorks.com">send it to me</a>. Anyway, the damn thing is hoppier than all get out.<br /><br />OK, admittedly, pale ales are supposed to have a relatively assertive hop profile. The key phrase here being &ldquo;relatively assertive.&rdquo; Not &ldquo;neck-wrecking.&rdquo; The Alpha King is hoppier than most IPAs, and even a few doubles out there. I even had a cask-conditioned Alpha King that was the only beer I&rsquo;ve ever thought was <i>too</i> hoppy&#8212;which is a tough one to pull off. Needless to say, the Alpha King has <a href="http://www.biologydaily.com/biology/International_Bitterness_Units_scale" target="_blank">earned its name</a> in spades.<br /><br /><img src="/tmp_imx/IMG_2544.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="339" border="0" class="landscape" />
So I cruised down to Munster and located the Three Floyds headquarters, a surprisingly small brewery in a quiet, relatively new industrial park. I bellied up to the bar in their very nice little brewpub, fortified myself with several fine Three Floyds brews, then braced the heavily tattooed, shaven-head bartender/brewer on the job that day, a dude named Barnaby.<br /><br />&ldquo;Where do you get off calling the Alpha King a pale ale, anyway?&rdquo; I growled at him.<br /><br />Without even a <i>sliver</i> of hesitation, he says, &ldquo;Show me the rules! Show&nbsp;&#8230; me&nbsp;&#8230; the&nbsp;&#8230; rules.&rdquo;<br /><br />So what the Hell do you say to that, especially if the speaker is tattooed from here to Saturday, shaves his head, and has a hand in brewing some of the most kick-ass beer in the Midwest?<br /><br />You stick up for the beer philistines (who I would normally feed the fire with, if given a choice), that&rsquo;s what you do. So I tell him I was just thinking about the poor, non-Beer-Dork bastard who wanders into the local pub and asks for Heineken or Bud Light or some other form of rotten goat piss and, upon finding his favorite brand of tasteless swill has been drunk up by a gang of gutless frat boys, squints bewilderedly at the tap handles, sees the term &ldquo;pale ale&rdquo; beneath the Alpha King moniker and thinks, &ldquo;Why, all the beers I like are pale, therefore I&rsquo;m bound to like this&nbsp;&#8230; &lsquo;Alpha King!&rsquo;&rdquo; And then that poor son of a bitch proceeds to burn half his face off on that hop monstrosity.<br /><br /><img src="/tmp_imx/IMG_2551.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="386" border="0" class="portrait" />Barnaby countered with the argument that a drinking establishment&rsquo;s friendly barkeep or server should keep ignorant patrons informed of what they are about to do to their bodies. Which is a valid argument. In a perfect world. In a perfect world, polar bears play with little fuzzy bunnies instead of eating them alive while drinking Coca-Cola and communism works. Because although most bartenders are well-informed about what they&rsquo;re pouring, I&rsquo;ve seen a few ignorami servers out their actually <i>recommend</i> the Alpha King to some unsuspecting dumb schmuck. Hey, maybe they were just sadists.<br /><br />So who gives a rat&rsquo;s ass, you might rhetorically ask. Well, <i>you</i> should, if you&rsquo;re a Beer Dork, or even a wanna-be Beer Dork. Because now the poor sap who&rsquo;s walking around with half his tongue missing will think all craft brews are shocking monsters just waiting to eat their children, and he&rsquo;ll go back to drinking Amstel Light, wrongly thinking for the rest of his life that <i>that</i> abomination was as good as it gets.<br /><br />Which brings me, extremely roundaboutly, to my point. The correct labeling of a beer&rsquo;s style is important for this simple reason: so that consumers know what they&rsquo;re getting. You can&rsquo;t brew up a saison and call it a Russian imperial stout just for shits and giggles. Because somewhere down the line someone much bigger than you who bought that saison thinking he was getting an imperial stout is going to track you down and plant the empty bottle in your colon. In a perfect world, at least. Because I&rsquo;m a firm believer in what comes around goes around.<br /><br />Now, I&rsquo;m not saying we need to develop some kind of <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM" target="_blank">Hammurabi&rsquo;s Code</a> for beer styles or anything like that. In fact, the only real &ldquo;law&rdquo; telling us what beer is supposed to be is the famous <a href="http://www.brewery.org/library/ReinHeit.html" target="_blank">Reinheitsgebot</a>, or German Beer Purity Law, which the modern American craft brewer took two glances at then (thankfully) threw out the window.<br /><br />(Although purists and, especially, Germans like to sniff haughtily and explain that their beer is the best in the world because of the purity law, it was actually enacted by the German monarchy not out of any benevolent desire for quality, but in order to tax the living shit out of barley, yeast, hops and water.)<br /><br />So, no, we don&rsquo;t need any hard and fast rules. And I&rsquo;m all for exploration and innovation, <i>especially</i> when it comes to beer. What I&rsquo;m saying is, always keep style in mind when you&rsquo;re evaluating, rating, ranking, judging, or just plain ol&rsquo; drinking a beer. Because if we Beer Dorks don&rsquo;t keep those rascally craft brewers in line, who is? 1 0 1 2006-11-16 1 1 1 19
8 Know Thy Beer Thinking of ordering up a pint of that new craft brew your local pub just got in? Know before you buy&#8212;you may just be getting a repackaged macro. So I was in a bar (shocker!) recently with a few acquaintances (yes, Eddie Glick has a couple floating around here and there), and the only even remotely drinkable beer that this sub-average joint offered was a Blue Moon. The aforementioned acquaintances were happily drinking the macro swill the place offered and, so as not to appear rude, I ordered a Blue Moon.<br /><br />Now, me being a Beer Dork, I knew before I ordered that Blue Moon is brewed and distributed by Coors, or, to be more accurate, Molson Coors Brewing Co., which Coors became after merging with Canada&rsquo;s largest brewer. The problem is the vast majority of beer drinkers don&rsquo;t know that. They see &ldquo;Belgian White&rdquo; on the bottle or tap and think it&rsquo;s either from Belgium or it&rsquo;s a craft brew. A few of your dimmer bar patrons may see it served with an orange slice jammed onto the lip of the pint glass and think, &ldquo;Ooh! An orange slice! How&nbsp;&#8230; exotic!&rdquo; and decide to order one simply because of that.<br /><br />(Eddie&rsquo;s policy on fruit in your beer: if the brewer wants fruit in the beer, the brewer should brew that beer with fruit. So, hold the lemon wedge, please.)<br /><br />Coors has been pulling this little stunt for about ten years. They do everything they can think of to pretend that Blue Moon has nothing to do with giant, faceless brewing. They shun big-budget advertising, let distributors who specialize in selling craft brews and small brands talk it up to retailers, and specifically aim at markets that will accept it while not asking too many questions (i.e., people who like to think of themselves as &ldquo;trendy&rdquo; and try to perpetuate this by hanging out in &ldquo;trendy&rdquo; bars and clubs).<br /><br />And this strategy has worked quite well for Coors. Estimates for sales of Blue Moon in the month of November 2006 are up to 500,000 barrels&#8212;far, far more than all but the very largest craft breweries in the country.<br /><br />I shouldn&rsquo;t sound so combative about this, though, since Blue Moon is, to me, a perfectly drinkable beer, especially during those dusty Midwest summers. I would much rather drink something with a little more verve and vigor, but it&rsquo;ll do in a pinch when no other viable choices are available. I think we&rsquo;ve all been stuck in that situation where we let our acquaintances make the beer-drinking decisions for us, with sometimes disastrous results. Talk about hating yourself the next morning&nbsp;&#8230;<br /><br />All this would be fine and good, but as the craft brewing industry begins to gain ground on the macro brewers, the other big boys look at Coors&rsquo; successful strategy and start to hatch nefarious plans of their own&#8212;such as forming little satellite companies like Crooked Creek Brewing Co. and Green Valley Brewing Co. and attaching beers like Stone Mill Pale Ale and Wild Hop Lager to them, respectively. Surprise! Both are owned and operated by Anheuser-Busch. Or they&rsquo;ll invest heavily in an existing craft brewer, like Portland, Oregon&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.allaboutbeer.com/news/states/97widmer.html" target="_blank">Widmer</a> or Seattle&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2004/06/28/daily33.html" target="_blank">Redhook</a>, both of which are partially owned by Anheuser-Busch. To even further distance their name from a craft brewer&rsquo;s image, Anheuser-Busch invested in Goose Island by proxy: Widmer <a href="http://www.soave.com/news/bev_goose-island.htm" target="_blank">put up the money</a> to grab a 40 percent stake in the Chicago-based brewery. SAB Miller is a bit more blunt in their methods. They just buy craft brewing companies outright, like <a href="http://www.leinie.com/" target="_blank">Leinenkugel&rsquo;s</a> or Portland&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.henryweinhards.com/" target="_blank">Henry Weinhard&rsquo;s</a>.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ve already gone off on <a href="articles.php?article_id=1">my rant</a> about how big brewing can damage the rebirth of America&rsquo;s beer heritage and the importance of drinking local, so I won&rsquo;t repeat it here. What I will say is these companies are tricking us into buying their product. Even if they were putting out quality beers&#8212;and I have not had a chance to try either Stone Mill Pale Ale or Wild Hop Lager&#8212;the fact that they refuse to attach their names to it tells you flat out that they don&rsquo;t really care about the quality and taste of the beer. Here&rsquo;s a hint what they <i>do</i> care about: it looks like an S with a vertical bar driven through it. They see this craft beer thing as a flash in the pan, like the horrid &ldquo;malternatives&rdquo; from a couple years back and wine coolers before that. Once the fad fades, they say to themselves, we&rsquo;ll ditch those &ldquo;craft&rdquo; brews and return our focus to the stuff that resembles water more than beer. Ka-ching.<br /><br />Are craft brewers interested in money? Yes, they are. But the way they make their money isn&rsquo;t through advertising an image for those who drink their beer or tricking customers into buying their product. They make their money by offering quality beer. If their product is crap, their company will very likely go down the toilet. Because Beer Dorks care about quality first and everything else a distant second. So if those big breweries want to make a good beer, MAKE A GOOD BEER! Go ahead, slap your own name on it, say &ldquo;Proudly brewed by Miller Brewing Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin.&rdquo; If it&rsquo;s good&#8212;and no local brew of equal quality or better is readily available&#8212;I&rsquo;ll drink it.<br /><br />And, for the record, good old Anheuser-Busch gave this tactic a shot by selling their Beach Bum Blonde Ale. I tried it with an open mind. Seriously, Eddie Glick can do that once in a while. And guess what? It tasted like semi-fermented toilet water. These companies are so driven by marketing and brand recognition that they can&rsquo;t bring themselves to produce anything other than homogeneous swill and still put their names on it. It would make the masses&#8212;gleep!&#8212;think! Katy bar the door.<br /><br />Therefore, before ordering up that intriguing but heretofore unknown brew, <b>know thy beer</b>. Stay informed by sticking with the Beer Dorks and reading our <a href="reviews.php">reviews</a> and <a href="articles.php">articles</a>. Or poke around at <a href="http://ratebeer.com/" target="_blank">Rate Beer</a> or <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/" target="_blank">Beer Advocate</a>. Find out where your beer is coming from before you put it in your body. Because an informed customer is a happy customer. And getting tricked into drinking ditch water from St. Louis can really ruin one&rsquo;s day. 1 0 1 2006-12-02 1 1 1 17
9 The Beer Guy Always Rings Twice John&#8217;s Grocery is willing to ship great craft brews to just about anywhere in America, as long as you call them up and talk beer with them first. A mom-and-pop grocery store in Iowa wants to make sure that beer lovers everywhere can get great craft brews from anywhere.<br /><br />John&#8217;s Grocery, in Iowa City, has 2,578 different beers in its coolers, and they are willing to ship them just about anywhere in the United States except Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, and Utah. Doug Alberhasky, whose title is the Beer Guy, said the store will ship to anyone who actually calls them and orders a good beer. <br /><br />&#8220;We&#8217;re only shipping out good stuff to beer lovers across the country who are looking for their favorite beers,&#8221; Alberhasky said. <br /><br />Because the company specializes in craft brews, being in Iowa is also an advantage, because it is smack dab in the middle of the country. So, it is easy to ship beer anywhere in the United States.<br /><br /><div class="imgBoxPortrait"><img src="/imx/9_1.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="380" border="0" /><div class="caption">Doug &#8220;The Beer Guy&#8221; Alberhasky (far right) and family in front of John&rsquo;s Grocery.</div></div>&#8220;We&#8217;re kind of strategically placed in the Midwest so we can offer things not only from the Midwest but from the coasts as well,&#8221; he said.<br /><br />Although the building John&#8217;s is in has been standing since 1848, last year the company had to build a 44-foot-long walk-in cooler to properly take care of its stock.  Alberhasky said he wishes he had built one twice that size because already he is running out of room for all the beer he has.<br /><br />You can view their selection online at <a href="http://johnsgrocery.com" target="_blank">johnsgrocery.com</a>. Loyal readers will remember that this site was offered as a solution for Illinois residents who want to get some Bell&#8217;s beer since <a href="articles.php?article_id=6">Bell&#8217;s stopped shipping</a> to Illinois in October. John&#8217;s was very accommodating about sending me a six-pack of Bell&#8217;s Oberon and Bell&#8217;s Porter. Although I did grouse a little about the shipping price, Alberhasky has suggestions on controlling costs.<br /><br />He said it is most cost effective to order at least a case at a time. Also, because John&#8217;s uses UPS to ship its beer (it is illegal to send alcohol through the U.S. Post Office), it is cheaper to send the beer to a business address, he said.  If the order gets to be over 200 pounds, which is about six cases, John&#8217;s will offer a slight discount.<br /><br />The company got into Internet sales about nine years ago, and at first was selling only beer glasses. It has been selling beer for about five years, and that business was made easier once the Supreme Court ruled in May 2005 that interstate shipments of wine could not be prohibited. <br /><br />&#8220;I contend there is not any difference between a grape and a grain,&#8221; Alberhasky said. <br /><br /><div class="imgBoxPortrait"><img src="/imx/9_2.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="321" border="0" /><div class="caption">The new beer room at John&rsquo;s Grocery.</div></div>He said requiring customers to call is how he makes sure that he is not shipping beer to anyone under 21. He said he has gotten e-mails about ordering beer from people and was sure they were kids. He said that over the phone he can tell when he is talking as one beer lover to another and so he knows he is shipping to adults of legal age. <br /><br />&#8220;We actually talk to the customer directly&#8212;we&#8217;re not going to be getting into a situation where we&#8217;re going to be shipping a 13-year-old kid a six-pack of Bud Light,&#8221; he said. <br /><br />John&#8217;s Grocery is not the only company selling beer online. <a href="http://beergeek.biz" target="_blank">Beergeek.com</a>, an Illinois-based company, will ship to most states. It sells through a Yahoo store and requires that the buyer show identification to the Fed-Ex delivery driver. <br /><br />When I searched for other online beer sellers, most of the results focused on home brewing supplies. <br /><br />Calling John&#8217;s highlights one thing that sets it apart&#8212;good customer service.<br /><br />&#8220;We give such good service, we&#8217;ll come over and help you drink it,&#8221; Alberhasky said. 4 0 3 2006-12-07 1 1 1 92
10 Midwest Brewery Power Rankings The Beer Dorks&rsquo; very first power rankings find Three Floyds on top by a hair. Welcome to the Beer Dorks&#8217; very first Power Rankings for Midwest craft brewers! I've debated with many a fellow Dork about what brewery was the best in the Midwest, and I thought I'd make my arguments public. I can&#8217;t guarantee how often rankings will be released, but I do welcome comments and, yes, criticism. So let me have it, fellow Beer Dorks. Tell me why I&#8217;m an idiot. Or, more likely, a genius. And be a dear and let me know if I missed any glaringly awesome breweries in Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, Michigan (the UP counts!), Indiana or Ohio. Now, on with the list!<br /><br />

<b>1. Three Floyds Brewing</b><br />
Munster, IN<br />
Riding hops to the top.<br /><br />

<b>2. Founders Brewing Co.</b><br />
Grand Rapids, MI<br />
Despite an embarassment of riches, just barely edged out by FFF.<br /><br />

<b>3. New Glarus Brewing Company</b><br />
New Glarus, WI<br />
Limited distribution keeps Dan Carey and company out of the number-one spot.<br /><br />

<b>4. Bell&rsquo;s Brewery, Inc.</b><br />
Galesburg, MI<br />
Fourth only by a hair. A very thin hair.<br /><br />

<b>5. Capital Brewery</b><br />
Middleton, WI<br />
Mystifies this Beer Dork why we don&#8217;t see their stuff everywhere.<br /><br />

<b>6. Great Lakes Brewing Co.</b><br />
Cleveland, OH<br />
Ohio&#8217;s best brewery coming on strong.<br /><br />

<b>7. Two Brothers Brewing Company</b><br />
Warrenville, IL<br />
Big, new beers show major promise.<br /><br />

<b>8. Goose Island Beer Co.</b><br />
Chicago, IL<br />
Hurt by association with the devil. By proxy.<br /><br />

<b>9. Sprecher Brewing Co.</b><br />
Glendale, WI<br />
More innovative beers needed.<br /><br />

<b>10. Summit Brewing Company</b><br />
St. Paul, MN<br />
Edges out a bevy of others.<br /><br />

<b>The Criteria</b><br />
<b>Innovation:</b> The American craft brewing movement was built upon innovation, and it&#8217;s that quality that is keeping the industry dynamic and alive. Possibly the most important criteria.<br /><br />

<b>Overall Quality:</b> Not just the number of good beers a brewer produces, but the consistency of the entire line up.<br /><br />

<b>Availability:</b> The only criteria not direcly tied to the brewers&#8217; art, but important nonetheless. You could brew the greatest beers on Earth, but what good would it do if no one had the chance to drink them?<br /><br />

<b>Monsterism:</b> Beer Dorks like big beers. You know what they like more than big beers? <i>Monstrously</i> big beers.<br /><br />

<b>Integrity and Attitude:</b> How does the brewer approach the business of beer-making? Is the beer always first? It should be. 1 0 6 2006-12-18 1 1 1 21
95 Beat The Devil It&rsquo;s a little-known but proven fact that the best defense against ghosts and goblins is Midwest craft beer. Halloween is yet another holiday that has officially joined the likes of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and New Year&rsquo;s Eve in the ranks of &ldquo;amateur night.&rdquo; Going out for a spooky brew on All Hallow&rsquo;s Eve means dealing with idiots drinking whatever gets them drunk fastest and inexplicably wearing beads.<br /><br />

But at least I get a bit of an ironic chuckle when I see costumed carousers mindlessly celebrating Halloween, since most of these shit beer-swilling, bead-wearing philistines don&rsquo;t realize that, like most modern holidays, Halloween&rsquo;s origins go all the way back to pagan times. It got its start as the Celtic festival Samhain (pronounced <i>sow-win</i>), which was, to them, New Year&rsquo;s Eve. It observed the end of the harvest season and the advent of the winter&mdash;a period of darkness that, in a way, represented death. They believed the barrier separating the living and the dead faded during this transformative day, allowing their shamans, the Druids, to communicate with their deceased ancestors in order to predict the future. It also meant the dead could come across to the world of the living, as well, which is never a good thing.<br /><br />

To protect themselves on Samhain, the Celts built huge bonfires to drive away the ghosts, and they dressed in costumes to disguise themselves from vengeful spirits. Unlike today, it was less a holiday than a somber observance. Families left offerings of food and drink (here&rsquo;s a hint as to what kind of drink it probably was: folks didn&rsquo;t drink water back then, the Celts did not cultivate grapes to make wine, and whiskey had not been invented yet) out on the table for their ancestors. When they returned from the bonfires, they found their offerings were gone, taken by the dead.<br /><br />

Looking at the customs we follow on October 31st&mdash;and despite the Christian church&rsquo;s efforts to wrap it in holy days&mdash;you could say no other modern holiday is more of a taproot to pagan rituals than Halloween. In fact, the tradition of children roaming from house to house begging for or demanding tribute has incredibly ancient roots, wherein the children directly represented cohorts of the dead.<br /><br />

While we can all agree that this is pretty damn creepy, you&rsquo;re probably wondering what exactly all this has to do with beer. First off, Samhain is, at its core, a harvest festival, and nothing is more important to the making of beer than a good harvest. With a bountiful reaping of good barley, more and better tasting beer could be made. And a bumper crop of herbs and vegetables meant more options were available to spice and preserve that beer&mdash;remember, hops weren&rsquo;t widely used in beer until at least midway through the first millennium A.D.<br /><br />

But herbs and veggies weren&rsquo;t used just to make beer go down better. Ancient pagans used pungent greens as wards against the dead. Garlic, wolfsbane, and fennel were among a host of organic substances utilized as defenses against the beasties from the other side. So it only stands to reason that the best herb of them all&mdash;hops&mdash;should be a pretty damn solid choice to hold the dead at bay on Devil&rsquo;s Night.<br /><br />

I know I got my stash ready so I can throw down when Dracula comes knocking. I&rsquo;ve got a four pack of Great Lakes&rsquo; appropriately named <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=254">Nosferatu</a> in the fridge right now for me to drink while watching some <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001637/" target="_blank">Vincent Price</a> movies. (I know I gave Nosferatu four mugs in my review, but I&rsquo;m beginning to reconsider. Every time I have it I like it more and more.) Just in case, I&rsquo;ve got some Founders <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=176">Devil Dancer</a> in the cellar (well, technically, <i>everything</i> is in the cellar, since I live in a basement). Sure, it&rsquo;s from last year, but there&rsquo;s plenty of hops in there to keep my spiritual ass covered. And just in case there <i>aren&rsquo;t</i> enough hops, I&rsquo;ve still got my trusty bomber of Three Floyds&rsquo; <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=87">Dreadnaught</a> up on the shelf, waiting to save the day.<br /><br />

If you&rsquo;re more in the mood for a dark beer on a dark, ghastly night, there&rsquo;s always <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=307">Devil Over a Barrel</a> from Tyranena, or maybe you could pick up a sixer of Bell&rsquo;s<a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=37">Hell Hath No Fury&nbsp;&hellip;</a>, a great doppelbock that&rsquo;s out right now. You could stick with the whole Samhain bonfire theme with Capital&rsquo;s <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=50">Autumnal Fire</a>&mdash;if you&rsquo;ve had the willpower to not drink up your supply. And then you could always get Surly and celebrate darkness with <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=194">Darkness</a>.<br /><br />

No matter what beer you choose, make sure you have a quiet, somber&mdash;but safe&mdash;evening this Samhain&mdash;otherwise known to our bead-wearing brethren as Halloween. 1 0 1 2008-10-28 1 1 1 0
96 They Should Put Beer Fridges In The Voting Booths A rundown of beer issues that only a truly great president would address. Greetings, future people! It is I, the past Eddie Glick, writing this Tuesday morning, well before any election results are anywhere near available. I assure you I have no idea who has won this year&rsquo;s election. And although I&rsquo;m no political pundit, I do have a pretty good guess as to who&rsquo;ll be our next prez: Ron Paul. Seriously, if I had to make a prediction based on the number of bumper stickers and yard signs, I&rsquo;d say he was going to win by a landslide. Either him, or Ralph Nader.

I&rsquo;ve always considered myself apolitical, unless the fate of craft beer is involved. Sure, I pay attention to the issues and vote&mdash;like any self-respecting American should&mdash;but frankly, I&rsquo;m ticked off at all the major presidential candidates. Not a single one of them personally responded to my queries about how they stand on some extremely hot button issues. Such as:<br /><br />

<div class="bullet">
&bull; The legalization of home brewing in <i>every</i> state, city, and municipality in America. Right now it&rsquo;s still illegal to brew your own beer in redneck and/or bizarro states like Alabama and Utah. This needs to be rectified, <i>di di mau</i>.
</div>

<br />

<div class="bullet">
&bull; While we&rsquo;re on the subject of home brewing, that 200 gallons per person per household limit needs to get raised. Jug&rsquo;s hitting the ceiling and it&rsquo;s only the beginning of November!
</div>

<br />

<div class="bullet">
&bull; Self distribution for small breweries. This should be a federal mandate. Breweries shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to go through the &ldquo;three tier&rdquo; system found in a lot of states. Not only is it a breeding ground for corruption, but it plays right into the hands of big shit-beer producers like Anheuser-Busch. Fuck them.
</div>

<br />

<div class="bullet">
&bull; Truth in advertising. No, I&rsquo;m not talking about that Budweiser ad for the &ldquo;Great American Lager&rdquo; where you see a guy about to pour whole hops into a brewing vessel (whole-leaf hops haven&rsquo;t touched Bud in at least 30 years). My proposal is that bars that have signs for a beer must, in fact <i>serve that beer!</i> Nothing is more fucking annoying than to walk into an otherwise crappy bar and see a giant Founders or Lakefront sign, but then when you ask the waitress what Founders or Lakefront they have, she says, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a Founders?&rdquo; Gah!
</div>

<br />

When a candidate that comes along and addresses important issues like those, <i>then</i> I&rsquo;ll truly get excited about politics. Until then, I think we can all find some solace in this seemingly all-encompassing, never-ending rat race of an election. It is, after all, a reminder that we live in the greatest country in the world, where we are allowed to pursue the ultimate in happiness: good beer. In some countries you cannot vote. You cannot criticize whatever shithead is running the place. And in some countries you can&rsquo;t even drink a beer. So no matter who won&mdash;Nader or Paul&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to raise a glass of craft brewed beer in salute&mdash;and in thanks&mdash;to our nation&rsquo;s founding folks, who created the greatest political system in the history of the world: democracy. 1 0 1 2008-11-05 1 1 1 0
97 At Least Snoopy Served Popcorn Even if you&rsquo;re stuck eating oatmeal for Thanksgiving like Eddie this year, make the meal enjoyable by pairing it with Midwest craft beer. Bad news. Slick and Ma Glick are going on another weirdo cruise for the week of Thanksgiving. Sure, I get the whole house to myself (but no keys to the Gremlin&mdash;it&rsquo;s in the shop), but that also means no Thanksgiving meal. Instead, the menu will be like it is every other Thursday night: oatmeal and PB&amp;J, sans the J, unless I want to <i>walk</i> to the store like a fucking Neanderthal. Like I said, the Gremlin, a high performance machine, is in the shop for a tune up and detailing.<br /><br />

Normally you&rsquo;d say something along the lines of &ldquo;Sucks to be you, Eddie&nbsp;&hellip; as usual,&rdquo; but you&rsquo;d be wrong, because I have great Midwest craft beer to drink, so things can only get so bad. Plus, I&rsquo;m not into this whole autopitification nonsense that a lot of folks seem to be into nowadays. I mean, sitting around on the couch watching bad TV (a redundancy, that), pitying yourself over and over until it&rsquo;s too sore to pity anymore? Pretty pathetic. Instead, I&rsquo;m going to reach out to all of you readers out there who <i>will</i> have some Tom Turkey to worship come Thursday, along with a big scoop of tangy cranberry, fluffy stuffing, creamy mashed potatoes, buttery rolls, yellow peas, and a big-ass slice of pumpkin pie. Because I know of a sure-fire way you can make that bountiful feast a notch better: eat it while enjoying beer.<br /><br />

<div class="pullquote">
You&rsquo;ll want to start with a brew to get your stomach warmed up so you don&rsquo;t sprain it during the exertions you&rsquo;re about to put it through.
</div>

But simply cracking open a can of <a href="http://www.meisterbrau.com/" target="_blank">Meisterbru</a> at the start of Thanksgiving dinner won&rsquo;t do the trick. You have to make sure the brew you drink complements instead of ruins your mother-of-all-meals. Which is why I&rsquo;d like to direct you to the Beer Dorks <a href="/food.php">Midwest Beer And Food Pairing Guide</a>, if you&rsquo;re not already familiar with it. With this handy-dandy tool, you&rsquo;ll be able to pick out the perfect Midwest brew to go with every dish of your meal&mdash;including the course I invented, dessert II.<br /><br />

But if you&rsquo;re too lazy to peruse through our extraordinarily comprehensive list of to-do brews, I&rsquo;ll be certifiably nice and lay out an entire beer menu for you.<br /><br />

First off&mdash;before you even sit down and start passing the plates&mdash;is what the frogs call an <i>aperitif</i>. Basically a brew to get your stomach warmed up so you don&rsquo;t sprain it during the exertions you&rsquo;re about to put it through. You&rsquo;ll want something dry and hoppy, but mild and relatively uncomplex. I&rsquo;d recommend Three Floyds <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?id=1">Gumballhead</a>: perhaps a touch hoppier than you&rsquo;d want, but plenty light, with some fruity undertones. Two Brothers <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?rev_id=46">Prairie Path</a> would make an excellent starter as well, being as crisp and clean as my conscience, after all. Then there&rsquo;s the eponymous <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?id=452">Half Acre Lager</a>, which would be about as straightforward as you would want to get in a craft beer. Or try Summit <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?rev_id=271">Extra Pale Ale</a>, lighter and less hoppy than your typical American pale, a perfect way to get your taste buds begging for more.<br /><br />

</div>

Most &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; dinners will start with a salad, but at the Glick Thanskgiving gatherings we eschew that Nancy-ass crap and go right for the main course: turkey. The trick with turkey is it&rsquo;s lighter than you initially think. So you don&rsquo;t want anything too big and bold, otherwise it&rsquo;ll overpower the bird. But on the other hand, you&rsquo;ve got tangy cranberry and creamy taters that will render lighter beers tasteless. So you&rsquo;ve gotta find a brew that&rsquo;ll handle both extremes with equal aplomb. Obviously, no easy task, which is why you&rsquo;ve gotta turn to the Belgians.<br /><br />

Spicy and highly carbonated, Belgian-style beers can really cut the mustard when it comes to starchy and fatty foods, but they&rsquo;re light enough to let Mr. Turkey do his thing. The obvious choice here is the Midwest&rsquo;s best Belgian-style tripel, Dragonmead <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?id=249">Final Absolution</a>. Light and spicy, with lots of scrubbing bubbles and alcohol, it&rsquo;ll complement both your buttery rolls and your white turkey meat. Furthermore&rsquo;s <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?rev_id=241">Fatty Boombalatty</a> is a great second choice, but might be a hair too subtle for the heavier fare. If you like dark meat and pile the cranberry high, maybe look at Dark Horse <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?rev_id=150">Amber Ale</a>, a brew with more body than a golden, but lots of spiciness to stand up against hearty sides. Also along those lines is Bell&rsquo;s <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?rev_id=37">Hell Hath No Fury&nbsp;&hellip; Ale</a>, a fantastic Belgian-style dubbel that drinks lighter than you&rsquo;d expect for the style.<br /><br />

OK, you&rsquo;ve survived the dinner. Bring on the dessert! Big ass stouts are needed now to take on all that sugary goodness. You cannot, I repeat, <i>cannot</i> go wrong with Founders <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?id=60">Breakfast Stout</a>. Big, rich, and smoooooooth, it&rsquo;ll triple your enjoyment of any dessert you pair with it. Great Lakes <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?rev_id=296">Blackout Stout</a> is another silky-smooth, big brew that&rsquo;ll go perfectly with apple pie or cherry cheesecake. Then there&rsquo;s Goose Island <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?rev_id=242">Bourbon County Stout</a>, which&rsquo;ll stand up to anything you could throw up against it, even, say, a solid block of chocolate.<br /><br />

Dessert&mdash;done. After you&rsquo;ve washed the dishes and taken that pre-bedtime nap, you&rsquo;ve gotta do a cooldown to make sure your poor, distended belly won&rsquo;t be all cramped up and sore for the rest of the week. Again, the frogs got a word for this procedure, too: the <i>digestif</i>. Between you and me, we&rsquo;ll call it a night cap. That means something that you can sip and savor, with a soothing alcoholic kick to usher in some pleasant food-centric dreams. Like Founders <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?rev_id=62">Curmudgeon</a>, an old ale that&rsquo;s guaranteed to lube your tubes and numb your pubes. You could do a lot worse than Central Waters <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?rev_id=258">Bourbon Barrel Barleywine</a>, a pleasingly complex, bourbon-soaked brew to close out the night. But personally, I&rsquo;ve found that nothing mollifies an overburdened gullet like hops, so at the end of a long day of cramming my piehole, I grab an imperial IPA, like Three Floyds <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?rev_id=87">Dreadnaught</a>. Big, bitter, but balanced, I swear it&rsquo;d probably cure malaria if taken at a high enough dosage.<br /><br />

So there you go. Lots of head candy for making your turkey day meal all the more spectacular. Drink up, enjoy, and give thanks. Just don&rsquo;t think of me, poor Eddie Glick, licking clean my bowl of oatmeal and pining on for just a tiny smear of grape jelly to adorn my bland peanut butter sammie.

98 Is This Year <i>Over</i> Yet? Suicide at this time of year is trite, so let&rsquo;s instead spend time with our insane families and peruse end-of-the-year lists. Now that we&rsquo;re getting closer to the end of the year, we&rsquo;ve got all kinds of things to look forward to. You know, the <a href="/articles.php?article_id=54">winter solstice</a>, the beginning of <i>real</i> winter, crap-sandwich pro football games, prolonged forced closed-quarters interaction with family members who are clearly infuckingsane&nbsp;&hellip; and end-of-the-year lists. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love a good list, but I don&rsquo;t quite understand why we have to wait until the end of the year to compile them. How about a list in, say, June. You know, a 5/12-of-the-year list.<br /><br />

One list that caught my attention was <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/" target="_blank">BeerAdvocate</a>&lsquo;s &ldquo;All-Time Top Beers on Planet Earth&rdquo; list in the most recent issue of <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/mag/issues" target="_blank">their magazine</a>. When it comes to BeerAdvocate&rsquo;s rankings, there&rsquo;re a couple things you need to keep in mind. First, since all of their content is user-generated, we don&rsquo;t exactly know who it is that is ranking and reviewing all this beer. They could be highly educated beer experts, people who think Coronoa is &ldquo;exotic,&rdquo; folks who use the site as a social network, marketing employees for Anheuser-Busch, or just plain crazies. It&rsquo;s probably a rich tapestry of all of the above and then some, which means you&rsquo;ve gotta take at least some of those rankings with a grain of salt.<br /><br />

Second, BeerAdvocate&rsquo;s membership has become so huge now&mdash;it passed 100,000 users early in &rsquo;08&mdash;that the beers that enjoy the larger distribution areas are going to get more coverage&mdash;and more reviews&mdash;than brews with smaller target audiences. You&rsquo;d think this would mean a handful of grade-A reviews for an otherwise obscure beer would propel it to the top of the list, but BeerAdvocate uses a statistical system that counter-weights rankings by number of reviews. So a brew with tons of above-average reviews will rank higher than a brew with only five&mdash;but all A-plus-plus&mdash;reviews. That means as the BeerAdvocate membership grows in a presumably uniform pattern geographically, the more widely available brands are going to creep past beers that are only available in, say, Hawaii. Hence the disappearance of <a href="http://www.surlybrewing.com/" target="_blank">Surly Brewing</a>, last year&rsquo;s top-ranked brewery, whose brews you can only get in the Minneapolis area and select bars in Chicago.<br /><br />

Like I said before, take this list with a grain of salt. But here it is, with what I think of each entry (in the off chance that anybody out there cares):<br /><br />

<b>1. Trappistes Rochefort 10</b><br />
Quadrupel, 11.3 percent <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=ABV&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">ABV</a><br />
Brasserie de Rochefort (Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Saint-R&eacute;may, Belgium)
<div class="shim"></div>

<i>That</i> took a goddamn long time to type. I&rsquo;ve had this beer at least once, and I honestly cannot remember anything distinctive about it. Needless to say, I don&rsquo;t agree with its numero uno ranking.<br /><br />

<b>2. Stone Russian Imperial Stout</b><br />
Russian Imperial Stout, 10.8 percent ABV<br />
Stone Brewing Company (Escondido, CA)
<div class="shim"></div>

Stone actually landed in the number one spot on the top breweries list, and I would say that they are worthy holders of the title. However, I&rsquo;ve never had a chance to sample their imperial stout.<br /><br />

<b>3. St. Bernardus Abt 12</b><br />
Quadrupel, 10.5 percent ABV<br />
Brouwerij St. Bernanardus NV (Watou, Belgium)
<div class="shim"></div>

I&rsquo;ve had this brew several times, and although it is a great beer, there are far better Belgians out there. So I&rsquo;m a little perplexed as to why this brew scored so high, other than the fact that it&rsquo;s pretty widely available.<br /><br />

<b>4. Founders Breakfast Stout</b><br />
American Double/Imperial Stout, 8.3 percent ABV<br />
Founders Brewing Company (Grand Rapids, MI)
<div class="shim"></div>

Damn right this is in the top five. An unbelievable beer, as <a href="/reviews.php?id=60">I&rsquo;ve already noted</a>. In fact&nbsp;&hellip; hang on while I go grab one from the fridge.<br /><br />

<b>5. Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock</b><br />
Doppelbock, 6.7 percent ABV<br />
Brauerei Aying, (Aying, Germany)
<div class="shim"></div>

Meh. Spaten Optimator is better. Ayinger <i>does</i> come with a plastic goat ornament, though.<br /><br />

<b>6. Dreadnaught IPA</b><br />
American Double/Imperial IPA, 9.5 percent ABV<br />
Three Floyds Brewing Company (Munster, IN)
<div class="shim"></div>

Fearing the collapse of society, I recently went out and bought a 12-pack case of <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=87">Dreadnaught</a> bombers. (<i>That</i> put a dent in Ma and Slick's wallet.) It&rsquo;s a miracle I haven&rsquo;t drank all of it yet. I like to exercise what we big boys like to call &ldquo;self control.&rdquo;<br /><br />

<b>7. Storm King Stout</b><br />
Russian Imperial Stout, 9.1 percent ABV<br />
Victory Brewing Company (Downington, PA)
<div class="shim"></div>

Victory is an amazing, highly underrated brewery, and Storm King is <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=118">an amazing beer</a>. I&rsquo;m glad it made the list.<br /><br />

<b>8. Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier</b><br />
Hefeweizen, 5.4 percent ABV<br />
Brauerei Weihenstephan (Freising, Germany)
<div class="shim"></div>

If any hefe could be ranked in the top 10, it&rsquo;d have to be this one. The world&rsquo;s oldest brewery still makes damn great beer.<br /><br />

<b>9. Two Hearted Ale</b><br />
American IPA, 7.0 percent ABV<br />
Bell&rsquo;s Brewery (Kalamazoo, MI)
<div class="shim"></div>

Despite <a href="/articles.php?article_id=77">my IPA rankings</a>, I have no qualms seeing this ranked as the highest straight IPA in the list. It&rsquo;s <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=55">a damn good beer</a>.<br /><br />

<b>10. 90 Minute IPA</b><br />
American Double/Imperial IPA, 9.0 percent ABV<br />
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery (Milton, DE)
<div class="shim"></div>

I don&rsquo;t understand the fascination with this beer. It&rsquo;s a <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=23">solid double IPA</a>, but I wouldn&rsquo;t call it outstanding. It&rsquo;s also probably the most widely distributed double out there&nbsp;&hellip;<br /><br />

<b>11. Stone Ruination IPA</b><br />
American Double/Imperial IPA, 9.0 percent ABV<br />
Stone Brewing Company (Escondido, CA)
<div class="shim"></div>

I must say I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of this one, although <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=332">a lot of folks love it</a>. Stone is a great brewery, but I&rsquo;ve always finished my bombers of Ruination with a bad taste in my mouth. Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t rank it in the upper echelons of doubles.<br /><br />

<b>12. Hopslam Ale</b><br />
American Double/Imperial IPA, 10.0 percent ABV<br />
Bell&rsquo;s Brewery (Kalamazoo, MI)
<div class="shim"></div>

This beer is <a href="/reviews.php?id=55">frickin&rsquo; wild</a>. All hop flavor&mdash;and <i>tons</i> of it, at that&mdash;with next to no hop bitterness. Larry Bell is an evil genius.<br /><br />

<b>13. La Fin Du Monde</b><br />
Tripel, 9.0 percent ABV<br />
Unibroue (Chambly, Quebec)
<div class="shim"></div>

I&rsquo;ve always thought of Unibroue as a poor man&rsquo;s Chimay, but that&rsquo;d still be one rich poor man. This is a fantastic beer, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s even their best offering. Their Don De Dieu, a wheat triple, is even better, as hard as that is to believe.<br /><br />

<b>14. Aventinus</b><br />
Weizenbock, 8.0 percent ABV<br />
Private Weissbierbrauerei G. Schneider &amp; Sohn GmbH (Kelheim, Germany)
<div class="shim"></div>

To me this is one of the most incredible beers in the world. Each sip is a revelation of the brewer&rsquo;s art at its pinnacle. If there isn&rsquo;t at least one Aventinus in the fridge at all times, I can&rsquo;t sleep at night.<br /><br />

<b>15. Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout</b><br />
Russian Imperial Stout, 9.0 percent ABV<br />
North Coast Brewing Company (Fort Bragg, CA)
<div class="shim"></div>

I&rsquo;ve had this once, and I wasn&rsquo;t all that pleased with it. (<a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=184">Nigel wasn&rsquo;t either</a>). I&rsquo;d need to try it a few more times to officially poo-poo it. Or&nbsp;&hellip; what&rsquo;s the opposite of poo-poo? Pee-pee?<br /><br />

<b>16. Duvel</b><br />
Belgian Strong Pale Ale, 8.5 percent ABV<br />
Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV (Breendonk-Puurs, Belgium)
<div class="shim"></div>

Once again, it&rsquo;s pronounced DOO-vl, and it&rsquo;s easily one of the world&rsquo;s great beers. I&rsquo;ve got a four-pack in the fridge for Christmas dinner.<br /><br />

<b>17. Stone IPA</b><br />
American IPA, 6.9 percent ABV<br />
Stone Brewing Company (Escondido, CA)
<div class="shim"></div>

A <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=332">great IPA</a> that earns its right to be in the top 25.<br /><br />

<b>18. Double Bastard Ale</b><br />
American Strong Ale, 10.0 percent ABV<br />
Stone Brewing Company (Escondido, CA)
<div class="shim"></div>

See my comments below for Arrogant Bastard. Or read <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=378">Nigel&rsquo;s review</a>.<br /><br />

<b>19. Chocolate Stout</b><br />
American Stout, 6.0 percent ABV<br />
Rogue Ales (Newport, OR)
<div class="shim"></div>

Rogue is another one of those awesome breweries that you don&rsquo;t hear a lot about. Their chocolate is a great stout, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s even their best beer in a huge lineup just dripping with quality.<br /><br />

<b>20. Hop Rod Rye</b><br />
American IPA, 8.0 percent ABV<br />
Bear Republic Brewing Company (Healdsburg, CA)
<div class="shim"></div>

I love my hoppy beers, and I love &rsquo;em even more with rye. This a great brew from one of the better California breweries.<br /><br />

<b>21. Tr&ouml;egs Nugget Nectar</b><br />
American Amber/Red Ale, 7.5 percent ABV<br />
Tr&ouml;egs Brewing Company (Harrisburg, PA)
<div class="shim"></div>

OK, I&rsquo;m stumped. Never even seen this beer before. But I vow to try it if I ever come across it in the future.<br /><br />

<b>22. Arrogant Bastard Ale</b><br />
American Strong Ale, 7.2 percent ABV<br />
Stone Brewing Company (Escondido, CA)
<div class="shim"></div>

Let&rsquo;s face it: no one actually <i>likes</i> this beer. You don&rsquo;t lay in bed at night licking your lips, craving this brew, unless you look forward to running <a href="http://www.badwater.com/" target="_blank">ultra marathons</a>. Because that&rsquo;s what this beer is about: finishing it. It even says right on the bottle: You aren&rsquo;t going to like this beer. Because you&rsquo;re not supposed to drink it, you&rsquo;re supposed to wrestle it until you finish it or stumble away, thankful that your taste buds aren&rsquo;t burned to a crisp (if, in fact, they aren&rsquo;t). So, should it be in the top 25 beers in the world? You bet your ass it should.<br /><br />

<b>23. Trappistes Rochefort 8</b><br />
Belgian Strong Dark Ale, 9.2 percent ABV<br />
Brasserie de Rochefort (Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Saint-R&eacute;may, Belgium)
<div class="shim"></div>

I&rsquo;ve also had this one several times, and also have absolutely no memory of how it tasted. It just did not stand out to me. Maybe I&rsquo;m missing something with this brewery&nbsp;&hellip;<br /><br />

<b>24. Shakespeare Stout</b><br />
American Stout, 6.0 percent ABV<br />
Rogue Ales (Newport, OR)
<div class="shim"></div>

Another great beer from Rogue, probably better than their chocolate version. I can&rsquo;t blame anyone for putting this beer where it is in the list.<br /><br />

<b>25. Chimay Grande R&eacute;serve (Blue)</b><br />
Belgian Strong Dark Ale, 9.0 percent ABV<br />
Bi&egrave;res de Chimay (Abbay Notre Dame de Scourmont, Belgium)
<div class="shim"></div>

World class. If you haven&rsquo;t had it, something is missing from your life.<br /><br />

And that's the list! Now that we&rsquo;re done occupying ourselves, that means we have nothing else better to do than think about the impending holidays. And spending all that quality time with (gulp) family. But remember: there&rsquo;s always beer. Wassail! 1 0 1 2008-12-16 1 1 1 0
99 &rsquo;Tis Better To Give, THEN You Can Receive! A home brewing kit for the first-time brewer is a gift that&rsquo;ll keep on giving&mdash;to you, hopefully. If you are like me, this week kicks off the official start of holiday shopping. Today I start to think of gift ideas for my friends and family. Tomorrow or Tuesday, I&rsquo;ll start shopping for the items I came up with during the football commercials. (Sorry, <a href="http://www.jared.com/" target="_blank">Jared</a>, I am immune to your annoying commercials).<br /><br />

One of the logical choices a beer dork will come to is, of course, beer. Who wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy opening a delicious, malty present Christmas morning? This is a gift that will rival an <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/beerdorks.84751403" target="_blank">Eddie Glick autographed thong</a> for popularity. But unlike the thong, the beer is unlikely to survive the holiday. Once consumed, the gift you carefully chose will be, except for the pleasant memory, gone.<br /><br />

For the serious beer lover, I would suggest a gift that will reap you dividends. A starter brew kit. This is exactly how I started home brewing eight years ago. I received a basic starter kit as a gift. I know how intimidating this can sound to someone that has no inkling about the brewing process, but trust me, <i>anyone</i> can learn to do.<br /><br />

The beginning brewer should start with brewing from extracts. Forget everything you see for all grain brewing for now. Think of this as baking a cake from Betty Crocker cake mix as opposed to making one from scratch. There is nothing wrong with a Betty Crocker cake, and it is a much easier way to learn the ropes than starting with all the raw ingredients.<br /><br />

</div>

The first thing you will have to do is select a place to purchase this equipment. I do advise, as always, shopping locally. If you have a home brewing supply store near you, use them. The service and knowledge you receive from them will be priceless. I can vouch for the <a href="http://www.wineandhop.com/" target="_blank">Wine &amp; Hop Shop</a> in the Madison area. If you do not have a store near you, <a href="http://midwestsupplies.com/" target="_blank">Midwest Supplies</a> has very reasonable shipping rates and a huge selection of extract-based recipe kits.<br /><br />

Most homebrew shops sell everything you need to start brewing as kits. Most basic kits range from $60 to $100 depending on accessory upgrades. My advice is to start simple. No need for the biggest and best kit for the new home brewer to create that first ale. Buy the most basic kit since it&rsquo;s easy&mdash;and fun as Hell&mdash;for recipients to add to their arsenal as they gain more brewing prowess.<br /><br />

Your first beer-making kit should include:
<div class="spacer10"></div>

<div class="bullet">&bull; A 6.5 gallon fermenter (it&rsquo;s just a food-grade plastic pail) with a lid</div>
<div class="bullet">&bull; A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_lock" target="_blank">fermentation lock</a></div>
<div class="bullet">&bull; Siphon tubing</div>
<div class="bullet">&bull; A bottle brush</div>
<div class="bullet">&bull; Bottle caps</div>
<div class="bullet">&bull; A <a href="http://www.midwestsupplies.com/products/ProdBySubCat.aspx?SubCat=760" target="_blank">bottle filler</a></div>
<div class="bullet">&bull; A bottle capper</div>
<div class="bullet">&bull; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060531053?tag=sportsdorks-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0060531053&adid=0BX5402YWTYTHGTCX8W6&" target="_blank">The Complete Joy of Home Brewing</a> book by Charlie Papazian</div>

<br />

There are several other items that are nice but not required such as a bottling bucket, glass carboy and accessories, siphon pump and hydrometer. These can always be added later.<br /><br />

Now you will need a few things that will not come in the kit:
<div class="spacer10"></div>

<div class="bullet">&bull; You will, of course, need bottles. You can simply reuse the ones your craft beer comes in (but no twist offs!), or you can buy them where you purchase your starter kit.</div>
<div class="bullet">&bull; A simple kitchen thermometer</div>
<div class="bullet">&bull; A colander</div>
<div class="bullet">&bull; A 12 quart kettle</div>

<br />

Now all you need is to select a beer kit! Every home brew supply store sells these. They usually come with everything needed to brew with an option for dry or liquid yeast. I strongly suggest getting the liquid yeast. I would also suggest selecting an ale over a lager for starting out. Selecting just one kit may be the hardest part of this whole process. If you cannot decide, opt for a holiday brew kit. These are always popular, plus they&rsquo;re seasonal.<br /><br />

Now you know everything you need to give the perfect gift. And the best part is, this is truly the gift that keeps on giving. No beer dork blessed by such a gift will deny you, the giver, a few bottles of their first homebrew!<br /><br />

Prosit! 7 0 7 2008-12-21 1 1 1 0
100 Feel The Fire Eddie and Jug finally and semi-definitively prove whether Capital Brewery?s Autumnal Fire recipe has been tweaked?or wrenched?from year to year. So I got invited over to <a href="/contact_us.php?user_id=7">Jug Dunningan</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;house&rdquo; the other night. I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; when referring to where Jug lives. Sure, there&rsquo;s four walls and a roof, and he spends most of his time there. But in all other aspects it resembles a brewery more than a house. First, you walk in and you about fall over a fifty pound bag of malted barley in front of the door. This is right next to a giant closet that is stacked with boxes and sacks of barley, wheat, rye, and a host of other adjunct grains. Then you get into the &ldquo;living&rdquo; room. There&rsquo;s all varieties of fermenters in there: glass carboys, plastic ale pails, mini stainless steel vessels. All a-bubbling with his latest brews. There&rsquo;s also a giant black spot on the wall where some piece of equipment burned up while he was out of town birding or hunting or getting married or some damn thing. When the cops called to tell him his &ldquo;house&rdquo; was on fire, he yelled &ldquo;Is the beer OK?&rdquo; Which, thank Jebus, it was. In fact, the firemen used the grain bag to prop open the door while they hosed the wall down.<br /><br />

Then you stumble into the kitchen, where, of course, there&rsquo;s a fridge. (There&rsquo;s also a coffee maker, which has been known to be brewing beer. I&rsquo;m NOT shitting you.) You&rsquo;d think there&rsquo;d be beer in the fridge, but you&rsquo;d be wrong. Instead there&rsquo;s a bunch of bottles that <i>look</i> like beer, except they&rsquo;ve got stoppers with airlocks jammed into them. These would be <a href="/articles.php?article_id=78">yeast cultures</a>. My advice is don&rsquo;t drink any of these if you happen across them. Sure, they&rsquo;ll straighten out virtually any digestive problems you might be experiencing, but they&rsquo;re a little&nbsp;&hellip; yeasty in the palate. Plus, Jug gets really pissed when you drink his house yeast. Not that I would know firsthand or anything.<br /><br />

For the record, the beer fridge is in the basement, and it&rsquo;s usually filled to bursting with bombers of home brew.<br /><br />

Anway, it&rsquo;s not very often I get invited to Jug&rsquo;s house&mdash;or anybody&rsquo;s house, for that matter&mdash;and since it&rsquo;s a bit of a haul to his place from my parents&rsquo;, I decided to bring a special treat: a bottle of Capital Brewery <a href="/reviews.php?id=102">Autumnal Fire</a> from each of the last four years. You may recall from about a year ago that I <a href="/articles.php?article_id=52">tasted the 2005, 2006, and 2007 vintages</a> side by side by side to see if they differed. It was my theory that Capital had not just tweaked the recipe from previous years, but changed it quite drastically by lightening it up. Or, as I&rsquo;d like to call it, dumbing it down. My results were only slightly conclusive, since I couldn&rsquo;t pin down whether the differences in the various vintages were more due to the aging process rather than Capital tinkering with the recipe. But now, with four years to compare, I think we&rsquo;ve got some more concrete evidence.<br /><br />

First, a quick recap on the effects of aging on beer. It basically dulls hoppiness while accentuating malt and alcohol. All these beers were stored here in the basement, at a around 72&deg;. Although you probably want to store beers at a cooler temp when cellaring, this is the best I can do until Ma throws out all her jars of dill pickles and lets me start using the root cellar. Like that&rsquo;ll every happen.<br /><br />

Without further ado, into the fire we go&nbsp;&hellip;<br /><br />

The &rsquo;05 and &rsquo;06 versions pour a deep, dark, slightly viscous brown, with virtually no head. The &rsquo;07 Autumnal pours quite a bit lighter&mdash;a slightly cloudy dark amber, with a small, short-lived head. This year&rsquo;s (the 2008, just to clarify) is noticeably lighter, bright and clear, a gorgeous iridescent dark ruby color, with a perfect finger&rsquo;s worth of head.<br /><br />

Smell-wise, the first two years are <i>super</i> malty&mdash;on deep sniffs visions of boiling grain come to mind. Raisin-like notes waft out of the glasses in dark intoxicating waves. The &rsquo;07 has a huge malt/grainy nose as well, but nothing compared to its predecessors, and with only hints of the dark fruit. The &rsquo;08 version&rsquo;s aroma is more dry and biscuit-like than grainy, and there are some very light hop notes at the far edges of the whiffs.<br /><br />

<div class="pullquote">
Once a brewer starts putting things like cost and marketability above the <i>quality</i> of the beer, then the brewer is moving away from being a craft brewer.
</div>

Like last year&rsquo;s tasting, the &rsquo;05 is <i>all</i> thick maltiness; syrupy sweet overtones to a giant-ass, velvety smooth body, transforming into a boozy, warming finish. The &rsquo;06, however, wasn&rsquo;t so lucky. Jug, after only half a sip, was the first to point out that it was <i>way</i> oxidized, almost to the point of being undrinkable. This isn&rsquo;t the least bit surprising, since sometimes it can take only a matter of months before some brews get skunked this way. The &rsquo;06 bottle was moderately oxidized in last year&rsquo;s tasting, so it could be that that batch was more susceptible, or maybe I got a sixer with a poor seal on the caps. Whatever it is, for tasting purposes the &rsquo;06 is pretty much useless for our experiments.<br /><br />

The Fire from 2007 is lighter in body and sharper in the palate. The malt is quite pronounced, and there are more than hints of raisins and plums, although nowhere near what the &rsquo;05 exhibited. This year&rsquo;s is even lighter, almost to the point that you&rsquo;d describe the body as &ldquo;medium,&rdquo; with the biscuity malt aspects dominating, at least in the middle of the sip. Some sweet, dark notes lurk in the edges, but a hop and carbonation combo at the end provides a (comparitively, of course&mdash;Autumnal Fire is still a big beer) short, crisp finish.<br /><br />

And the verdict is&nbsp;&hellip; the recipe was, indeed, tweaked between the 2006 and 2007 batches. Hell, not just tweaked, but <i>cranked</i>. [<i>Editor&rsquo;s Note:</i> <a href="/articles.php?article_id=103">Read the follow up</a> to this assertion.] While the differences between the &rsquo;05 and the &rsquo;06 were fairly small&mdash;save for the oxidation&mdash;between those and the last two years is <i>HUGE</i>. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d say they were almost different beers&mdash;it <i>is</i> possible to pick out similarities&mdash;but there is absolutely not doubt that the malt bill has lightened considerably in the last two batches.<br /><br />

<div class="pullquote">
Autumnal Fire used to be a huge, challenging beer, but immensely rewarding to those who dared to finish a glass or two.
</div>

And so what? If Capital wants to tweak the recipe from year to year, that&rsquo;s their prerogative. Frankly, it was great fun tasting the different vintages and sharing our thoughts on each. But what <i>does</i> concern me is the <i>why</i> for the tweak. Does the Capital brewmaster Kirby Nelson&mdash;and/or someone else calling the shots in Middleton&mdash;just like his Fire a little lighter and easier on the palate? If so, I don&rsquo;t have a beef with that. There is, as the saying goes, no accounting for taste. But if it was for some <i>other</i> reason, such as, let&rsquo;s say, because the accountants wanted to cut back on the barley bill or the marketing people thought they could get better penetration if the beer was more &ldquo;accessible&rdquo; to a larger pool of consumers, <i>then</i> I have a problem. A big fucking problem. Because once a brewer starts putting things like cost and marketability above the <i>quality</i> of the beer, then the brewer is moving away from being a craft brewer. And there&rsquo;s only one way to go when moving away from being a craft beer brewer: a shit beer brewer.<br /><br />

Capital has a long way to go before becoming a shit beer producer, but it is my opinion that the quality of Autumnal Fire has suffered in the last couple of years. It used to be a huge, challenging beer, but immensely rewarding to those who dared to finish a glass or two. Now, although still an amazingly good doppel, it has lost a lot of its bite, audacity, and, thusly, its rich reward. It is now just another very good beer in a market that increasingly has more very good beers.<br /><br />

After a mere four sips (and several gravity measurements&mdash;Jug has an <i>awesome</i> set of brewing tools) Jug was so disgusted with our revelation that he slammed his glass down and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m not buying another Autumnal Fire again.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll go that far. But the magic of that original sip of Fire has without doubt worn off. And we can only lament its passing.<br /><br />

Until Capital decides to tweak the recipe again&nbsp;&hellip; 1 0 1 2009-01-12 1 1 1 0
101 Beers I Have Known Everyone&rsquo;s got a handful of those &ldquo;touchstone beer moments&rdquo; that help define what kind of beer dork one really is. I love reading and hearing the stories from craft brewers and connoisseurs who were ardent <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=shit beer&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">shit beer</a> drinkers their entire lives until a single sip of good beer instantly and irrevocably changed their view of beer. Like all it took was for a single pint of Bass Ale for an otherwise stalwart Blatz drinker to wake up the very next day, quit his office job, and buy a bar that he stocks with obscure craft beers from around the world.<br /><br />

Romantic, but completely unbelievable. I&rsquo;ve known far more stalwart shit beer drinkers in my life than beer dorks, and only a handful of the Bud Light or Old Style fans I&rsquo;ve known has even considered completely giving up their favorite swill for locally brewed craft beer, and that came about over a period of, literally, years. While every beer dork I&rsquo;ve met <i>also</i> took a varying number of years to become the bull-headed beer snob that I&rsquo;ve come to know and, yes, perhaps even tolerate.<br /><br />

<div class="imgBoxPortrait"><img src="/imx/22_1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="375" border="0" /></div>That&rsquo;s not to say that everyone who enjoys good craft brews doesn&rsquo;t have those &ldquo;touchstone&rdquo; beers where they discovered some new and wonderful taste that instantly sears the moment into their memories forever. In fact, I have more than a few of those moments&mdash;and, more importanly, beers&mdash;burned into the various cortices of my brain that have influenced my tastes and preferences during my continuing journey deeper and deeper into beer dorkdom.<br /><br />

To wit:<br /><br />

<b>Sprecher Amber</b><br />
Summer, a handful of years ago. I was at a baseball game. I love all the major sports&mdash;football, baseball, cricket&mdash;but there&rsquo;s no sport as enjoyable seeing live as baseball, whether it&rsquo;s major or unaffiliated minor league. And there&rsquo;s nothing like a cold brew at a baseball game. Despite that, at this baseball game and I didn&rsquo;t even plan on having a beer, since I had to drive a good distance afterward and I assumed the vendors would only be peddling watery swill anyway. To my utter shock, a beer cart a pop-fly from my seat had Sprecher Amber on tap. So I grabbed a hot dog, a pint, and some peanuts, and plopped my ass in my seat for the game to start. Almost off-handedly I took my first sip and was astonished with the crystal malt pop the beer gave off, while still being smooth and drinkable. I&rsquo;d had Sprecher Amber before, but this was the first time I really <i>tasted</i> it. It&rsquo;s still to this day one of my favorite ambers in the Midwest, if not the country.<br /><br />

<b>Schneider Aventinus</b><br />
This wheat doppelbock from Germany (&ldquo;weizenstarkbier&rdquo;&mdash;gotta love those German words) is an absolute beer treasure. The first time I had it, I was in some fancy-pants bar in Chicago while the parental units were next door consuming rotten grape juice while listening to piano music. I pawed through the menu looking for a beer list amid an endless drivel of wine and champagne. There was some Heineken, a couple of Mexican beers, Anchor Steam, and a beer I&rsquo;d never heard of called Aventinus. Instead of sticking with the safe Anchor, I ordered up this Aventinus, despite the fact it cost a whopping eight bucks. Boy am I glad I did. It came in a uniquely shaped wheat beer glass designed to hold the entire 16.9-ounce bottle, as well as the massive, pillowy head. The aroma was a cornucopia of bright bananas, dark raisins, and spicy cloves. But it was the very first taste that blew me away: dark and malty, dry and yeasty, light and fruity, all at the <i>same fucking time!</i> Plus, 8.2 percent <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=ABV&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">ABV</a>. Beats shitty ass wine any day of the week, and that&rsquo;s including Sundays.<br /><br />

<b>Founders Red&rsquo;s Rye</b><br />
This <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=14">super-hoppy rye brew</a> had me not at the first sip, but at the first <i>sniff</i>. I was walking from the beer fridge to the couch. It was a Monday night. Football was on. That annoying commercial break between the kickoff and the first play was just ending, and <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Al_Michaels" target="_blank">Al Michaels</a> was talking about something, probably the weather. I lifted my pint glass to my schnoz for a quick whiff. And I froze dead in my tracks. That blast of Amarillo in the nose was the most incredible &ldquo;beer&rdquo; smell I&rsquo;d ever come across. The Europeans sometimes refer to the aroma of Amarillo and other American hops as &ldquo;cat pee&rdquo; because its assertiveness offends their staid and stale sensibilities, but to me it was a revelation. And the sipping only helped brand that memory into my skull, what with the complex blend of malty goodness, powerful bitterness, and rye spiciness. Another astonishingly great beer from an astonishingly great brewery.<br /><br />

<b>Chimay Blue</b><br />
This was my first taste of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/093738187X?ie=UTF8&tag=sportsdorks-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=093738187X" target="_blank">monk-brewed</a> (or, at least, contract-brewed) beer. At a restaurant, looking through the beer list. Nothing worth drinking, except Chimay Blue. I&rsquo;d heard of it and knew it had a reputation. But <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=105x6976646#6977223" target="_blank">Heineken</a> and <a href="http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/7653627-post164.html" target="_blank">Carlsberg</a> also had a reputation. So I warily ordered up an 11.2-ounce bottle. It came in its own goblet, which was pretty cool, but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily means a beer is any good. Again, it took only one sip to convince me that this was one fantastic brew. Dark fruits meticulously interlaced with Belgian yeastiness. Smoooooth. One of the world&rsquo;s great beers, and a great choice whether you&rsquo;re eating with a hot date at an upscale Thai joint or in your basement all alone with a sackful of Taco Bell. Yeah, I love Thai food&nbsp;&hellip;<br /><br />

<b>Capital Autumnal Fire</b><br />
A friendly enemy of mine, a peculiar individual by the name of Pid Purdy, invited me over to his crap shack for a cutthroat game of cribbage. It was late September, years ago. I&rsquo;d been sitting in the car during a late Midwestern heat wave for something like five hours to get to Pid the Squid&rsquo;s place. The Gremlin <i>is</i> a high performance machine, and it doesn&rsquo;t have room for pedestrian niceties like air conditioning or seat belts. So needless to say I wasn&rsquo;t in a good mood. I sat down at the fold-out card table and started checking the deck for any marks&mdash;Pid&rsquo;s been known to bend the rules on more than one occasion. He came back from the fridge with two bottles of beer. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try a couple of these,&rdquo; he said. I was a little shocked he had craft beer in the house. Usually his fridge is jam packed with health food and shit like Corona. But no. This time he was offering a bottle of <a href="/reviews.php?id=102">Autumnal Fire</a>. It was early in my beer dork years. I had yet to try it, and actually knew very little about it. Autumnal Fire had a reputation as a beer not for beginners, and Pid&rsquo;s demeanor was somber and serious, like he was suggesting we try our hand at becoming international mercenaries in an African blood diamond war. We cranked open the bottles, gave each other the stink eye, then simultaneously sipped. My memory is that it was brutally malty, and aggressively hopped. And mind-blowingly delicious. I had had Stone Arrogant Bastard for the first time only a few months before, and I remember Autumnal Fire rivalling that notorious brew in both complexity and the challenge it presented to finish it. Maybe my palate&rsquo;s changed that much or my memory isn&rsquo;t what I thought it was, but I&rsquo;ve posited before that even though this is still a great beer, it seems it <a href="/articles.php?article_id=100">isn&rsquo;t what it once was</a>. Oh yeah, I skunked Pid once and swept him on a seven-game set. That was almost as good as the beer&nbsp;&hellip;<br /><br />

Those are five of my touchstone beer moments, part of the reason beer dorks like us are constantly on the prowl, looking for that next craft brew that will give our noses and taste buds a ride that we&rsquo;ll remember for damn near forever. Anyone else got a beer memory zapped into the back your forehead you wouldn&rsquo;t mind sharing? We&rsquo;re all ears. 1 0 1 2009-01-26 1 1 1 0
102 Alien Beer It&rsquo;s international month at BeerDorks.com as we look at the great historical brews and new breed of craft beer from around the globe. On the day after the single greatest celebration of American popular culture&mdash;the Super Bowl&mdash;leave it to the Dorks to look in the exact opposite way to celebrate another world treasure that seemingly has next to nothing to do with the hype machine of the United States: internationally produced beer. That&rsquo;s right. This February we&rsquo;re going to focus on the plethora of great beer brewed outside America&rsquo;s borders by talking about it, drinking it, and reviewing it. Some readers may be mystified as to why a site dedicated to Midwest craft beer would shift its focus to the other side of the globe, but in actuality it makes sense to turn our eyes outward every so often to see what else is out there.<br /><br />

At the dawn of the American craft beer revolution, brewers did just that and looked to other continents&mdash;mainly Europe&mdash;for inspiration and ideas. Except for a tiny handful of regional or smaller breweries scattered across the U.S., virtually all American breweries specialized in one beer style alone: light lagers. In other words, <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=shit beer&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">shit beer</a>. Only in areas like Europe were other kinds of beer still alive. And this is where the new breed of American brewers started when they wanted to expand their beer horizons.<br /><br />

<div id="img1" class="portrait"><img src="/imx/102_1.jpg" alt="" border="0" width="300" height="373" class="portrait" /></div>
Now European brewers are looking back at their American counterparts, and the seemingly endless wave of innovation coming out of the craft beer industry, to expand&mdash;or reinvigorate&mdash;their already storied beer cultures. Small European craft brewers like England&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.meantimebrewing.com/" target="_blank">Meantime</a>, Norway&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.haandbryggeriet.net/" target="_blank">Haand Bryggeriet</a> and <a href="http://www.nogne-o.com/" target="_blank">N&oslash;gne &Oslash; Brewery</a>, Scotland&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/" target="_blank">Brewdog</a>, and Italy&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.birrificio.it/" target="_blank">Birrificio Italiano</a>, to name just a few, are giving their own unique twists to traditional styles as well as creating whacked-out experimental brews.<br /><br />

And even though the U.S. craft beer industry is the most dynamic in the world at the moment, it <i>never</i> pays for an industry to exist in a wholly homogenous environment. This leads only to stagnation of both thought and invention, so both craft brewers and beer drinkers need to continually look outside our comfort zones, and, with beer, at least, many times that means looking across the oceans to breweries scattered to every corner of the Earth.<br /><br />

But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should only be interested in the newer breweries cropping up in Europe and beyond. There is still value&mdash;great value&mdash;in looking at the offerings from the great historical brewers in England, Germany, and Belgium. One, because a lot of these beers are still some of the best in the world, as well as being the blueprints for the majority of the world&rsquo;s great beer styles. And two, because it is important to keep classic but dying (at least outside of the U.S.) styles alive and forever in our consciousness. Rauchbiers, lambics, and other regional styles that are slowly winking out of existence in Europe could become the next great beers of the U.S.&mdash;or maybe just the Midwest&mdash;craft beer movement. 1 0 1 2009-02-02 1 1 1 0
103 Fire, Revisited&nbsp;&hellip; Again Before we close the door on the theory that the Autumnal Fire recipe has been cranked, or even tweaked, let&rsquo;s hear it from the horse&rsquo;s patoot. So upon publishing the article <a href="/articles.php?article_id=100">Feel The Fire</a>, in which <a href="/contact_us.php?user_id=7">Jug</a> and I tasted side by side by side by side the last four vintages of Capital Brewery&rsquo;s doppelbock masterpiece <a href="/reviews.php?id=102">Autumnal Fire</a>, we got <a href="/articles.php?article_id=100#comments">several comments</a>, a couple of blog posts, and an e-mail regarding our positing. In case you didn&rsquo;t read the article, and assuming you are too lazy to do so now, let me sum things up: we decided that Capital had changed the recipe over the last four years. All the responses to the article that we saw were either neutral or in agreement to our thesis, except one: that e-mail I mentioned. That e-mail actually came from the brewmaster at Capital, Kirby Nelson. He did not agree with the theories we hatched from the results of our tasting. Not at all.<br /><br />

Kirby and I exchanged a couple of e-mails. He had is own theory: in so many words, we were full of shit. Jug and I stuck to our guns, and maintained our view that there was a huge difference between the older and the younger vintages. So we decided to get together at Kirby&rsquo;s place&mdash;Capital Brewery&mdash;and discuss things over a beer.<br /><br />

We ducked into the small offices just off the brewery&rsquo;s Bier Stube, and introduced ourselves to Kirby. Right off the bat, he, and several other folks working in the brewhouse at Capital, forcefully assured us that the recipe was exactly the same it had been the first time Kirby brewed it at the <a href="http://greatdanepub.com/" target="_blank">Great Dane</a> in 1997. He seemed more than a little ticked off about our assumptions. Which, to be honest, he had every right to be. Although we never accused Capital of doing anything wrong&mdash;it&rsquo;s perfectly fine for a brewery to change its recipe&mdash;we should have given him a chance to refute our claims before we published them.<br /><br />

<div class="pullquote">
Although we never accused Capital of doing anything wrong we should have given them a chance to refute our claims before we published them.
</div>

That was a mistake we shouldn&rsquo;t have made. Even discounting that, Jug and I believed him. Perhaps we&rsquo;re naive, but we&rsquo;re going to assume a person we talk to wouldn&rsquo;t lie to our faces. Unless we&rsquo;re proven wrong with that person, we&rsquo;re going to stick to that assumption. After Kirby offered us a couple of pints of <a href="/reviews.php?id=100">Blonde Doppelbock</a> right out of the fermentation tank, we sat down to discuss it further. Despite Kirby and company&rsquo;s assertions&mdash;and the unbelievably delicious, ultra-fresh Blonde&mdash;we still maintained there was an easily noticeable difference between the different years of Autumnal Fire that simple aging and oxidation couldn&rsquo;t explain. So we asked what could have caused these changes, other than a change to the actual recipe. He had several reasons, the first being the differences in malt from year to year, batch to batch.<br /><br />

Which made sense, once he pointed it out. See, Capital doesn&rsquo;t malt its own barley. In fact, it is the incredibly rare commercial brewery that does. The only ones I can think of off the top of my head are the big ones, Anheuser-Busch or InBev, or whatever the fuck they called themselves now, and their behemoth ilk. And even then the maltings are in specialized facilities separate from where the beer is brewed.<br /><br />

And malting is still far more an art than a science. A very basic recap of what malt is: barley is allowed to germinate, during which it converts stored energy into easily accessible sugar. The maltster then quickly heats the germinated barley, a process known as <i>kilning</i>, to stop germination. This allows the brewer to harvest the barley&rsquo;s sugars in the <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=mash&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">mash</a> with which to make beer.<br /><br />

<div class="pullquote">
The vast majority of a beer&rsquo;s flavor&mdash;except for maybe unbalanced IPAs&mdash;comes from the malt.
</div>

The vast majority of a beer&rsquo;s flavor&mdash;except for maybe unbalanced IPAs&mdash;comes from the malt. And the intensity of the flavor from the malt depends on the degree and intensity to which the malt is kilned. Darker, roasted malts convey those roasty-toasty flavors you get in porters and stouts, while lightly kilned malts sport subtler flavors in brews such as pale ales and pilsners. But there is no laser gun you can point at malt as it kilns that says, &ldquo;This is X degress <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=Lovibond&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">Lovibond</a>.&rdquo; No, it&rsquo;s up to the individual maltster to decide what constitutes the adequate kilning of different degrees of malt. Like I said, far more art than science. The same, say, chocolate malt from different maltings may be quite different in flavor and even color. Not to mention what barley was used, where it was grown, and what the weather was like during its growing season.<br /><br />

So, that explanation alone made a lot of sense, especially if you consider how much malt would be in a brew with an <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=original gravity&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">original gravity</a> as high as Autumnal Fire has&mdash;1.08-plus. And, when we pointed out the exact vintages where our samples diverged, Kirby said they had made some changes/repairs/upgrades during that time period to their kettles that could account for changes in the final product. (I admit I got a little lost during this explanation. If you&rsquo;ve ever conversed with Kirby, you&rsquo;ll know that he takes a lot of detours while he&rsquo;s talking. &ldquo;I tend to go off on tangents,&rdquo; he said, interrupting a tangent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hobby of mine.&rdquo;) Even though the kettle explanation was over my head, Jug said it made sense to him, and his brewing knowledge eclipses mine tenfold.<br /><br />

So, let&rsquo;s set down some definitive answers in digital ink here:<br /><br />

Q: Has the Autumnal Fire recipe been cranked, or even tweaked?<br /><br />

A: No.<br /><br />

Q: Does Autumnal Fire seem different from year to year?<br /><br />

A: Yes. And this is a categorical yes, because there is no way I or Jug can be convinced that Autumnal Fire does not taste different now than it did three, four, five years ago. My memory swears up and down to me that it was a much more intense, challenging beer than it is now. But, these differences are from changes not directly related to the actual recipe. A number of factors could explain even seemingly obvious differences from year to year. In fact, Kirby himself said he&rsquo;s not all that troubled by said differences, as long as he&rsquo;s happy with the batch he&rsquo;s just finished brewing. And as I stated in my very <a href="/articles.php?article_id=52">first Autumnal Fire article</a> over a year ago, I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with that.<br /><br />

<div class="pullquote">
As long as craft brewers continue to strive to create great beer, we&rsquo;ll be in their corner.
</div>

Q: Is Autumnal Fire better or worse in the last couple of years than previous ones?<br /><br />

A: That is for the individual drinker to decide. I like my Fire darker, maltier, and generally bigger. But in my opinion Autumnal Fire is still a <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=370">phenomenally great beer</a>. Others I&rsquo;ve talked to said they&rsquo;ve also noticed a difference from past years, but actually like the newer incarnation better.<br /><br />

Q: You guys make monkeys seem more intelligent in comparison. Or at least better smelling.<br /><br />

A: That isn&rsquo;t a question, but&nbsp;&hellip; we&rsquo;ll get back to you on that one.<br /><br />

Although it was a blast drinking Blonde Doppelbock (and, later, Maibock) right out of the tank and shooting the shit with Kirby, the whole point of the endeavor was to set the record straight. The reason for the existence of BeerDorks.com other than the aggrandizement of my and <a href="/contact_us.php?user_id=5">Nigel</a>&lsquo;s ego is to celebrate and promote Midwest craft beer, which we think is some of the best in the world. Which means we want Midwest brewers&mdash;like Capital&mdash;to continue to brew great beer and thrive while doing so. We won&rsquo;t agree with the methods to their madness 100 percent of the time, and if we think they've done wrong, we won't be afraid to tell them so, but as long as they continue to strive to create great beer, we&rsquo;ll be in their corner. 1 0 1 2009-02-09 1 1 1 0
104 Grab A Foreigner&mdash;Beer, That Is Get out there and try an international brew, but remember: freshness counts. We&rsquo;re halfway through International Month here at BeerDorks.com and we&rsquo;ve touched on a handful of some great and/or well-known foreign-brewed beers. To wit:<br /><br />

Jug reviewed <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=402">The Lion Brewery Ceylon PLC Lion Stout</a> and <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?rev_id=400">Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout</a>.<br /><br />

Nigel reviewed Jamaica&rsquo;s national brew, <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=404">Red Stripe</a>, and has a few more coming down the pike.<br /><br />

I&rsquo;ve reviewed <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=403">Private Weissbierbrauerei G. Schneider & Sohn Aventinus</a>, <a href="http://beerdorks.com/reviews.php?rev_id=399">Brouwerij Moortgat Duvel</a>, and <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=406">Uerige DoppelSticke</a>.<br /><br />

Hopefully we&rsquo;ve inspired more than a few of you to go out and try some brews from across the world. But before you go out all willy-nilly to your nearest liquor store or bar and start ordering everything from all over the globe, we&rsquo;ll share a few pointers with you when it comes to seeking out and buying international beers.<br /><br />

It&rsquo;s not something you hear a lot about, but over time beer can go bad, sometimes&mdash;if you&rsquo;re really unlucky&mdash;in a couple of months. What happens is a process called <i>oxidation</i>, where oxygen reacts with molecules in beer and begins to produce off flavors, like notes of wet cardboard, wineyness, rotten vegetables, and even&mdash;blech&mdash;baby diapers (as opposed to adult diapers, I suppose). Most often you&rsquo;re going to notice this in lighter, more subtle beer styles&mdash;darker, heavier beers like stouts and old ales can stand up to aging, and sometimes even improve over time. But if you&rsquo;re going to buy a four dollar bottle of German <i>weissbier</i> at the local beer shop, you want to make sure it&rsquo;s not skunked to high heaven.<br /><br />

One way to help avoid buying bad brew is checking for a date on the bottle. American craft brewers have been woefully slow to adopt this consumer-friendly feature, mainly because the cost to do so is prohibitive, especially for the smaller producers. But a lot of the international breweries are huge, on a scale more akin to macro swillmakers than craft brewers. Despite their size, however, many of these established foreign breweries&mdash;some are hundreds of years old&mdash;are making interesting, even challenging beers. And because of their scale of operations, they can afford to date their bottles. This is important to us, because sometimes foreign brews can sit on the shelf at your local beer store for a long time before curious beer dorks pick them up&mdash;not to mention the fact that these same brews might have been sitting on a ship outside of some port for months on end.<br /><br />

So, check the date. Some breweries, like Brouwerij Moortgat, the makers of <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=399">Duvel</a>, print a &ldquo;best before&rdquo; date somewhere on the label, usually on the back or the neck. Others print the date the beer was bottled, which leaves you to guess how long is too long. There&rsquo;s no scientifically determined expiration date for beer, but there&rsquo;re a few rules of thumb. Lighter brews go skunky quicker, so if you&rsquo;re picking out something especially delicate, like a Weihenstephaner Kristall Weissbier, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure it&rsquo;s no more than six months old. Nine months you&rsquo;re getting into extremely iffy territory, and a year, well, you&rsquo;ve been warned. Slightly heavier brews like pilseners, pale ales, and bigger wheat beers may be good for a few months longer. Doppelbocks, porters, stouts, these will still be drinkable even after a year, sometimes even <i>two</i>, since they were brewed. Just be aware that a fresh Aventinus is going to taste quite a bit different than a bottle two years old. It might not necessarily be <i>bad</i>, but it&rsquo;ll be different.<br /><br />

Also, be aware that the first thing to go in an aging beer is the hops&mdash;the sharper edges of the flavors, aromas, bitterness. So that crisp German pilsener might not be all it could be after a year since it was bottled all the way over in Europe.<br /><br />

Mileage may vary: I&rsquo;ve had Bavarian wheats that&rsquo;d been in the bottle for a year and a half and tasted fine, and I&rsquo;ve had pale ales barely six months old that tasted like an old shoe box. Sometimes it boils down to dumb luck. So the main thing to keep in mind is to grab the freshest bottle you can find, especially if it&rsquo;s a lighter brew or the hops are the star of the show.<br /><br />

So get out there and try some of the brews we recommended that may appeal to you, or feel dangerous and just grab something that intrigues you off the shelf. Drink, taste, <i>think</i>, compare to some of the similar brews you&rsquo;ve had here in the Midwest. You might very well be sampling a piece of American craft brewing&rsquo;s past. Or maybe it&rsquo;s future. 1 0 1 2009-02-17 1 1 1 0

8 8 Nigel nigel@beerdorks.com Great article, couldn't agree more with your commentary.  I actually know a guy who used to order Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss with OLIVES!! What a douche!  Keep fighting the good fight Eddie. article 2006-12-03 00:08:02 64.12.116.70

10 10 Tom Ciula grynder33@aol.com After the wonderful Brewers gone Wild brews this year, I dont know how you cannot include Tyranena of Wisconsin article 2006-12-20 05:52:28 205.188.117.13
11 10 Sopor http://beeradvocate.com/user/profile/sopor Well Eddie, I like my beer very much the same as you. Alpha King, Two-Hearted Ale, Crooked Tree are some of my top 10 favs. However, there's no way a brewery as one-dimensional as Three Floyds should be the #1 brewer in the Great Lakes/Midwest. All their beers are loaded down with hops. Which is fine for my personal preference, but not for the title of "Best Brewery" in the midwest!<br /><br />Founders, Bell's, Great Lakes, then New Holland. article 2006-12-20 09:41:13 12.150.63.130
17 10 Nigel nigel@beerdorks.com I have to disagree with Frederick. Despite being a good brewery with a great location and decent distribution (and a phenomenal tour), I think most Lakefront brews fall short in terms of overall quality when compared to other Midwest craft breweries.  It's a solid brewery, but definitely not top 10 with all the other fine brewers in the region article 2006-12-21 00:50:27 64.12.116.70
13 10 Adam asdf@asdf.com I think a criteria you're missing is value.  Which breweries really make you pay for the good stuff, and which ones keep their big beers in line (~2x per oz) as the 'normal' beers.  IMO, this bumps up Bell's, Capital, Summit while dropping  3F, GI Fnd article 2006-12-20 11:15:24 129.188.69.169
14 10 Z zrmckidwell@sbcglobal.net I agree with sopor. Three Floyds is too one dimensional to be best. Innovation requires variety, I think. You deducted points from Sprecher for innovation. Great Lakes, Capital then....well we all have our ideas. article 2006-12-20 16:57:30 68.74.223.7
15 10 Nigel nigel@beerdorks.com While I would only make minor adjustments to your top 10, I agree that Tyranena is a major omission- its easily better than at least 2 or 3 that made your list article 2006-12-20 20:20:13 152.163.101.14
16 10 Frederick clarkf@uwplatt.edu I think sorrowfully missing here is the lakefront brewery.  Also, while New Glarus loses on distribution; that is part of what makes it great.  It's not available everywhere which makes it special when you unexpectedly find it. article 2006-12-20 21:42:45 69.179.12.192

295 71 astrochick Wait...New Glarus produces more barrels than Great Lakes or Capital? Then how come they "can't keep up" and distribute outside WI?

297 71 Eddie Glick It?s not about being able to keep up. It?s about quality control?they want to be as close to the drinkers of their product as possible.<br /><br />Don?t believe me?

298 71 Nigel nigel@beerdorks.com I have to agree... as much as Sam Adam's is heavily marketed and distributed, they still deserve respect as a pioneer in the craft beer movement and a creative force with beers like Utopia, etc.  They ARE a craft brewer, albeit the largest one in the country... you can't downgrade them for being successful. article 2008-04-10 00:35:33 24.167.255.27 Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
299 71 ade solomon randy.odonnell@comcast.net Sam Adams is no craft.  My test is when at the tap.  When Sam Adams is so available that I'm looking for "what else" is on tap, that's the threshold.  Sorry Sam Adams Lager isn't raising an eyebrow. article 2008-04-10 01:18:47 76.115.45.7 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/523.12.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0.4 Safari/523.12.2
300 71 Nigel nigel@beerdorks.com Just because Sam Adams is all over the damn place and they have some brews that aren't that great doesn't make them any less "craft".  There are plenty of small craft brewers out there that make absolute shit.  Look at New Glarus... great brewery, but their big beer is Spotted Cow, which is pretty awful.  And the fact that they brew at a number of locations?? Totally meaningless... if you only have so much room at one location, you have no choice but to find another in order to meet demand.  That doesn't mean the beer produced at the other location is somehow lacking in quality. article 2008-04-10 01:33:06 24.167.255.27 Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
301 71 EddieGlick I agree ubiquity doesn?t rule out a beer being consider ?craft brewed.? But what if Sam Adams was brewed in Peru, at a factory Jim Koch had never been to, run by staff he?s never physically met. Would it still be a craft beer? Just because it?s got the Sam Adams logo and uses the Sam Adams recipe? article 2008-04-10 12:09:14 38.115.182.4 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10_4_11; en) AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1 Safari/525.13

1 2 2 MacTarnahan's is the flagship beer of the former Portland Brewing Company and is a staple in the Portland brewing scene, but this Beer Dork leaves it rather than takes it.  In the land of elite ambers, MacTarnahan's comes in a little tinny and without a signature that keeps it a tier below the likes of Alaskan, New Belgium&#146;s Fat Tire, and the unparalleled Mac and Jack&#146;s African.<br /><br />While MacTarnahan&#146;s will flourish due to locals&#146; loyalty to the PBC, if you make your way to the tap room, do yourself a favor and take advantage of the additions found due to the Pyramid influence&#151;try their respectable Hefeweizen and tasty Snow Cap. 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 2006-01-22 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
2 1 4 Although the wack jobs at Three Floyds don't come out and say it, what we have here is a bona fide wheat IPA. It pours pale and cloudy like any true bottle-conditioned wheat brew should, with a decent head. Now imagine this: a whiff&#8212;just a whiff, mind you&#8212;of the sweet cloves you'd expect from an American wheat, followed by a torrent of hop aroma. The sippin' is the same: light, refreshing, with a hint of fruitiness, followed by enough bittering hops to smack your ass and call you Sally. Plus the bottle sports a cig-smoking, bad-ass cat, the titular hero of the Gumballhead the Cat comic series. Here's to hoping that the gang at Three Floyds keeps oversampling their own wares. 1 0 7 0 1 0 0 2006-02-21 0000-00-00 2016-09-10 22:42:46
3 3 2 A whiff of watermelon excites your palate as you take a sip of this wheat beer&nbsp;&#8230; only to find that it doesn&rsquo;t really have a watermelon taste at all. This fruit beer lover was disappointed by the hype around this brew, although the wheat beer itself was nicely golden and light on the hops, making it a decent option for the drinker who wants a fruit beer without it tasting too fruity. 21st Amendment claims to put up to 500 pounds of watermelon in each batch. Maybe next time they should think about adding 1000. 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 2006-08-07 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
7 4 3 Harbor City Brewing in Port Washington, Wisconsin puts out some solid if unspectacular beers. Keeping squarely in that vein is their Mile Rock Amber Ale, a drinkable but ultimately unremarkable American Amber.<br /><br />It pours a light amber, almost too light, maybe closer to a pale ale than you'd like. My pour sported a very nice head, though, which hung around throughout the drink.<br /><br />I like my ambers maltier than a sumbitch, but my nose wasn't in for any pleasant surprises. There was a hint of that wonderful old-school sweetness, but it plays second fiddle to some of the strong yeastiness you normally get from dryer alts/ambers/reds.<br /><br />Tastewise, the road didn't fork any. Not nearly as malty as I yearned for, but that aforementioned resilient head kept things interesting. Instead of that sweet backwash we all dream about, I got a mild but distinct tinny aftertaste, more than a little reminiscent of a Fat Tire (take or leave that as a compliment as you see fit).<br /><br />But I'm not saying this ain't a drinkable ale. Just don't get set for the ride of your life. It's lighter in body than most others of its ilk, so you could easily sit at your favorite bar and down a sextet of these without having to do windsprints in between. And, no, the earth won't have moved, but you won't have much of a rue on, either, afterward. So what the Hell. Give it a try. 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 2006-08-17 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
8 5 3 In Wisconsin there are 72 people who care enough about the ladies to offer them a tasty fruit beer.  Im talking about the folks from Chippewa Falls who have created Leinies Berry Weiss, a smooth offering made with honey and blackberry juice (they claim this is a blend of blackberries, elderberries and loganberries, but the actual label says, juice).   Its now available year-round, should you need to drink away any winter blues with the taste of summer.<br /><br />This dark pour provides a fresh taste, but its almost too sweet owing to the fact that it is made with juice and not real fruit.  If you drink one, youll have enjoyed a refreshing beverage.  If you drink more than one, the sweetness becomes cloying and youll start to burp.  A lot.  And that is decidedly unladylike.<p style=\"display:none;\"><a href=\"http://www.duangwatch.net/category/bell-ross-watches-replica/\">Replica Bell & Ross Watches</a></p><br /> 3 0 2 1 1 0 0 2006-09-16 0000-00-00 2016-09-29 01:59:20
9 6 4 Founders Brewing Company set out to create a summer taste that&#146;s different than all the rest, and they&#146;ve succeeded in their Rubaeus, a dark, colorful wheat beer made with fresh raspberries that are added during five different stages of the fermentation process.  Founders went the extra mile to achieve a nice balance between the malt and the fruit, and the result is a deliciously tart beer that has a full berry flavor without being overly sweet.  If you like a raspberry-flavored beer whose tartness nips at your taste buds rather than slams them with tang, reach for this refreshing brew.  And even if you don&#146;t like fruit beer, I&#146;d recommend trying this one when you crave summer refreshment. 3 0 3 0 1 0 0 2006-09-16 0000-00-00 2014-07-18 22:12:13
10 7 4 If you need to get some attention, just order this bright pink beer and watch the people flock to it.  The obvious pink hue is a signal that this quaff is heavy on the fruit, and if you&#146;re looking for full-bodied fruitness, look no further.  Raccoon Lodge adds whole raspberries to a sour mash Berlin-style wheat beer, and the effect is incredible.  You don&#146;t just taste raspberries, you taste the roundness and plumpness of them as well, and the tart sensation on the palate would make you swear you&#146;ve just had your fill of real berries.   In fact, this beer may very well provide you with one USDA recommended daily serving of fruit!  <br /><br />Ladies, drop the cosmo and order one of these the next time you&#146;re looking for a good girly drink.  The hangover won&#146;t be nearly as deadly the day after. 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 2006-09-16 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
11 8 4 This Betty is a bad, bad girl!  Colorado&#146;s first microbrewery creates an unfiltered, cloudy Bavarian-style wheat for their summer seasonal.  Betty seduces you with subtle hints of banana and clove, but what really makes her special are the Hallertau hops that help give her a champagne-like sparkle on your initial meeting and a sassy finish on the back end.  Betty is game for hot weather, barbecues, hanging out in beer gardens, and long walks on the beach.  You&#146;ve got to get to know her quickly though, because once you introduce her to all your friends, everyone will want a piece of her. 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 2006-09-16 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
12 9 3 If you're afraid to jump into the world of microbrews, start with Leinenkugel's. They produce good solid beers that aren't overly complex, but they're a hell of a lot better than that swillwater called Budweiser.<br /><br />Leinie's Sunset Wheat is a perfect example. It's a sunny American wheat with a good cloudy--but not overly so--appearance that is a touch darker than many wheats. It also doesn't have the typical banana notes; rather, it has a slight citrus character. The smooth, creamy aroma perfectly mirrors the smooth, creamy taste. A slight bite on the finish nicely rounds out this refreshing brew.<br /><br />Next time you're looking for a good wheat beer that doesn't taste really fruity, grab a Sunset Wheat. You won't be sorry. 3 0 0 3 1 0 0 2006-09-26 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
13 10 5 After his suicide, the Flying Dog Brewery wanted to create a beer to honor Dr. Hunter S. Thompson. The result was the Gonzo Imperial Porter, a beer that anyone who likes good beer would be honored to have made in his or her honor.<br /><br />Gonzo Imperial Porter has a rich, dark chocolately sweetness that fills the palate with every drink. The sweetness is never overwhelming, and there is a strong bitterness to the aftertaste to remind you that this is a serious beer.<br /><br />With its high alcohol content, it is likely to help any writer live up to the gonzo spirit. But that is part of what makes it good.<br /><br />Keeping with the theme, the packaging is illustrated by artist Ralph Steadman, who did the drawings for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Curse of Lono, and other Thompson works.<br /><br />The Flying Dog Web site says this is only made in small batches, so you should grab it when you see it. I don&#146;t know if this is a marketing ploy or not, but when you see a four-pack of Gonzo Imperial Porter on the shelf, definitely grab it. It will be worth every sip. 4 0 1 2 1 0 0 2006-09-26 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
99 420 4 I may sound like a broken record, but damn am I glad for the warm weather.  The only problem is craft beer isn&#146;t the best type of drink in the heat.  With the weather getting warmer in the next couple months, flavored malt beverages are the most refreshing.  Now I am not saying that I like flavored malt beverages.  They are the best when drank in the heat of summer when golfing or doing any other physical activity outside that requires something quenching. <br /><br />To get back on track I picked another one of the beers that Tyranena produce.  So here I am in the coolest room in the house reviewing The Devil Made Me Do It Imperial Coffee Oatmeal Porter.  This is just one of the few brews of the Brewers Gone Wild series that is produced seasonally.  It may sound like a mouthful but every word in the title of this beer is true.  The pour from the bottle is silky smooth, almost syrup-like, with a dark chocolate color to it.  There is not much complexity to the aroma; just imagine taking a handful of freshly roasted coffee beans mixed with heavily roasted barley and sniffing this in the palm of your hand.  There is no notice of hop aroma, but these styles of beer can go either way and still be good.  The taste is just as I imagined it would be upon smelling it; heavily malted coffee flavor that is all perfectly balanced with a little sweetness and smoothness.  With this being an imperial porter I thought it would have a strong alcoholic taste but was pleasantly surprised to find out it didn&#146;t.  I must say, this being a beer brewed with actual coffee beans, they have done a good job of balancing everything out.  <br /><br />This just might be the last dark beer I do before it really starts getting hot, unless something really catches my eye or we get pounded with another batch of cold weather and I would need a heavy hitter to keep me happy.  But deep down inside I&#146;m pretty sure that won&#146;t happen.  The main reason for going cold turkey has to do with all the winter weight put on during the past season.  It may seem hard to imagine unless you have the best metabolism in the world, but a large population of Midwesterners have this problem.  Some of population never loses this, which contributes to our ever-growing problem with obesity in the United States.  So yours truly has to start losing some of the winter weight and not become part of the fatty-of-the-month club.  Either way you can count on me reviewing sweeter session style craft brews in the near future.     <br /><br />Prosit 8 0 3 1 1 0 0 2007-05-10 0000-00-00 2013-03-24 22:01:57
100 421 3 Sprecher&#146;s Mbege is a specialty brew based on mbege ale, a beer native to northern and eastern Africa. Traditionally it is brewed with bananas, millet (a small, round grain that puts up with heat and drought moreso than barley, making it an ideal grain for some parts of Africa) and quinine, a bittering and flavoring agent (in other words, a rough and not very efficient substitute for hops) extracted from the bark of quinine trees that is more commonly used to make tonic water. Other than the bananas, the folks at Sprecher haven&#146;t let on how authentic the rest of their Mbege ingredients are. And since my parents won&#146;t lend me the money to have a chemist analyze the beer&#146;s makeup, the only thing <i>I</i> can do is pop the top and sample this funky brew.<br /><br />The beer slides out of the bottle a cloudy dark yellow&#151;yep, it&#146;s unfiltered. A medium, fizzy head dissolves quickly into a thin, extremely fine beaded topping of white. OK, the brewers claim this beer is brewed with fresh bananas, so you&#146;d assume there&#146;d be some scent of bananas in the nose. This ain&#146;t just a <i>scent</i>, folks. This is a lock-up-your-monkeys, balls-out, head-rush banana torrent. You know how most people describe a good Bavarian-style hefe as &#147;bananas and cloves&#148;? Start thinking up a new description. Because those beers ain&#146;t got nothing on the Mbege, banana-wise, at least.<br /><br />So, yes: <i>BANANAS!</i></b>. That&#146;s what the nose is, with a blunted aroma of mint in the background. The taste is similar but less so. Just <i>bananas</i>. Mixed with a generic taste of berries, with a touch of sugary sweetness. Something reminiscent of a banana-and-berry cream soda. The end&#146;s got a tiny bit of tinniness, but nothing overly unpleasant. Body-wise this is a light, light beer, with a very sharp, crisp mouthfeel. I could see drinking this during a hot, muggy Midwestern afternoon. Just make sure you like the long, yellow, peeling-kind fruit, because I was belchin&#146; bananas for the rest of the night. 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 2007-04-11 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
101 422 4 Indigenous to southern and western parts of Africa, Shakparo is one of Sprecher&#146;s offerings in their African-style beer series. Weighing in at 5.7% ABV, it&#146;s brewed with sorghum, an <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=adjunct&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">adjunct</a> that&#146;s seeing a rapid rise in popularity among craft brewers interested in producing gluten-free brews. Because sorghum is, technically, a grain, alcoholic beverages made from it are, indeed, beer, even though sorghum more resembles sugarcane in how it is processed for food&#151;normally, juice is extracted from the stalk and refined through boiling. A shakparo-style beer, though, is made from malted kernels of the plant.<br /><br />Sprecher&#146;s take on the shakparo pours an extremely cloudy orange gold. It sports a decent head that fritters quickly away into a super-fine mesh of bubbles. The aroma is a strong scent of bananas and cloves, a dead ringer for a Bavarian-style hefeweizen&#151;at first. As the beer warms, its complex nose comes out to play: dried, cut grass and a buttery aroma along the lines of movie theatre popcorn. Interesting. This brew&#146;s got a super-soft mouthfeel, and is smooth and crisp on the tongue. There is a tiny hint of bitterness, maybe or maybe not from hops, but it&#146;s <i>way</i> in the background. There is some maltiness, too, but the esters completely dominate. If I hadn&#146;t poured the beer myself, I would swear that this was a very good hefe.<br /><br />Which makes sense, I guess, since wheat beers are traditional summer drinks, and I doubt there are much hotter summers than you&#146;d have in Africa (which is winter up here in the northern hemisphere, where the toilets flush the other way around, or at least that&#146;s what cartoons and <i>X-Files</i> reruns tell me). 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 2007-04-11 0000-00-00 2011-11-17 22:43:00
102 423 3 Sigh.  I must begin with an apology to my fellow Beer Dorks, which is not easy for my conceited English ass.  Yours truly, Nigel Aloysious Tanner, has been very selfish when it comes to reviews lately.  Not only have I re-reviewed two of Eddie's previous reviews, I've had so many new ones in the past few weeks that hardly anyone else gets their well-deserved moment in the sun as the top review.  I'm sorry- I promise to slow down (yeah, right).  <br /><br />So, why has Nigel been so busy recently writing useless drivel and passing it off as informative beer reviews?  Well, for one, I had a backstock of brews that I had been meaning to review for quite awhile, and I've finally caught up.  But that's the boring, logical answer.  The real reason is that... drumroll, please... Nigel is single again.  (I will pause here as my producer inserts the appropriate crickets chirping soundbite).  I know all of our lady Beer Dorks will be inundating Nigel's inbox with inquiries, phone numbers, and sexy pictures, but please, give me some time to grieve.  THANK GOD ITS OVER!!!  NO MORE MILLER LITE IN NIGEL'S FRIDGE!!!    <br /><br />Ok, I think I've successfully completed the grieving process.  So anyways, onward and upward here in Nigeland, and here's hoping Nigel can find a new Sugar Mama who appreciates his love of craft beer, golf, English literature, European history, and gay porn... uh... I mean, NON-gay porn.  I'd list my cell number here, but, alas, my phone doesn't work... again.  Thus, Nigel's patented rant-o'-the-day is against the cell phone companies, and I will simply say this: how the hell do you live with yourselves?  Nigel's phone, which is a whole nine months old, has just suffered the same problem for the second time in two months (my display screens, inside and out, have gone completely blank).  Nigel is quite talented, but still has a hard time using a phone when completely blind.  So, here's an anti-shout out to the worst cell phone company in the world, Cingular/AT&T, and Sony Ericsson, who makes the worst phones in the world: go f--- yourselves, you useless pricks.  Ah, that felt good!<br /><br />On to the topic at hand, Capital's Vintage Ale, an English-style Strong Ale that was introduced in limited release this past fall.  Capital Brewery is one of the finest (if not THE finest) German-style breweries in the Midwest, so crafting an English-style ale is a bit atypical of them, although it's not their first foray into the non-German world.  Capital's strength is brewing a variety of fantastic Bocks, and an English Strong Ale is somewhat similar to a powerful Bock.  The main difference?  English Ales tend to emphasize hops more than German Ales, thus making an English Strong Ale a hoppier version of a Dopplebock or Maibock.  English Strong Ales and English Bitters taste very similar, with the main difference being that, well... English Strong Ales are stronger than English Bitter Ales (duh).  Both English Strong and Bitter Ales are not nearly as hoppy as the IPA family, are far maltier and richer than any Pale Ale, and far hoppier than an English Brown Ale. Thus, they get their own special categories.  Yay for them.  The best way to compare an English Strong Ale and Bitter Ale would be to drink a Goose Island Honker's Ale and a Capital Vintage Ale back-to-back.  While both have many similar characteristics, the Vintage Ale is far more complex and flavorful than a Honker's Ale, which is an average English Bitter.<br /><br />Vintage Ale pours nicely, with just under a quarter inch of bubbly head that quickly dissipates to a slight creamy trace at the top of the glass.  A bit more carbonated than a Bock, Vintage Ale has a nice cloudy dark golden-brown color that is very similar to a Maibock in the glass.  The smell is good for the style.  Sweet caramel malt dominates, with hops noticeable.  The thing about an English Strong Ale that many find objectionable is that alcohol is usually detectable, both in the aroma and the flavor.  Vintage Ale is a good example of this, as the sweet maltiness and bitter hop smell is at times muted by that not-so-pleasant sting of alcohol.  The taste is solid.  Large amounts of sweet caramel, toffee, and molasses dominate, along with a toasted malt flavor, with a significant amount of spicy hop bitterness, and a nice fruity undertone.  Again, there is a noticeable presence of alcohol on the tongue, but the overpowering sweetness of the malt makes it tolerable.  Nice and smooth, with a medium to heavy body, this is a good beer that has the potential to be great.  Substitute the alcoholic sting with a hoppy bite, and you've got a world-class brew on your hands.<br /><br />All in all, much recommended by yours truly, Sir Nigel (4,226,485th in line for the English throne), but don't expect to be blown away, as it could be better.  Now I will rush to check my e-mail and sort through all zero messages my female fans have left me.<br /><br />Cheers! 5 0 0 0 1 0 0 2007-05-14 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
103 150 3 Great Lake&#146;s Irish ale poured a little a fairly light amber, with a thin head that dispersed after only a few seconds. The aroma was one of malt, with a hint of fruity esters in the nose. Interesting. The mouthfeel was as soft and smooth as silk, but, again, at the forefront of the sip I detected some rather strong estery flavors. The bottle&#146;s copy talked about the beer&#146;s &#147;notable toasty flavor,&#148; but the roasted malts were decidedly muted. You could, however, detect just a shot of the Conway&#146;s wopping 6.5% ABV, but it didn&#146;t make this tasty beer any harder to drink. The strong presence of esters in the nose and taste was definitely different, but it worked surprisingly well, making this a smooth, wonderfully drinkable beer. 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 2007-04-15 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
104 136 4 Goose Island&#146;s Irish ale poured a beautiful ruby color, but with virtually no head. Malty sweetness and roasted barley shared a domination of the nose, with a tiny little hop note buried underneath. True to style, it had a wonderfully soft palate, medium-bodied, bolstered by the firm presence of coffee-like roast malts. According to Goose Island, the Kilgubbin is brewed with a touch of rye, but I have to admit I couldn&#146;t detect it, and would never have guessed it was there if I hadn&#146;t been told. I was caught a bit off guard by how good this beer was, and with its relatively low ABV (4.5%), you should feel free to sit down and drink a few of these while you enjoy the rugby match. 1 0 2 0 1 1 0 2007-04-15 0000-00-00 2011-03-30 19:01:08
105 135 4 My take on Goose Island's 312 is a little different from Franz'.  See, I don't think of this as a weissbier, as much as I think it's an American wheat ale.  Therefore I don't expect to have the clove and banana notes typically found in the German styles.<br /><br />On this point, the 312 Urban Wheat does not disappoint.  It smells fresh, has a decent-sized head, and goes down smoothly.  What I did expect to see (and even Goose Island touts this on their <a href="http://gooseisland.com/beers/beers.asp">website</a>  was a little cloudiness because it's unfiltered.  However, the several 312's I've had have all been pretty clear, so I chalk that up to the fact that <i>maybe</i>, just maybe, the 312 is trying to look all urban and sleek, like a stainless steel/granite countertop kitchen.<br /><br />I don't think I'd mind a little more cloud in my 312 because it might lend to a little more flavor on the taste.  In the mouth, it's a clean taste with a slight sweetness to it and a bit of bite that reminds you you're still drinking a microbrew.<br /><br />Overall, I think the 312 is a beer that's not going to let you down.  It may not be the best thing out there, but I feel it's a bit better than average (I'd really give it 3.5 mugs).  If you need a go-to, fail-safe American wheat that won't disappoint a crowd, 312 fits the bill nicely. 3 0 2 3 1 1 0 2007-05-20 0000-00-00 2011-03-30 19:01:08
106 148 4 This spring, Baby-Boy and I were slammed to the ground with ferocious colds that prevented us from consuming a good amount of beer.  I was determined to get back to 100% health in time for summer beer season, which is my forte, and I managed to do so within the last few weeks (spring allergy sinus attacks be damned too!).<br /><br />However, before we got sick, I procured some Great Lakes Dortmunder for reviewing purposes.  Unfortunately, it ended up sitting around for some time and the graphics on the box gave Baby-Boy nightmares:  Dortmunder!  Dortmunder!  It was like a bad omen, and I kept hearing it in my head and I didn't know where I got this from, and then I woke up and saw your beer in the kitchen.  Scared the shit out of me, I tell you!<br /><br />Lucky for you, drinking Dortmunder won't be as much of a nightmare.  This is a really lovely beer in many ways.  First off, it's got a reddish-gold hue that I think separates it from a good number of regular lagers.  The head is also a decent size--it's not huge by any means, but it's got some staying power.  <br /><br />Once it's in your mouth, it's got a good feel with a lot of body to it.  The taste lasts in the middle of your mouth and finishes off with a spot of pure enjoyment.  Overall, I feel it's a really interesting lager that's a little dreamy. 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 2007-05-20 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
108 73 3 Whoa... what is this strange space?  Is it?  Could it be?  Why, yes... it is!  It's the beer review section of this fine website, and Nigel has finally figured out how to use it after being in a coma for the past three weeks.  I'd like to personally thank all zero people who sent Nigel their sympathy during this trying time.  It's ok- I know Nigel as a vegetable is far less annoying than Nigel at full brain capacity (relatively speaking), so I totally understand.<br /><br />Seriously though, Nigel, like the rest of us Beer Dorks, has been very busy with other tasks that at times makes it difficult to find new craft brews to write about.  For example, the past three weeks have found Nigel trying to find a new apartment/mansion in a new city with a new job and a new Sugar Mama.  As for Eddie, the past three weeks have found him on a new (ok, perhaps slightly used) futon in his parents basement with a boatload of new porno movies (you're welcome, by the way).  The past three weeks have found Jill and Baby-Boy volunteering at a hospital in Malawi, trying to prevent Madonna and Guy Ritchie from buying- er, uh, adopting- anymore native children.  As for Franz?  Well, in addition to getting married in a few months, he's been spending many hours in his lab trying to build a car that runs on beer, thus making the cost of fuel much, much cheaper.  Finally, the coroner's report says that Jug died face down in a bathtub full of homebrew.  Deputies say it was a scratch batch gone horribly wrong, though something tells me he'll get an IPA IV and spring back to life real soon.<br /><br />So alas, here we are with a new review, and what better way to start it than with a Belgian Triple Ale from one of Milwaukee's finest, Sprecher Brewing Co.  As we know by now, Nigel loves his Belgian Ales, and I was very hopeful of this one.  Like the Barley Wine from Sprecher I reviewed a few weeks ago, this is a limited edition release in the Brewmaster's series, so yes- I spent another 15 bucks on a liter of beer.  While ya'll finish snickering, let me just say that a fine brew has no price tag... except for this one, which had a price tag that read $14.99.  While there are three more brews in this series to review, Nigel's wallet just fled to Scotland, so I'm guessing the rest of them will have to wait awhile until proper funds- and stupidity- are attained on my part.<br /><br />You may recall that Sprecher's Barley Wine received three mugs from yours truly, though it easily had the potential to go higher if aged properly.  As for Abbey Triple, well... it's barely three mugs, and has no potential of going higher.  I'm very disappointed, especially given the price, but it's not the worst beer I've ever had (Nigel went to college, after all).  It's a fair attempt at a Belgian Triple, but by no means should it be considered a "Brewmaster's Special".  Put it in a four-pack of stubby bottles and price it at $5.99, and brother, you've got yourself a decent bargain.  Put it in a liter and charge the price of a filet mignon, and, well... screw that!  Nigel has seen this in the past in the four-packs, and would damn sure like to know why the liter is supposedly so much better.<br /><br />Abbey Triple pours a light golden brown color with a thick white head on the pour that dissipates quickly into a flat brew, with only a slight white trace at the top of the glass.  There is some cloudiness along with the nice specks that accompany an unfiltered Belgian.  All in all, a nice looking brew in the glass.  The smell is very good, with a nice amount of fruitiness, dominated by banana.  Orange zest, grapefruit, and a bit of spice (typical Belgian aromas of corriander and cloves) are also detectable to a lesser extent, along with a hint of yeast.  The taste is what soured me a bit on this brew- it's not bad, but should be better.  Nice and sweet due to the fruity ingredients, Abbey Triple has a decent hop bite at the end, but not enough to rescue this from the depths of mediocrity.  A sting of alcohol is detectable which is never good in a fine Belgian, despite the high abv.  The banana, apricot, and zesty citrus flavors are tempered a bit too much by that nasty flavor, much like you experience after a shot of sugary Carribean rum.  Nigel's suggestion is to lighten up on the sweet and tart fruits, add a bit more hops, and boom- you got yourself a decent Belgian ale.  The aftertaste is far too strong for the style, and it goes down a bit too rough.  A medium-bodied brew that should be easier to drink than it is, I would have a hard time ranking this in the upper half of Belgian-style American micros.  Sprecher has the necessary innovation to make a quality Belgian Triple, and should be ashamed for putting such an average brew into the category of "Brewmaster's Series".  All in all, I'd recommend sampling it if you can find it in the stubbies, but DO NOT spend a huge amount of jack on a liter of a very average brew.  Nigel is now off to Glendale to file a formal compliant.<br /><br />Cheers! 5 0 0 0 1 0 0 2007-05-30 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
109 425 3 The first time I can to know what Bells Wheat Love Ale was all about was on their website.  This beer was an experiment conducted by Bells with five different types of wheat beer.  They start with a wheat ale (55% wheat and 45% barley malt profile) that has two types of wheat and yeast and sell it as Bells Wheat Two Ale.  The next in the series is called Bells Wheat Four Ale, which has the same ingredients as Wheat Two Ale along with two different types of wheat and yeast.  This continues until the last in the series, Wheat Eight Ale, which has eight different types of wheat and yeast.  The beer I am reviewing is a culmination of the eight types of yeast that they label as a wheatwine.  To find out specifically what they used in all their ales you can go to the website and click the tab for Wheat Project. <br /><br />This beer, or wheatwine, pours lighter then what would be expected if they used eight different types of wheat.  So I am assuming they didn&#146;t use eight types of wheat because it&#146;s not explicitly stated on the website the malt profile.  Looking at the glass I notice yeast floating throughout.  This wasn&#146;t like a normal unfiltered beer that is cloudy in appearance.  I could see the yeast suspended in the beer.  You swirl the glass and the yeast move around but do not settle out.  One can only imagine what the specific gravity of this is to keep yeast suspended in this brew.  The first sip tasted like a normal wheat ale but then the aftertaste kicked in and was quite strong.  The smell complemented what a wheat ale smells like; strong banana and clove aroma but with a strong astringency to it.  I imagined more complexity to this beer when dealing with the profiles that eight types of yeast give off.  This might be due to the fact that the above stated aromas are more overpowering then the rest and yours truly does not have a super nose to notice.    <br /><br />All in all, it&#146;s a good brew.  I would actually love to try all the Bells Wheat Project ales to notice the tastes and aromas that are contributed to the different wheat and yeasts used.  I have not been able to find any other brews of this series except this one, so if anyone knows if they still produce this series just drop me a line.  It takes great imagination to attempt something like this.  It is no wonder why most of the products produced by Bells Brewery are supreme in taste.<br /><br />Prosit 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 2007-05-31 0000-00-00 2010-02-02 08:40:38
500 684 3 We&rsquo;ve all been in that situation: in a bar without a decent beer selection (&ldquo;decent&rdquo; can mean even <i>one</i> quality craft brew) against our will. We cast desperately about the place, hoping beyond hope that there&rsquo;s a tap of locally brewed beer hidden behind the cash register or the fat guy at the end of the bar, but to no avail. So we stare up at the darkened shelf back above the bartender and try to find a semi-drinkable import out of the dusty bottles on display.<br /><br />Most of us are granted an out in this situation with probably the most ubiquitous non-shit import in America: Guinness. But the seemingly second-most stumbled-upon non-shit import is arguably tonight&rsquo;s featured beer, Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse. I&rsquo;ve seen this beer in snooty wine-centric restaurants, just-this-side-of-dirt-floor rural taverns, and the plain-old corner pub.<br /><br />Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse is a Bavarian-style wheat beer brewed by the Spaten brewery in Munich. Other than the fact that Bavarian wheats are brewed with a significant amount of wheat malt&mdash;sometimes up to, or more than, 50 percent of the grist&mdash;they&rsquo;re also brewed with a distinctive, extremely aggressive ale yeast that produces loads of esters, giving the beer strong banana- and clove-like notes in both the nose and the palate. Also, it being a <i>hefe</i>, it damn well better be bottle conditioned, because <i>hefe</i> means <i>yeast</i> in German, and calling it a hefe-weisse signifies that there&rsquo;s yeast in the bottle. The Bavarians love them their yeasty brews, and I really can&rsquo;t argue with their taste buds on this one.<br /><br />Franziskaner pours with a massively bubbled, towering head&mdash;lucky I poured it into a bulbous 22-ounce wheat beer glass&mdash;over top a super-cloudy&mdash;this is without a doubt a true <i>hefe</i>&mdash;yellow gold body. Moderate waves of bananas and bubble gum fill the front of the sniff, with yeasty maltiness in the back. As the beer warms up, some clove spiciness gets into the mix&mdash;albeit far in the background&mdash;as well.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about sipping this beer is how hard and sharp the mouthfeel is, punctuated by some crisp, but restrained, carbonation. The banana notes are firmly present but not nearly as huge as what was in the aroma. This dissipates quickly to a rather watery middle. The finish is terse, with a short, sharp hop pop on the end of the tongue. After this <i>hefe</i> warms up, dry biscuity notes fill the vacuum of that watery middle, and end up overpowering the finish, lingering with a slightly unpleasant mustiness toward the end of the glass.<br /><br />Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse is&nbsp;&hellip; a drinkable beer. It can be nice and refreshing on a hot summer day&mdash;and far more preferable to the so-called &ldquo;lawn mower&rdquo; beers, a nice way of saying &ldquo;watery swill&rdquo;&mdash;but for a Bavarian wheat beer it can be a little tepid and uninspired. I absolutely love wheat beers, and there are some incredible ones still being brewed in Germany&mdash;Schneider-Weisse and Weiheinstephaner, just to throw a couple out there&mdash;but Franziskaner ain&rsquo;t one of them. In fact, you could easily find some Midwest offerings that make a more enjoyable Bavarian-style brew than this one. Like Sprecher <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=25">Hefe Weiss</a> or New Glarus <a href="/reviews.php?id=477">Dancing Man</a>, again, just to throw a couple out there. But if you&rsquo;re stuck in beer purgatory and Guinness ain&rsquo;t an option, Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse could do&mdash;and has, at least for me&mdash;in a pinch. 1 0 4 7 1 0 0 2010-02-09 0000-00-00 2016-02-21 12:14:14
501 685 5 International Beer Month got off to a bit of a rough start for Nigel, as the BrewDog <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=498">Hardcore IPA</a> I was so looking forward to turned out to be extremely disappointing. As the &ldquo;Editor&rsquo;s Note&rdquo; indicated (we have editors?), my Hardcore was from an early batch&nbsp;&hellip; as in, batch 002. Since then, the recipe has been altered. The brew was also past its &ldquo;best by date,&rdquo; which was July of &rsquo;09, though in a powerful style like an imperial IPA that shouldn&rsquo;t lead to spoilage. While it may not have been as fresh as it should have been, it was still a bigger letdown than hearing the best golfer in the world had a thing for Denny&rsquo;s waitresses. Who needs Swedish models when we can have trailer park skanks?<br /><br />Moving on, I have another international brewer similar to BrewDog that I&rsquo;m excited to check out. Grimstad, Norway, with a population of 20,000 on the southeast coast, a mere North Sea inlet from Denmark, is home to N&oslash;gne &Oslash; Brewery. N&oslash;gne &Oslash; was founded in 2002 and has quickly emerged as an international craft beer power from their small Scandinavian home. Apparently, N&oslash;gne &Oslash; translates to &ldquo;Naked Isle&rdquo; in Norwegian/Danish, a far cry from my original translation of &ldquo;No Eggnog.&rdquo;<br /><br />There are a few reasons I compare N&oslash;gne &Oslash; to BrewDog. To begin with, they were both founded by a pair of countrymen within the past decade, in somewhat remote, small locales on the northern European coastline. But more importantly, it&rsquo;s what these breweries were able to accomplish and what sparked their growth. As impressive as some of America&rsquo;s craft beer gems are, from Stone to Bell&rsquo;s to Dogfish Head, the chance that you&rsquo;ll find them overseas is slim. However, go into any metro area in the U.S. and locate a fine beer retailer, and the chances are pretty good that you&rsquo;ll find a brew from Fraserburgh, U.K., or Grimstad, Norway. I&rsquo;m guessing not too many Scots or Norwegians have heard of New Glarus, Wisconsin or Kalamazoo, Michigan, despite the quality beer produced there.<br /><br />As I stated in my Hardcore IPA review, the coolest thing about these new European breweries is just that&nbsp;&hellip; they&rsquo;re new. Most European brewers of note have been around for at least a couple hundred years, including a good number that have been operating since the Middle Ages. Was it tradition that spawned these newer breweries? Perhaps in part, but let&rsquo;s face it&nbsp;&hellip; Norway hasn&rsquo;t ever been known as a brewing mecca (raping and pillaging possibly, but not brewing). What played a huge role is the American craft beer movement of the past two decades. The United States went from shit beer capital of the world to being on the cutting edge of ingenuity in brewing in a matter of a few years, and that helped add a new twist to Europe&rsquo;s already rich brewing culture. I&rsquo;m not trying to be the knuckleheaded American who claims everyone is copying us because we&rsquo;re awesome; I just feel the recent American takes on classic European styles has shifted back overseas, and there&rsquo;s an exciting trend taking place among European breweries, led by these newer, edgier brewers.<br /><br />As for N&oslash;gne &Oslash;, I chose their Imperial Stout for a simple reason: imperial stouts kick ass, and Scandinavian brewers should have this style perfected. The reason strong stouts are often called Russian imperials is that the style originated in Britain, where brewers created a thick, dark, powerful brew to ship to the Russian czars, who were quite fond of beer, probably due to its complete lack of potato. The brew was strong not only to warm the drinkers on a cold Russian night, but also to survive the relatively short, but very arduous North Sea trek. Thus, the imperial stout is a style familiar to Scandinavia, which surely benefited from a few English pit stops to sample the original version.<br /><br />N&oslash;gne &Oslash; Imperial Stout pours just as it should: dark as a long Scandinavian winter&rsquo;s night, with a very slight dark tan head that dissipates into a bit of sticky trace at the side. Impenetrable to light, it&rsquo;s an impressive looking brew in the glass, but then again, most imperial stouts are.<br /><br />The aroma is absolutely awesome. Initial notes are sweeter than I expected, with dark sugary notes of molasses, toffee, and rum. These are quickly joined by the roasted malt and smoky overtones that are potent in imperial stouts: toasted grains with noticeable amounts of chocolate and coffee. The initial sweetness and strong, yet not overwhelming roasted profile makes this an aromatic treat, and no hint of the 9 percent <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=ABV&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">ABV</a> ever comes through.<br /><br />As for the flavor&nbsp;&hellip; wow! This is one of the smoothest, most balanced, and incredibly flavorful brews I&rsquo;ve sampled in some time. It&rsquo;s silky smooth, more along the lines of a milk/cream stout than a 9 percent imperial. To say it&rsquo;s complex is an understatement; there&rsquo;s so many flavors coming through over the course of the session that you don&rsquo;t know which way to turn, but they all fall into sync, creating a masterful brew. Initial flavors are heavy on the dark, roasted malt, with noticeable hints of roasted grains and nuts, coffee, and cocoa. The strong cocoa/chocolate flavor provides a smooth transition into the sugary element of Imperial Stout, with huge amounts of molasses, toffee, caramel, and dark brown sugar curling the tongue, playing well with the drier, roasted malt. In the background, hints of smoke are balanced by the slightest tinges of dark fruit, as well as a noticeable addition of Columbus hops. A kiss of hops is important in an authentic Russian imperial stout, as, like India pale ales, they were added as a preservative, though not to the extreme. That touch of bitterness, however faint it may be, really adds to the complexity of an imperial stout, and N&oslash;gne &Oslash; captures that brilliantly. While there&rsquo;s a plethora of rich flavors present, they all dance in perfect harmony, making Imperial Stout a wonderfully complex and flavorful, yet approachable brew. Medium to full bodied and silky smooth on the palate, there is a mild aftertaste. Though delicious and addictive, as an imperial stout in a pricey bomber (I paid about 8 bucks for mine) this isn&rsquo;t meant to be a <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=session beer&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">session beer</a>; simply enjoy one over the course of the evening.<br /><br />Game on, baby. <a href="/articles.php?article_id=137">International Beer</a> Month is back on track for Nigel, and I&rsquo;m sure my next European venture, into Belgium&rsquo;s Abbey Notre Dame-St. Remy for Rochefort 10, will continue the upward trend. Though N&oslash;gne &Oslash; is a new player in the European market, in a few short years they&rsquo;ve put Norway on the international craft beer map. I&rsquo;m extremely impressed with Imperial Stout, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to trying more N&oslash;gne &Oslash; in the future. Check this one out for sure, as you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.<br /><br />Cheers! 5 0 2 0 1 0 0 2010-02-11 0000-00-00 2014-01-30 14:05:59
502 686 5 It&rsquo;s business time for Nigel during the Second Annual BeerDorks.com <a href="/articles.php?article_id=137">International Beer Month</a>, which is sponsored in theory by the Toyota Prius. I&rsquo;ve touched on a couple of new-school European brewers thus far, Scotland&rsquo;s <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=498">BrewDog</a> and Norway&rsquo;s <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=501">N&oslash;gne &Oslash;</a>, so for my latest, I&rsquo;m going old school. As in, 16th century old school.<br /><br />Brasserie de Rochefort, the Trappist brewery located inside the Abbey de Notre Dame de Saint R&eacute;my near Rochefort, Belgium is one of the seven official Trappist breweries in the world. Six of those breweries are in Belgium and one in The Netherlands, not far from the Belgian border. Located in the French-speaking Walloon region, the Rochefort monks have been brewing beer since 1595.<br /><br />The story of the Trappist breweries is well known. As breweries located in monasteries and brewed by monks, the production is traditional and done with great care to detail. The recipes are often ancient but incredibly complex and flavorful, and the monks use any profits made from sales of their brews to fund their respective monasteries and chapels. Of the seven registered Trappist breweries, the lone Dutch entrant, Brouwerij de Koningshoeven produces the most beer, though I have a hard time counting them as I&rsquo;m very much anti-Dutch beer. The two best known Trappist brewers, Bieres de Chimay and Brouwerij de Trappisten van Westmalle (Chimay and Westmalle for those who keep it simple), produce a large amount of beer from their Belgian monasteries. Brasserie d&rsquo;Orval produces less than half as much as Chimay and Westmalle, and Rochefort comes next, with a fraction of the production of the big guys. On the bottom end of total output comes Achel, the newbie of the group founded in 1998, and Westvleteren, widely regarded as the world&rsquo;s finest. While Achel&rsquo;s production has increased, Westvleteren continues to produce tiny amounts of beer, making it a very, very rare (and pricey) treat for any dorks lucky enough to get their hands on one.<br /><br />Rochefort is not only widely regarded as a very close second to Westvleteren in terms of quality, but it&rsquo;s also the oldest of the group. With over 400 years of brewing history behind them, it&rsquo;s no surprise that the approximately 15 monks at the abbey have their brews down to a science. Brasserie de Rochefort produces three Trappist ales: Rochefort 6, a 7.5 percent ABV Belgian dark ale which accounts for a small amount of their production; Rochefort 8, a 9.2 percent Belgian dark ale that is the most widely produced; and Rochefort 10, an 11.3 percent Belgian quadrupel ale. Not surprisingly, while all three are of exceptional quality, the brews seem to get better as they get more extreme. Though quite challenging as an 11.3 percent Belgian quad, Rochefort 10 is one of the most rewarding brews I&rsquo;ve ever had, and historical context is an added bonus for Nigel.<br /><br />Trappistes Rochefort 10 pours like your typical Trappist ale, which means it&rsquo;s quite lively due to huge amounts of yeast and bottle conditioning. A monstrous creamy head greets my official BeerDorks.com chalice, which slowly dissipates into a luxurious tan lace throughout with some stickiness on the sides. A cloudy, deep copper hue, Rochefort 10 has enough sediment in it to create a detailed map of Europe; at times it looks thick enough to cut with a knife.<br /><br />Aromas are awesome. Simply put, this smells like a beer should. A robust, yet not overpowering aroma reveals huge amounts of earthiness, surely aided by the yeast strains that make Belgian ales so wonderfully unique. Light graininess gives way to a fair amount of dark fruit, namely plum, fig, and raisin. Some sweet sugars are present as well, making for an effervescent, yet full bodied aroma, topped off with a touch of spice. Awesome.<br /><br />The flavor cements Rochefort 10&rsquo;s quest for perfection, as, like the aroma, it&rsquo;s complex yet approachable, and loaded with incredible flavor that is second to none. An underlying bready, earthy tone persists throughout, aided by the yeast strains. A smooth sugary sweetness, with hints of caramel, molasses, and toffee persists as well, providing a perfect counterbalance to the plethora of earth tones. Dark fruit continues to be a key player, as subtle notes of fig, raisin, and plum provide a robust tone that is eased slightly at times by the slightest hint of light citrus. There&rsquo;s even a very distant hop profile that helps pull everything together, while the 11.3 percent alcohol, while though at times on the palate, is largely hidden. This may be a monstrous quadrupel, but there are so many rich flavors present that it still qualifies as a smooth, rewarding drink, though one that is best savored (it took me nearly two hours to drink my 11.2 oz. bottle). The flavors change ever so slightly as the beer warms, but like most Belgian ales, it doesn&rsquo;t affect the quality; on the contrary it allows other flavors to come to the fore. Optimal serving temperature is around 50 degrees, which gives it the smoothest, richest flavor. Medium bodied, it&rsquo;s a touch darker than some Belgian ales and relatively smooth on the palate, though on occasion there is a touch of rough alcohol.<br /><br />Perfection isn&rsquo;t easy, and I have a hard time fathoming that anyone, including Westlvleteren, could top this. While I&rsquo;m always cautious to say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the best beer I&rsquo;ve ever had&rdquo; since I&rsquo;ve tried so many exceptional ones over the years, this has to be in contention for that crown. All Trappist ales are of world-class quality, but some stand out above the crowd. Rochefort 10 is definitely one of those brews, and one that absolutely has to be experienced by any lover of good beer. Pricey at anywhere from $7-10, depending on the retailer, it&rsquo;s worth it at least once just to experience the authenticity, craftsmanship, and history of a true Trappist ale.<br /> <br />Cheers! 5 0 13 0 1 0 0 2010-02-17 0000-00-00 2016-09-13 13:59:11
503 687 5 With beer euphoria still in full effect after my amazing experience with the phenomenal <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=502">Trappistes Rochefort 10</a>, I was ready to move on to the next beer on my international agenda, the non-Trappist Belgian ale Pauwel Kwak from Brouwerij Bosteels. But today, while browsing the shelves at a local purveyor of fine suds, I saw the trademark 11.2 oz. bubble bottle from Brasserie d&rsquo;Orval, which contained another authentic Trappist ale, Orval Trappist Ale (clever name). Since I was still high on Belgian yeast, I plopped down $5 in pennies and out I went with another Trappist.<br /><br />Orval is a bit of a different beast in the Trappist world (shameless plug: to see a brief rundown of Trappist ales, go to my recent review for Rochefort 10). To begin with, they only brew one beer available to the general public, the appx. 6.9 percent <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=ABV&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">ABV</a> ale I&rsquo;m about to indulge in. Their other brew, the 3.5 percent pasterbier (a weaker table beer brewed for the monks at the monastery) Petite Orval, is not distributed. Also, while producing twice as much as Rochefort and 10 times as much as Westvleteren, the two most &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Trappist brewers, Orval is still considered a bit of an outsider when compared to them and the monsters of the Trappist world, Chimay and Westmalle, and to a lesser extent Koningshoeven. Only Achel, the newbie of the group, is less widely known than Orval.<br /><br />Brasserie d&rsquo;Orval is based at the Abbey Notre-Dame d&rsquo;Orval in Villers-devant-Orval, in the Gaume region of Belgium. Like Rochefort, it&rsquo;s in the French speaking area of Belgium, further south than Rochefort in the foothills of the Ardennes, bordering France and Luxembourg. While brewing at the abbey goes back to at least the 17th century, the modern brewery opened in 1931. Modern equipment allows for decent production, so some of the tradition found at Westvleteren and, to a lesser extent, Rochefort, is missing in the machinery at Orval.<br /><br />The &ldquo;bubble bottle&rdquo; is pretty cool, though I&rsquo;m not sure as to exactly what you call the design. A drab brown, there&rsquo;s a ring on the neck identifying it as Orval, and naming the importer, with the standard U.S. government warning. Under &ldquo;Orval&rdquo; is a fish leaping out of the water with a ring in his mouth, a reference to a local legend regarding how the abbey got its name. Stamped on the back is a &ldquo;bottled on&rdquo; date, 05/06/2008 in this case, and a &ldquo;best by&rdquo; date, which is exactly five years later. As a bottle conditioned ale, the flavor and alcohol changes with time, and Orval apparently starts under 6 percent ABV and goes upwards of 7 percent, depending on when you drink it.<br /><br />Orval is also unique in the way they approach the brewing process. Trappist Ale is dry hopped between first and second fermentations, giving it three weeks to mature and giving it a slight hoppy profile. Also, Orval uses a local yeast strain that gives a bit of a different flavor when compared to other Belgian ales. We&rsquo;ll see what the results are.<br /><br />Orval Trappist Ale pours like any bottle-conditioned Belgian, with a huge creamy head that makes it impossible to pour an entire 11.2 oz. bottle into my chalice at once. The head slowly dissipates, leaving a large pillowy lace throughout with some stickiness on the sides. A stunning deep golden brown/amber hue, there&rsquo;s quite a bit of sedimentation and carbonation, making it an impressive looking brew.<br /><br />The aroma makes it clear from the get-go that this is going to be a tad bit different. The initial aroma is sweetness, but not a typical sweetness. Rather, I&rsquo;m sensing light fruitiness in the form of grape and apple, with a bit of an acidic secondary note. After a while, the <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=brett&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">brett</a> and grains begin to become more noticeable, as does a hint of spice that wasn&rsquo;t present in my Rochefort 10. A unique aroma that&rsquo;s sweet and effervescent, and overall quite enjoyable.<br /><br />The flavor is very good, as it should be. Trappist breweries gained their distinction not only because they&rsquo;re based in monasteries, but also because they brew world-class beer. Orval is no exception, as Trappist Ale is in fact unique, but also exceptionally tasty. Initial flavors are light and sweet, with hints of green grape, tart apple, and pear, with light caramel and toffee notes in the background. The Brettanomyces do in fact give it a different flavor, as the yeasty, earthy undertone is pleasant, but unlike any brew I&rsquo;ve had. The dry hopping adds the slightest touch of bitterness, and, when combined with the brett, gives it a good amount of spice. The light sweetness, spice, and carbonation tingles the tongue from beginning to end. As the beer warms, flavors change slightly, from a more yeasty, earthy profile to a sweeter, sugary profile. <!-- Only a very slight hint of alcohol comes through at times, something that&rsquo;s hard to avoid in a bottle conditioned brew. --> Light- to medium-bodied and a touch rough on the palate due to the same acidic notes and spice, Orval goes down fairly well with a mild aftertaste. <br /><br />While Orval Trappist Ale pales in comparison to the masterpiece that was Rochefort 10, it&rsquo;s nonetheless worthy of its world-class designation. Much sweeter, spicier, and a tad more acidic, Orval is in fact very distinctive among the Trappist ales. I&rsquo;m glad I gave it a shot, and, while I flirted with a four-mug designation, I have to go with a five. An excellent brew to be sure, pick one up should you see the interesting looking bottle at a retailer, and experience it for yourself.<br /><br />Cheers! 5 0 5 0 1 0 0 2010-02-22 0000-00-00 2012-05-28 18:56:47
504 688 4 Tonight&rsquo;s featured brew during this <a href="/articles.php?article_id=137">International Month</a> comes from the remotest country on planet Earth: Canada. Even after a couple of months of study, we don&rsquo;t know much about Canada. What languages they speak, what sports they play, what cheese they eat. We do, however, know of some beers they export. Most of these beers, like Labatt&rsquo;s and Molson, are complete watery shit. But a select few are goddamned divine.<br /><br />Tonight&rsquo;s brew comes from Unibroue (pronounced YOU-nuh-BREW), located in Chambly, Quebec, and owned by Sapporo (Canada&rsquo;s Sleeman bought Unibroue in 2004, and Sapporo bought Sleeman in 2006). All of their beers have a strong Belgian influence behind them, so much so that I&rsquo;ve always thought of Unibroue as a poor man&rsquo;s Chimay, and that&rsquo;s not just because their Trois Pistoles is almost a dead ringer for Chimay Blue. Then I found out Unibroue&rsquo;s head brewer, Paul Arnott, worked for 10 years at Chimay, and I felt all smug and self-satisfied.<br /><br />But enough about me. Tonight&rsquo;s brew is Don De Dieu, which translates as &ldquo;gentleman (in the aristocratic sense) of god.&rdquo; This is one of those <a href="/articles.php?article_id=101">touchstone beers</a>&mdash;I distinctly remember exactly where and vaguely when I first sipped it. The reason it stands out in my memory is because of how light&mdash;even for a Belgian-style tripel&mdash;and spritzy it was. That was nigh onto 8 years ago, and I&rsquo;ve had it only two or three times since then, so let&rsquo;s see how well my palate and my memory line up.<br /><br />It pours a glowing, <i>slightly</i> cloudy (yeah, it&rsquo;s <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=bottle conditioning&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">bottle conditioned</a>) gold underneath a big, creamy white, tight-bubbled head. A beautiful beer in the glass, one that <i>demands</i> to be poured into a tulip glass or <i>at least</i> a snifter, for Chrissakes. That will help funnel the brew&rsquo;s wonderul aroma right into your schnoz: Belgian yeastiness, an undertone of cloves, and a touch of faint malt <i>waaaaay</i> in the back.<br /><br />The sip starts with a <i>very</i> light body and flinty-hard mouthfeel. Yeasty spiciness grabs to tongue, then fades out for a middle of soft maltiness. Finish is acidic spiciness underneath some tangy citric fruitiness. Overall the flavors are relatively subdued, and early sips before the beer warms are a little underassertive and too smooth.<br /><br />Don De Dieu is an expertly executed Belgian-style tripel&mdash;the beer&rsquo;s marketing material describes it as a &ldquo;wheat tripel&rdquo;&mdash;, but a little cleaner, a little lighter, and a little less complex than <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=499">the real Belgian thing</a>. For lack of a better word, it&rsquo;s more &ldquo;drinkable.&rdquo; The only problem being tripels are actually almost <i>too</i> drinkable to begin with&mdash;mainly because of that ass-whomping <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=ABV&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">ABV</a>. And Don De Dieu is no exception, being 9 percent ABV and all. But that is it&rsquo;s sole flaw. It is still a phenomenally great beer, only barely missing living up to the great Belgian masters. If you want to drink Belgian on a budget&mdash;or just want to enjoy a crisp, drinkable 9 percent beer&mdash;grab a bomber or four pack of this beauty from the nether regions of the world.<br /><br />[Can you believe I reviewed a beer from Quebec and didn&rsquo;t make fun of the frogs even <i>once</i>?] 1 0 2 0 1 0 0 2010-02-15 0000-00-00 2013-04-28 22:19:56
505 689 5 When you buy a bottle of Celebrator Doppelbock, it comes with a white plastic goat ornament hanging around the neck. (Because, as we all know, <i>bock</i> is German for &ldquo;goat.&rdquo;) I used to keep all my plastic goats, and had quite a few of them, but for some reason or another I tossed &rsquo;em a few years ago. Which was just plain stupid. This time around I&rsquo;m going to keep collecting &rsquo;em until I get enough to decorate an entire Christmas tree with little plastic goats that say &ldquo;CELEBRATOR&rdquo; on every damn one. Assuming Ma and Slick were to someday buy a frickin&rsquo; tree&nbsp;&hellip;<br /><br />Celebrator comes from Ayinger, a brewery located in the village of Aying, about ten miles south of Munich at the foot of the Alps. The brewery was founded in 1878 (which is pretty young, for German beer standards) by the Inselkammer family, which still owns and operates it, six generations in. And Celebrator is without a doubt their most famous beer.<br /><br />The pour is deep amber out of the bottle, sitting a dark, mostly opaque sepia in the glass. The head is big, tan, and frothy, and sticks around in some way, shape, or form for the entire mugful. Unsurprisingly for a German-bred brew, not a hint of lacing can be found clinging to the sides of the glass.<br /><br />The nose isn&rsquo;t big&mdash;I have to stick my beak in there to get any of it&mdash;but it is definitely, without a doubt, malt: wafts of grainy goodness with background flickers of chocolate. And what you smell is what you get, in terms of taste: a beautiful weave of pure barley maltiness amid strands of sweet chocolate and smooth coffee. The finish has a tiny bit of bitterness to it, drying things out just enough to keep the finish from going bonkers. Even so, the finish is nice and long, yet clean and pleasant.<br /><br />Ayinger Celebrator is probably the quintessential doppel&mdash;if you were to put together a beer dictionary, you might as well slap a picture of a bottle of Celebrator (plastic goat and all) next to the entry for doppelbock. The only thing un-doppelbock about it is its <a href=\"/glossary.php?glossary_search=ABV&display=iframe\" class=\"DOMpop\">ABV</a>: 6.7 percent. Pretty low for a doppel, especially considering a lot of plain ol&rsquo; bocks and maibocks get up over 6. But that just means you&rsquo;ll be able enjoy that much more of this beer at a sitting. 1 0 10 1 1 0 0 2010-02-18 0000-00-00 2018-11-28 00:04:10
506 690 4 For my latest <a href="/articles.php?article_id=137">International Beer Month</a> stop, I&rsquo;m venturing from the Belgian Trappist breweries, all the way to, uh&nbsp;&hellip; well, Belgium. But this time, we&rsquo;re stepping away from the monasteries and into the mainstream, with Brouwerij Bosteels Pauwel Kwak.<br /><br />I touched on Bosteels last year at this time, when I reviewed one of my all-time favorite brews, <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=405">Tripel Karmeliet</a>. Tripel Karmeliet was a touchstone brew for young Nigel, one of the first authentic Belgian ales that I ever sampled. While not technically Trappist, the complexity and quality puts it on that same high level. Tripel Karmeliet was, however, the only brew that I had tried from Bosteels, a brewery that&rsquo;s been around since 1791, until recently.<br /><br />Upon a visit to a tiny local pub with a huge selection of imports, I discovered Pauwel Kwak, a beer from Bosteels that I&rsquo;d seen many times, but never tried. Given my man-crush on Tripel Karmeliet, I figured I&rsquo;d give it a shot. Granted, my first taste came after having indulged in a not-so-great Polish beer, but I was very impressed. Tripel Karmeliet? Not even close, but Pauwel Kwak, while very different, was still very good.<br /><br />Pauwel Kwak is a bit of a different beast in the Belgian world. Considered a &ldquo;Belgian Strong Ale,&rdquo; a category that is open for interpretation, it doesn&rsquo;t have the typical tongue-numbing spiciness associated with many Belgian ales. This is no tripel or abt; rather, it&rsquo;s more lager-ish, a bit darker and maltier than many popular Belgians. Named after an 18th century brewer/innkeeper (I&rsquo;m guessing his name translates to &ldquo;Paul Duck&rdquo; in English), Pauwel Kwak is the only other widely distributed brew from Bosteels (the powerful, unique Deus Brut des Flandres is the only other Bosteels brew available on a semi-mainstream basis).<br /><br />Pawel Kwak pours like a Belgian ale, with a monstrous head of a couple of inches that slowly dissipates, leaving a plentiful, creamy lace throughout the session with a bit of stickiness on the sides of the glass. A wonderful amber hue with decent carbonation and little sedimentation (unlike most Belgian beers, this appears to be filtered) it&rsquo;s a good looking brew in the glass, though unique for a Belgian ale.<br /><br />Aromas are moderate, but a bit off. It&rsquo;s somewhat acidic, with a touch too much alcohol, as well as that bland, &ldquo;normal&rdquo; beer aroma. Sugary hints, mainly in the form of caramel and brown sugar come through initially, joined by light fruit (mainly citrus, some banana) and a touch of grain. A hint of Belgian yeast gives it that &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; feel, but all in all, it smells like your average, run-of-the-mill beer.<br /><br />The flavor redeems, though this isn&rsquo;t a five-mugger by any stretch of the imagination. Tripel Karmeliet impressed, but Pauwel Kwak simply satisfies, not that that&rsquo;s a bad thing. Dominant flavors are light fruitiness (grapefruit, orange, and banana), with a good amount of sugary sweetness (caramel and toffee). As the beer warms, earthy malt begins to take hold, mostly a grassy, tepid flavor&nbsp;&hellip; not anything overly smoky or roasted. The biggest detriment, as it was in the aroma, is the presence of alcohol. An eye-opening zest hits you upside the head on occasion, which draws away from the zesty fruit, light sugar, and rich malt. For the most part, Pauwel Kwak maintains its balance, but at times it begins to challenge the palate more than it needs to. When the alcohol and stale grain takes over, it moves away from an interesting, unique Belgian ale, into the realm of a boring ol&rsquo; beer, which is a shame. Medium bodied and smooth on the palate, the high <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=ABV&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">ABV</a> (8.4 percent) and sometimes challenging drinkability makes this a one-time treat rather than a session brew.<br /><br />Overall, a good drink. While the Trappist ales, as well as big brother Tripel Karmeliet are far better than Pauwel Kwak, it&rsquo;s a decent beer. Certain unpleasant characteristics rear their ugly heads at times, but for the most part the flavor and balance drowns that out. If you&rsquo;re looking for a strong but approachable import of quality, Pauwel Kwak may be just the ticket. Available in 11.2-ounce singles or the 25.8-ounce champagne-style bottle, it&rsquo;s a definitely worth a shot.<br /><br />Cheers! 5 0 2 0 1 0 0 2010-02-23 0000-00-00 2010-02-25 11:13:38
507 691 5 With the Second Annual <a href="/articles.php?article_id=137">International Beer Month</a> winding down here at BeerDorks.com, Nigel is sprinting towards the finish. Following two early reviews for newer European craft brewers, <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=498">BrewDog</a> and <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=501">N&oslash;gne &Oslash;</a>, I spent quite a bit of time in Belgium with Trappist brewers <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=502">Rochefort</a> and <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=503">Orval</a>, followed by an old favorite, <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=506">Brouwerij Bosteels</a>. While I was hoping to expand outside of the borders of Europe with a review for Japan&rsquo;s Hitachino, that&rsquo;s not going to happen. Instead, my second to last stop will be in Germany, the home of modern brewing.<br /><br />I enjoy International Beer Month for a number of reasons. One of them is the fact that I typically drink exclusively American craft beer. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m a xenophobic beer snob, but rather that I like to support local/American breweries, and there are so many quality ones to choose from. Also, cost can be a factor, as a fine Trappist ale can run in excess of five dollars for one small bottle. As a lover of powerful styles like imperial IPAs and stouts, I&rsquo;ve discovered that many of the best options worldwide are right here in our backyard. American brews are fresher, stronger, and typically edgier when it comes to experimentation, so I often find myself passing up the international guys.<br /><br />Even when I do dabble into international brews, there are certain styles and regions I tend to go for (can anyone say Belgium?). On the flip side, there are others I avoid at all costs (Holland, Italy, Poland, and France). Surprisingly, Germany is a country I don&rsquo;t typically get excited about, despite the rich brewing history there. So why did I choose Private Weissbierbrauerei G. Schneider & Sohn, a classic German brewer specializing in wheat beers? Because Eddie Glick swears by their flagship brew, Aventinus, and I had to see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />While I recently purchased my first bottle of Aventinus, a <i>weizenstarkbier</i>, I haven&rsquo;t yet tried it. Instead, I&rsquo;m reviewing Hopfen Weisse, a collaboration brew from G. Schneider & Sohn head brewer Hans-Peter Drexler and Brooklyn Brewing chief Garrett Oliver. The story goes that due to their friendship and admiration for each other&rsquo;s product (Oliver loved Schneider&rsquo;s unique weiss beers, while Drexler loved the hops in Brooklyn&rsquo;s IPA), they came up with a &ldquo;best of both worlds&rdquo; beer. Not only is this my first stab at Schneider, but also my first taste of anything Brooklyn, as, despite their national reputation, Oliver&rsquo;s brews haven&rsquo;t made it to the Midwest as of yet.<br /><br />What Drexler and Oliver came up with was a powerful, 8.2 percent <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=ABV&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">ABV</a> weizenbock, one that is light due to the wheat and hoppy due to the, uh&nbsp;&hellip; hops. My understanding is that each brewer brewed a version in the others brewery, so while essentially the same beer, one was made by Brooklyn and the other by Schneider. How wonderfully confusing. Reflecting the collaboration, the official name of the brew is Schneider-Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse, and comes in the 500-milliliter Schneider bottle.<br /><br />Hopfen Weisse pours well, with a creamy head of just over an inch that dissipates quickly, a surprising lack of retention that does leave a decent lace. Not quite as lively as I expected, but not bad. A translucent, cloudy golden brown hue, the sedimentation gives this the look of honey in the glass. Very unique, very cool.<br /><br />Aromas are pleasant, though not overly strong. Initial scents of light, sugary malt are quickly joined by typical weiss beer notes: banana, orange zest, clove, and coriander. Hops are present in the aroma, but not overwhelmingly so. European hops native to Bavaria are the key player here, meaning they&rsquo;re much earthier, milder, and toned down than their American counterparts. Given the fact that this is a weizenbock, they play extremely well with the rest of the aromas.<br /><br />The flavor is excellent. But while the hop profile is slightly enhanced for a wheat beer, it would seem that this is mostly Schneider and little Brooklyn (that&rsquo;s not a criticism&nbsp;&hellip; it&rsquo;s likely what both brewers were aiming for). Much like the aroma, light sugary malt, while not the main player, is the first sensation. Sweet hints of caramel and toffee give a nice flavor off the bat, which is quickly joined by the earthy characteristics associated with the wheat malt and European hops. The grainy, grassy tones dominate throughout, but thanks to the sugar, it&rsquo;s a pleasant flavor. Also enhancing the flavor is a noticeable frutiness (banana and citrus) and spice (clove, slight black pepper) that gives Hopfen Weisse a complex flavor that is very approachable. Sweet and spicy, malty and hoppy, it has it all and everything comes together well. Drinkability isn&rsquo;t an issue, as despite the high ABV, there&rsquo;s no hint of alcohol and the general profile of Hopfen Weisse is smooth, clean, and not overly heavy. While the complexity of flavors, particularly the sugar and spice, may begin to weigh over time, overall this is an excellent drink that will leave you craving more.<br /><br />While I&rsquo;m absolutely convinced of the quality of Hopfen Weisse, I am a bit torn as to the rating. It&rsquo;s worthy of a five, but there&rsquo;s a voice inside my head that says it&rsquo;s not quite enough&nbsp;&hellip; a high four would be the way to go. After much deliberation (literally five seconds worth), I shooed away that little voice, as the international collaboration idea, as well as the wonderful hop profile, make this a five-mug treat. A wonderful mix of Schneider&rsquo;s brilliant weiss brews, with a touch of the new-world tricks of high ABV and amped-up ingredients, makes Hopfen Weisse a wonderfully complex, very rewarding drink that won&rsquo;t overwhelm. Reasonably priced at around $4 or $5 for a 500-milliliter bottle, I&rsquo;d highly suggest giving it a shot&nbsp;&hellip; it&rsquo;s German and American engineering at its best.<br /><br />Cheers! 5 0 1 0 1 0 0 2010-02-25 0000-00-00 2010-03-04 01:12:28
508 682 3 Normally we don&rsquo;t write reviews in response to or as an argument against others&rsquo; reviews&mdash;instead each of our reviews is a short (relatively) essay on a given beer and what we thought of it given our perspectives, knowledge, and tastes.<br /><br />The reason I&rsquo;m bringing this up is because, as it turned out, both Nigel and I bought a bomber of BrewDog Hardcore IPA in anticipation of this year&rsquo;s <a href="/articles.php?article_id=137">International Month</a>. Nigel&rsquo;s, however, was quite old, as it was <strike>over a year</strike> seven months past the bottle&rsquo;s &ldquo;best by&rdquo; date (a feature I <i>really</i> wished all breweries would adopt) and was, as far as he could tell, batch number 2. Mine, on the other hand, was still within it&rsquo;s &ldquo;best by&rdquo; date and was batch number 287. Apparently, BrewDog <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/blog-article.php?id=70" target="_blank">significantly changed the recipe</a>, as the original was conceived during the hop shortage of 2008.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ll let you read <a href="/reviews.php?rev_id=498">what Nigel thought</a> of his bottle. Here&rsquo;s what I thought of mine:<br /><br />Hardcore pours a muddy orange with a short-lived, clingy head. Huge citrus grapefruit notes blast out of the top of the glass, screaming &ldquo;Northwest hops!&rdquo;<br /><br />The front of the sip is big, sugary malt, mixed with citrusy hop flavor. A sharp fusel alcohol pang abruptly interjects, drowning everything out, before bitter, dirt-like hops tear and rip, bringing the alcoholic bite under control. The finish is long and harshly bitter.<br /><br />Although certainly hardcore, this brew&rsquo;s fusel alcohols and raw harshness at the end are a little unpleasant. The best imperial IPAs have complex interplays between the beer&rsquo;s loads of maltiness and bitterness, but Hardcore seems a little one-dimensional in comparison, maybe even a little green. While not a bad double IPA to have in the fridge, there are bigger, badder (by which I mean gooder, er, better), and hardercorer imperial IPAs right here in the States. 1 0 2 0 1 0 0 2010-02-24 0000-00-00 2010-02-24 19:13:05
509 692 3 It&rsquo;s Nigel&rsquo;s final stop during the Second Annual BeerDorks.com <a href="/articles.php?article_id=137">International Beer Month</a>, and I&rsquo;d like to say I wish there was more month so I could sample more tasty foreign brews. Then I remember that it&rsquo;s February, so I quickly change that to an emphatic &ldquo;good riddance.&rdquo; While I respect many international brewers and there are some world-class, unique offerings to be had, I still believe the U.S. dominates in quality and ingenuity, much like they just dominated the Winter Olympics (in your face, Norway!).<br /><br />For my final review, I considered a few options, including going out with a bang (not sure how I would have done that, save for finding a bottle of <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/product.php?id=46" target="_blank">Tactical Nuclear Penguin</a>). Instead, I&rsquo;m keeping it simple and going with a traditional British ale from a traditional British brewer. So, you know&nbsp;&hellip; may God save the Queen and junk.<br /><br />Samuel Smith Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire was founded in 1758. In the mid-1800s, the Smith family became proprietors, and the brewing has continued uninterrupted. While Samuel Smith&rsquo;s is easy to find just about anywhere in the world, leading one to figure it&rsquo;s adapted into a modern, macro-esque brewery, that&rsquo;s not really true. Surprisingly, Samuel Smith&rsquo;s has remained very traditional, to the point that they still utilize dray Shire horses to deliver beer around Tadcaster (can anyone say tourist gimmick?). Even the process is still somewhat traditional, using the old Yorkshire Square system, with the original 85-foot well from 1758 and a yeast strain that dates to around 1900. Cool stuff for any lover of British brewing history.<br /><br />Samuel Smith&rsquo;s products also reflect the past 300 years or so of British brewing. Most of the styles are classic ales native to the Isles, including pales, IPAs, stouts, porters, browns, and winter warmers. But these aren&rsquo;t modern, &ldquo;imperial&rdquo; versions by any stretch of the imagination. Rather, virtually all of them check in at around 5 percent <a href="/glossary.php?glossary_search=ABV&display=iframe" class="DOMpop">ABV</a>, making them excellent pub drinks, which is where Sam Smith&rsquo;s found its largest audience until recent global expansion. With the exception of a powerful barley wine, the strongest ale Samuel Smith&rsquo;s produces is Imperial Stout, which checks in at a moderate 7 percent while many other European and American brewers have them checking in at 10 percent or higher.<br /><br />India Ale is right along those lines. A mild, drinkable 5 percent ABV, this isn&rsquo;t meant to get you blotto; rather, it&rsquo;s meant for enjoying a pint or ten over the course of a dreary Yorkshire day while watching football in a local pub. While the history of the Tadcaster brewery is such that India Ale could have been an &ldquo;original&rdquo; IPA, one that was actually shipped to India during the days of the Empire, I haven&rsquo;t seen any evidence to support that as fact. Regardless, if it&rsquo;s not the real thing, it&rsquo;s a damn close interpretation, and the Union Jack spread across the bottle makes Nigel long for his youth on the old dirt farm in Essex or Sussex or Wessex or whatever the Hell -sex I&rsquo;m supposedly from.<br /><br />India Ale pours very well&nbsp;&hellip; very well indeed. A solid pour reveals a creamy, puffy head reminiscent of a beautiful British summer afternoon (read: cloudy) that settles into a persistent lace throughout the drink. A golden brown, almost coppery hue reveals some sedimentation and little in the way of bubbly carbonation. A splendid looking brew!<br /><br />The aroma is, well&nbsp;&hellip; British. It has the distinct aroma of a labradoodle after it rolled in a mud puddle. As is typical of an English IPA, it&rsquo;s an earthy aroma heavy on the sweet, caramel malt and grassy, earthy tones. While touches of sweetness and very mild hop aromas do come through, as do notes of citrus, overall it&rsquo;s a stale, timid aroma.<br /><br />The flavor is fine, but that&rsquo;s the best I can say. Perhaps a fallback beer should I find myself at a Euro pub with Heineken, Amstel, Beck&rsquo;s, Grolsch, and Stella Artois as the other taps, but not something I&rsquo;d order on its own on a regular basis. While flavors trump the stale aroma, there isn&rsquo;t much in the way of complexity going on. Initial flavors are again malty, with sugary sweetness of caramel and toffee followed quickly by the underlying tones of European hops. It&rsquo;s well known that European versions, be they English, German, or Czech in origin, are not nearly as effervescent, bitter, or floral as their American counterparts. Thus, a true English IPA isn&rsquo;t tongue-numbingly hoppy, and India Ale falls right in line with that. The British hops add to the overall earthy profile, which is only cracked at times by a noticeable hint of sweet citrus.  A balanced, tempered, by-the-books beer, it&rsquo;s a good drink, but nothing to get your knickers in a knot over. Medium-bodied, smooth on the palate, and not overly alcoholic, it&rsquo;s certainly a session beer, though it is only available in the states in mini-bomber bottles.<br /><br />Samuel Smith India Ale is truly a trip back in time, and an appropriate way to finish off International Beer Month. A classic, pleasant drink, it won&rsquo;t blow you away, but surely won&rsquo;t offend. It has historical context, and it reminds Nigel of his childhood, when he ate his Cheerios swimming in ale. If you haven&rsquo;t tried it, I&rsquo;d suggest at least giving it a shot to experience a simple, relatively authentic English IPA. Raise a pint in celebration of a fine month of international brews, and until next February&nbsp;&hellip;<br /><br />Cheers! 5 0 3 0 1 0 0 2010-02-26 0000-00-00 2010-03-08 00:37:28

1 Barley wine, Brewers, and planting my hot pepper patio garden on a spring evening.  Does it get any better? 5 2009-05-18 22:52:42
2 Summit's Horizon is a great beer, but it doesn't go all that well with pizza. 1 2009-05-27 22:13:34
3 $2 craft brews! I love all-night happy hour! 1 2009-05-28 21:56:17

7 Abita's Andygator: different, but not that great.  2 to 3 mug range and not worthy of a review at this time. 5 2009-05-29 22:46:39
8 Scotch ale bottled and stowed away in the warm room. First taste: roasty, rich, but not quite as malty as I was aiming for. 1 2009-05-30 18:49:21
