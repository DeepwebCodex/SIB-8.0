16 Crop Circle One Heals One visited Wiltshire intending to visit the Crop Circle Convention August 2006 in Marlborough, instead we decided to go crop circle hunting ourselves!  
We allowed ourselves to be led by our noses and came across three completely different circles.
We covered every area, sensing and feeling as each circle was different to the last.
All were located within a 5 mile radius from Marlborough.

The 'energy' was prominent in one that was depicted as a space ship. 
Pictured here we are sensing and observing the high levels of prana.

7 Richard/Vince - Healing Light Wow, what a fabulous picture of the healing light occuring between Richard and Vince.

This photo was taken at Merlin's Cave in Tintagel, Cornwall. 

Richard has been working with Vince on a regular basis. This photo illuminates  the energy and captures the wonderful healing vibration that has been exchanged.

Richard used myths,legends and stories to help Vince express himself, capturing the amazing power of a child's immagination.  Also, there was healing on an emotional level, helping Vince to express how he felt about himself and how life made him feel. 1120759037

9 Thornborough, Yorkshie Beltane is a Celtic word which means 'fires of Bel' (Bel was a Celtic deity). It is a fire festival that celebrates of the coming of summer and the fertility of the coming year. Celtic festivals often tied in with the needs of the community. In spring time, at the beginning of the farming calendar, everybody would be hoping for a fruitful year for their families and fields. 

Beltane rituals would often include courting, for example, young men and women collecting blossoms in the woods and lighting fires in the evening. These rituals would often lead to matches and marriages, either immediately in the coming summer or autumn.

Other festivities involved fire which was thought to cleanse, purify and increase fertility. Cattle were often passed between two fires and the properties of the flame and the smoke were seen to ensure the fertility of the herd.

Today Pagans believe that at Beltane the God (to whom the Goddess gave birth at the Winter Solstice) achieves the strength and maturity to court and become lover to the Goddess. So although what happens in the fields has lost its significance for most Pagans today, the creation of fertility is still an important issue.

Fire is still the most important element of most Beltane celebrations and there are many traditions associated with it. It is seen to have purifying qualities which cleanse and revitalise. People leap over the Beltane fire to bring good fortune, fertility (of mind, body and spirit) and happiness through the coming year. 1146583206

onehealsone - archetypes:(78)
id,name,description,featured,ihealth,sarah,diana,picture
1 Addict [b]Addict (Conspicuous Consumer, Glutton, Workaholic--see also Gambler) [/b]

Every one of us is touched by the Addict archetype. The only question is how much of our lives is consumed by it. Besides the usual suspects--drugs, alcohol, food, and sex--one can be addicted to work, sports, television, exercise, computer games, spiritual practice, negative attitudes, and the kinds of thrills that bring on adrenaline rushes. In its positive aspect, this archetype helps you recognize when an outside substance, habit, relationship, or any expression of life has more authority over your will power than does your inner spirit. Confronting addiction and breaking the hold that a pattern or substance has on you can impart great strength to your psyche. Discovering the empowerment that comes with perseverance has a life-long impact, becoming a reference point for what you are able to accomplish. In the words of one former alcoholic, "I know now that if I can quit drinking, I can do anything." 

From a symbolic perspective, the shadow aspect of the Addict represents a struggle with will power and the absence of self-control. People who are extremely intellectual or emotional frequently have a close link to this archetype, because they struggle to balance these powers. Without this internal balance, the will may give up its power to an external substance that exerts authority, providing shadow order to your life. The shadow Addict compromises your integrity and honesty. Many addicts, for example, steal as a means of supporting their habit. 

In evaluating your connection to the Addict, review how many of your life's challenges concern an external substance or a consistent, domineering pattern of trying to maintain order in your life. Although that challenge is a part of all of our lives, the degree to which an addiction controls you and your lifestyle determines whether the Addict is part of your intimate family of twelve. For instance, you can be inconsistent in your exercise program yet quite disciplined in your spiritual practice. Needing a substance or practice or person so intensely or regularly that you compromise relationships, finances, integrity, character, or emotional and psychological well-being, however, indicates that you should look very seriously at this archetype as a possible choice. iNo /uploadimages/1250873464-webaddict.jpg
2 Advocate Advocate (Attorney, Defender, Legislator, Lobbyist, Environmentalist) 

Coming to the defense of others is one manifestation of what Ram Dass calls "Compassion in Action." The Advocate embodies a sense of life-long devotion to championing the rights of others in the public arena. People who relate to this archetype have recognized early on a passion to transform social concerns, specifically in behalf of others. Symbolically, they are dedicated to inspiring the empowerment of groups or causes that are unable to be empowered on their own. By comparison, archetypes such as the Hermit are clearly more personal and lack the Advocate's fire for furthering social change. The Advocate needs public expression, even if only through writing or artwork. 

The shadow Advocate manifests in false or negative causes or in committing to causes for personal gain. In evaluating your connection with this archetype, you should ask yourself how much of your life is dedicated to social causes and a willingness to take action. /uploadimages/1278882196-green-peace-sign.jpg
3 Alchemist Alchemist (Wizard, Magician, Scientist, Inventor--see also Visionary) 

These archetypes share the common trait of converting some form of matter into an altered expression of itself. The Wizard and Magician produce results outside the ordinary rules of life, whether causing people to fall in love or objects to disappear. Whereas a Wizard is associated with supernatural powers, the Magician tends to be seen more as an entertainer. The Alchemist is associated with vain attempts to turn base metals into gold, but in its highest manifestation it seeks complete spiritual transformation. You may identify with this archetype if you are interested in a path of spiritual development that is aligned to the mystery schools or study of the laws of the universe. From this perspective, Nostradamus and Isaac Newton could both be classified as Alchemists. 

The shadow sides of these archetypes are found in the misuse of the power and knowledge that comes through them. Seduction and trickery brought about through magic and wizardry play on the desires of many people to transform their lives

For the Alchemist or Wizard to be one of your circle of twelve, it needs to be associated with your physical life in some significant way. Perhaps your work or living situation demands that you be especially inventive or interventionist on a regular basis. The shadow Wizard manifests either as the use of ingenuity for criminal or unethical purposes or as feelings of superiority based on high intellect. /uploadimages/1278882476-wizard.jpg
4 Angel Angel (Fairy Godmother/Godfather) 

Angels exist in a category unto themselves because they are thought to be living beings of Light and messengers of the Divine. Almost every cultural and religious tradition on earth features angels of some description, including belief in a personal Guardian Angel in the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. Angels are typically represented as winged beings who intervene in times of great need or for the purpose of delivering a message of guidance or instruction from God to humans. Even though you probably aren't an actual Angel, you can acknowledge a strong connection to the angelic realm, as noted in people who have a dedication to representing the presence of angels. Artists who paint their images, for example, authors who write about their interaction with humans, and those whose lives in some way provide a channel through which their presence is physically manifested exhibit a rapport with the angelic realm. Some people are also referred to as "angels" because of the loving and nurturing qualities of character that they embody. One may also play the role of a Fairy Godmother or Godfather by helping someone in need, either anonymously or with no expectation of any return. 

The shadow side of this archetype manifests through people who make claims to be in touch with angelic guidance for the sake of control or ego enhancement, or who act innocent or angelic to mislead others about their true nature. From a biblical perspective, the shadow Angel is frequently associated with Satan or Lucifer, but the Devil or Demon should also be considered as a unique archetype. /uploadimages/1278882828-angel.jpg
5 Artist Artist (Artisan, Craftsperson, Sculptor, Weaver) 

The Artist archetype embodies the passion to express a dimension of life that is just beyond the five senses. The Artist psyche is animated with the energy to express it into physical forms. The nature or relative grandeur of any form of expression is irrelevant; a chef can be as much of an artist as a painter or landscaper. The signature of artists is not in what they do but in how intense their motivation is to manifest the extraordinary. Doing what you do in such a way that you create an emotional field that inspires others also indicates the Artist energy at work, as does the emotional and psychological need to express yourself so much that your well-being is wrapped up in this energy. 

The shadow Artist comprises many clichÈs, including an eccentric nature and the madness that often accompanies genius. The Starving Artist represents the fear of financial ruin or the belief that fame and fortune come only after death, which often cause artists to suppress their talents. In evaluating your relationship to this archetype, recognize that the need to bring art to others, such as dedicating part of the energy of your life to supporting artists, is as much an expression of the Artist archetype as actually holding a brush in your hand. /uploadimages/1278883293-artist.jpg
6 Athlete Athlete (Olympian) 

This archetype represents the ultimate expression of the strength of the human spirit as represented in the power and magnificence of the human body. Because the Olympian is so connected to spiritual as well as physical strength, a code of ethics and morality is associated with the archetype, which is an excellent example of the universal power of the "psyche" of an archetype. A link to the Athlete should not be evaluated by whether your physical skill is on par with that of professionals or whether your body is perfect in form and function. A person dedicated to transcending the limits of a physical handicap qualifies as much for this archetype as the professional or artistic athlete, because the development of personal will power and strength of spirit is a requirement for the body to manifest its perfection. 

The shadow aspect of athletics, however, may manifest as a misuse of one's strength against any sort of person or opponent in the world, even outside the field of professional athletics, such as a professional boxer who starts a bar fight; a false sense of invulnerability, like Achilles' and Samson's; dirty play; or colluding with gamblers (See Bully). The shadow may also appear as a lack of honor that compels you to cheat to win. /uploadimages/1279011694-business-athlete-driven.jpg
7 Avenger Avenger (Avenging Angel, Savior, Messiah) 

This archetype and its related manifestations respond to a need to balance the scales of justice, sometimes by employing aggressive techniques. Attorneys who work for the impoverished or disadvantaged or who volunteer part of their time for pr bono work are modern avengers. Bringing war criminals to trial or legally pursuing corporations that harm society are examples of the Avenger on a global scale, fueled by a sense of righteousness in behalf of society. One can also be motivated to avenge an injustice against oneself or one's family. The Avenging Angel is an expression of this archetype of mythic proportions that suggests that one is on a mission from God, as in the case of Joan of Arc. 

On the global level, the shadow manifests as avenging perceived immoral behavior by resorting to violence, from acts of ecoterroism to bombing abortion clinics. The "rightness" of one's cause can never justify harming innocent third parties. (Gandhi countered the shadow of social vengeance by emphasizing passive resistance to illegitimate authority.) In evaluating your connection to this archetype, review your life for experiences in which your primary motivation was to defend or represent a cause in behalf of others. One instance is not enough. You need to relate to this archetype as a primary force through which many of the choices and actions of your life are directed. A burning desire to get even can be so forceful that you organize a lifetime around meeting that end. /uploadimages/1279033140-sekhmet_43-295x300.jpg
8 Beggar Beggar (Homeless person/ Indigent) 

Completely without material resources, the Beggar is associated with dependence on the kindness of others, living on the streets, starvation, and disease, whether in New York City or Calcutta. It is easy to believe that the archetype of the Beggar is solely a negative one, but that is an illusion. A person need hardly be starving for food to be considered a Beggar. People "beg" for attention, love, authority, and material objects. We "throw a dog a bone" to give a powerless being a "treat" of power. From a symbolic perspective, the Beggar archetype represents a test that compels a person to confront self-empowerment beginning at the base level of physical survival. Learning about the nature of generosity, compassion, and self-esteem are fundamental to this archetypal pattern. /uploadimages/1279033633-humble .jpg
9 Bully Bully (Coward) 

The archetype of the Bully manifests the core truth that the spirit is always stronger than the body. Symbolically, our physical bodies can "bully" our spirits with any number of reasons why we should back down from our challenges, which appear to overwhelm us by their size and shape. Your relationship to this archetype should be evaluated within a framework far more expansive than evaluating whether you "bully" people. Consider whether on your life path you confront one experience and relationship after another that appears to have more power than you and ultimately leads you to ask, "Will I stand up to this challenge?" People are often called to take on bullies for the sake of others, as David did Goliath, and this is another criterion of your connection to this archetype. 

Conventional wisdom holds that underneath a bully is a coward trying to keep others from discovering his true identity. Symbolically, the Coward within must stand up to being bullied by his own inner fears, which is the path to empowerment through these two archetypes. /uploadimages/1279034909-i hate.jpg
10 Child Child (Orphan, Wounded, Magical/Innocent, Nature, Divine, Puer/Puella Eternis, or Eternal Boy/Girl) 

Everyone has expressions of each one of these aspects of the Child within his psyche, although one aspect is usually so dominant that it eclipses the energy of the others. The Wounded Child, for example, can be so needy that it is almost impossible for the Magical Child to manifest its qualities. At the same time, because every one of the Child aspects is present in various degrees of strength in every psyche, similar patterns often overlap, making it hard to distinguish which one you relate to most intensely. You may find that you relate equally to the Orphan and the Wounded Child, or to the Puer Eternis and the Nature Child. When this is the case, choose one and include the specific qualities that you relate to in the other archetype as you investigate the psyche of this archetype in your life. /uploadimages/1279037945-ChildRunning.jpg

Versatility is the hallmark of Gemini's.  This is the first dual sign of the zodiac and its subjects find it essential to pursue several courses of action at once.  They also need to communicate on all levels.  Their potential can be expressed in many ways, but especially through the media.  This need for communication is so strong that they'll telephone their local radio station with comments on every conceivable subject and will even chat to someone in a bus queue if no one else is available at the time. /13chakraimages/1147988250-CAER84XH.jpg 1148381034 95

26 Sacred Contracts The Journey Course Archetypes ñ An Individual Blueprint of Life Direction

There is a stage during our lives that we reach, where the search for meaning prompts us to ask: Do I have a destiny? What is my purpose in life? Or: Where am I going? To answer these questions and more we need to:


ï Identify the patterns from your history that contribute to your current behavior, 

ï Cross match this information to archetypal patterns

ï Then use this information to create a blue print of your lifeís journey, effectively
a map that can add meaning and deeper self understanding. 



On a physical level, archetypes are roles that we play seemingly without choice, contributing to the depletion or enhancement of our energy reserves.



On a soul level archetypes become individual expressions of our character. As we assert ourselves as individuals, we develop our strengths, become aware of our weaknesses and so create more scope for choice in life. 



On a transpersonal, spiritual level they represent challenges we have overcome in order to strengthen our connection to the life force itself. According to our perspective and awareness of our own archetypes, all levels of our well being will be affected by these patterns: physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. 
Creating an individual map for life direction means: 

ï You now have a lifelong tool you can use to empower yourself. 

 ï You can use your blueprint to help solve problems, regain perspective and explore your inner worlds.

       ï You now have a blueprint of your personal energy system
   
  ï You now have a personal map that reflects your individual journey you can use as a guide map to expand upon for the rest of your life.

 ï It will show you what to do to convert your fears into strengths
  ï You will gain insights into how you can get to know yourself, your lifeís path and your purpose.
 
ï It reveals your potential
ï It reveals your challenges
ï It reveals your blessings 
ï It reveals your options and choices for change through a spiritually symbolic perspective


Becoming aware of your archetypes and their challenges gives you the choice to avoid making mistakes or making the same ones over and over. Archetypal awareness enables you to view your life symbolically, knowing that everything that has happened is something we could learn from - everyone in our lives becomes a teacher

Students learn both personally and professionally how to select, cast
and interpret an archetypal chart.

119 Archetypes and Sacred Contracts Course Sacred contracts and archetypes.

Have you ever wondered why you‚Äôre here, in this life, why certain things have happened to you, and what your highest potential is?

What has had the biggest impact on you and changed the direction of your life? Why did it have to happen this way, what were the circumstances, who was involved and most importantly, what did you learn from this?

Aren‚Äôt these the questions we ask ourselves on a regular basis? mainly during those turbulent times, in answering these we see a bigger picture and meaning to our lives and we begin to see our sacred contract, or what we‚Äôre here to do in this lifetime. 

For example the health crisis that takes us into a completely new direction, the traumatic divorce which forces us to walk, unaided, into our fears thus releasing a potential we never glimpsed before or the frustration at ‚Äòfailure‚Äô that is only expressed through a paint brush and canvass. 

This is living your sacred contract and the helpers along the way, those who forced change upon you, are the angels of change itself.

Looking at your sacred contract in this way will help you be better prepared to accept the inevitable life changes; it‚Äôs the overall relationship between your personal power and to spiritual power. 

To help us on our journey we need certain gifts and skills, and these are our archetypes. An archetype is an impersonal pattern of influence that is universal to all, it‚Äôs a conscious pattern, our soul‚Äôs blue print, for example an artist expresses him/herself by using form, colour and creativity, not necessarily painting for a living though, and may not paint at all but they ‚Äòsee‚Äô life through an artistic lens producing a unique expression of their view of the world. Certain characteristics are the same for all artists and when we see it, we recognise it, whether we‚Äôre an artist or not. 

We all have 12 archetypes, 4 common to all and 8 others we choose consciously, these have been our constant companions throughout our life and help us attain our sacred contract.

Once we‚Äôve identified our archetypes we can cast a chart of origin to see exactly where they have the greatest influence in our life, this unique support team will give you guidance and wisdom on the fluid dynamics of the dance of life.  Second and third wheel charts can be cast working with the today‚Äôs energy and divine wisdom, giving us the message from 3 archetypes to read as guidance.

Selecting your archetypes, casting a wheel and interpreting it is spiritual alchemy and has profound healing and transformational power available for you. 

The four survival archetypes (common to all).
These show up when we‚Äôre not being true to our soul‚Äôs contract and are our most trusted allies.

The child- or the guardian of innocence. 
Wounded, magical, orphan, invisible, eternal, dependant, nature, or divine child.
Your child is about new life, rebirth, playfulness and light heartedness, but a child can‚Äôt take responsibility- it‚Äôs not my fault, you‚Äôre to blame, and how many times have we said that?

Prostitute- or guardian of faith 
Have you ever: 
ÔÅºsold or negotiated your integrity?
ÔÅºsold out your talents, ideas or expression of your true self?
ÔÅºcompromised your mind/body and /or spirit.
How much faith do you have in you?

Saboteur- guardian of choice or how you betray yourself. 
Ask:
ÔÅºwhat fears have authority over me?
ÔÅºwho makes the choices in your life?
Can‚Äôt, won‚Äôt, shouldn‚Äôt, wouldn‚Äôt, couldn‚Äôt etc is the language of the saboteur.

Victim- the guardian of self esteem
Do you:
ÔÅº feel victim or victorious?
ÔÅºpowerless or powerful?

2 WHAT ARE INDIGO AND CRYSTAL CHILDREN AND ADULTS? [center][size=12][sub][/sub]How do you know if you, or someone you know, is an Indigo or Crystal Child or Adult?[/size][/center]

We will describe the main features and characteristics of these people. But we want to stress that the Indigo/Crystal phenomenon is the next step in our evolution as a human species. We are all, in some way, becoming more like the Indigo and Crystal people. They are here to show us the way, and so the information can be applied more generally to all of us as we make the transition to the next stage of our growth and evolution. 

The Indigo Children have been incarnating on the Earth for the last 100 years. The early Indigos were pioneers and wayshowers. After World War II, a significant number were born, and these are the Indigo adults of today. However, in the 1970s a major wave of Indigos was born, and so we have a whole generation of Indigos who are now in their late twenties and early thirties who are about to take their place as leaders in the world. Indigos continued to born up to about 2000, with increasing abilities and degrees of technological and creative sophistication. 

The Crystal Children began to appear on the planet from about 2000, although some date them slightly earlier. These are extremely powerful children, whose main purpose is to take us to the next level in our evolution, and reveal to us our inner power and divinity. They function as a group consciousness rather than as individuals, and they live by the" Law of One" or Unity Consciousness. They are a powerful force for love and peace on the planet. 

The Indigo and Crystal Adults are composed of two groups. Firstly, there are those who were born as Indigos and are now making the transition to Crystal. This means they undergo a spiritual and physical transformation that awakens their "Christ" or "Crystal" consciousness and links them with the Crystal children as part of the evolutionary wave of change. The second group is those who were born without these qualities, but have aquired or are in the process of aquiring them through their own hard work and the diligent following of a spiritual path. Yes, this means that all of us have the potential to be part of the emerging group of "human angels". 

The following extract describes the difference between Indigo and Crystal Children. It is from Doreen Virtue's article Indigo and Crystal Children: 

The first thing most people notice about Crystal Children is their eyes, large, penetrating, and wise beyond their years. Their eyes lock on and hypnotize you, while you realize your soul is being laid bare for the child to see. Perhaps you've noticed this special new "breed" of children rapidly populating our planet. They are happy, delightful and forgiving. This generation of new lightworkers, roughly ages 0 through 7, are like no previous generation. Ideal in many ways, they are the pointers for where humanity is headed ... and its a good direction! 

The older children (approximately age 7 through 25), called "indigo Children", share some characteristics with the Crystal Children. Both generations are highly sensitive and psychic, and have important life purposes. The main difference is their temperament. Indigos have a warrior spirit, because their collective purpose is to mash down old systems that no longer serve us. They are here to quash government, educational, and legal systems that lack integrity. To accomplish this end, they need tempers and fiery determination. 

Those adults who resist change and who value conformity may misunderstand the Indigos. They are often mislabeled with psychiatric diagnoses of Attention Deficit with Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Sadly, when they are medicated, the Indigos often lose their beautiful sensitivity, spiritual gifts and warrior energy..........In contrast, the Crystal Children are blissful and even-tempered. Sure, they may have tantrums occasionally, but these children are largely forgiving and easy-going. The Crystals are the generation who benefit from the Indigos trailblazing. First, the Indigo Children lead with a machete, cutting down anything that lacks integrity. Then the Crystal Children follow the cleared path, into a safer and more secure world. 

The terms "Indigo" and "Crystal" were given to these two generations because they most accurately describe their aura colours and energy patterns. Indigo children have a lot of indigo blue in their auras. This is the colour of the "third eye chakra", which is the energy center inside the head located between the two eyebrows. This chakra regulates clairvoyance, or the ability to see energy, visions, and spirits. Many of the Indigo children are clairvoyant 

The Crystal Children have opalescent auras, with beautiful multi-colours in pastel hues. This generation also shows a fascination for crystals and rocks...... 

Indigo Children can sense dishonesty, like a dog can sense fear. Indigos know when they're being lied to, patronized, or manipulated. And since their collective purpose is to usher us into a new world of integrity, the Indigos inner lie-detectors are integral. As mentioned before, this warrior spirit is threatening to some adults. And the Indigos are unable to conform to dysfunctional situations at home, work, or school. They don't have the ability to dissociate from their feelings and pretend like everything's okay ...unless they are medicated or sedated. 

Crystal Children's innate spiritual gifts are also misunderstood. Specifically, their telepathic abilities which lead them to talk later in life. 

In the new world which the Indigos are ushering in, we will all be much more aware of our intuitive thoughts and feelings. We won't rely so much upon the spoken or written word. Communication will be faster, more direct, and more honest, because it will be mind to mind. Already, increasing numbers of us are getting in touch with our psychic abilities. Our interest in the paranormal is at an all-time high, accompanied by books, television shows, and movies on the topic. 

So, it's not surprising that the generation following the Indigos are incredibly telepathic. Many of the Crystal Children have delayed speech patterns, and its not uncommon for them to wait until they're 3 or 4 years old to begin speaking. But parents tell me they have no trouble communicating with their silent children. Far from it! The parents engage in mind-to-mind communication with their Crystal Children. And the Crystals use a combination of telepathy, self-fashioned sign language, and sounds (including song) to get their point across. /indigoimages/1162036627-1161533340-ragspromo.jpg 2006-10-28
3 The National Foundation for Gifted and Creative Children [sub]Characteristics of Gifted/Creative Children[/sub]

[b]A. High sensitivity 

B. Excessive amounts of energy. 

C. Bores easily and may appear to have a short attention span. 

D. Requires emotionally stable and secure adults around him/her. 

E. Will resist authority if it not democratically oriented. 

F. Have preferred ways of learning; particularly in reading and mathematics. 

G. May become easily frustrated because of his/her big ideas and not having the resources or people to assist him/her in carrying these tasks to fruition. 

H. Learns from an exploratory level and resists rote memory and just being a listener. 

I. Cannot sit still unless absorbed in something of his/her own interest. 

J. Very compassionate and has many fears such as death and loss of loved ones. 

K. If they experience failure early, may give up and develop permanent learning blocks. 

Gifted children may also withdraw when they feel threatened or alienated and may sacrifice their creativity in order to "belong". Many children that we test exhibit a high IQ, but they often exhibit "frozen" creativity as well. Often there is an ability to express their feelings initially. We work to assist the child to become open, flexible and to be able to accept failure by developing higher frustration levels. [/b]

5 An Epidemic of ADD or a Matter of Overdiagnosis? Does ADD Really Exist? [color=blue][/color][sub][/sub]
Thomas Armstrong, Ph.D., in his controversial book The Myth of the ADD Child, insists that ADD is a diagnosis aimed at forcing children to behave in a particular, narrowly defined manners.2 He claims that children have different learning styles, respond to stress in various ways, and that the condition has been radically overdiagnosed and overtreated. He encourages a wide variety of nondrug interventions including adjustment of the classroom setup, more kinesthetic learning, project-based learning, martial arts classes, visualization, and meditation. 

A similar viewpoint is held by Peter Breggin, M.D., author of Toxic Psychiatry and The War Against Children. Dr. Breggin, a psychiatrist who refuses to prescribe Ritalin for his patients diagnosed with ADD, holds a strong belief that there is no evidence that symptoms associated with ADD constitute a diagnosis or a mental disorder. He voices strong concerns about the possibly damaging long-term effects of Ritalin.3


Still a third health professional, child psychiatrist Dr. Stanley Greenspan, writes in his book The Challenging Child that a number of attention problems are due to visual, auditory, motor, and special processing difficulties. Children with all of these individual difficulties, according to Dr. Greenspan, are often misdiagnosed with ADD.4


As homeopathic physicians, we do not believe that it is helpful to lump so many people with widely differing symptoms into one syndrome and treat them all with similar drugs. Having seen several hundred children with mild to major behavioral, learning, and attitude problems, we believe that these children need to be handled as individuals with unique problems rather than treated stereotypically. We also favor a treatment approach, homeopathy, that lasts for months or years, not just a few hours.

[b]
[center]What About Neurotransmitters?[/center] [/b]

Most physicians and mental health professionals attribute ADD to an imbalance in transmitters within the brain, often serotonin. Many studies have attempted to correlate ADD with specific neurotransmitter abnormalities. A group of researchers from the University of Georgia reviewed these neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological theories and studies.5 They concluded that although there is evidence of neurological differences in children diagnosed with ADD, no definitive mechanism has been found for these differences. The authors recommended a differential diagnosis of ADD, learning disability, and conduct disorder. They suggest that it may be more accurate to view the syndrome as a cluster of various behavioral deficits, including attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which share a common response to psychostimulants. In other words, a neurotransmitter imbalance is an impressive way to explain ADD, but remains questionable. 

 

[b][center]An Overstimulated Society[/center][/b]

One correlation which is clear to us is the increasingly rapid pace of our highly technological society and a growing number of children diagnosed with ADD. We live in an extremely overstimulated society. Children spend hours playing Nintendo rather than romping through the woods or playing outside. Many are glued to the television set. Movies are speedier, scarier, and more violent than ever before. There is a growing atmosphere of hurriedness, intensity, and urgency. Many children and teenagers do not leave home without their beepers for fear of missing something for even a moment. We eat fast, play fast, and channel-surf. We eat in fast-food restaurants known to decorate their premises in jangly colors so that their customers will eat quickly and move on to make space for the next shift. People look for caffeine and drugs of all kinds to make them go faster and stay up longer. They buy double espressos to pick them up more quickly. They use highly caffeinated amphetamine-like herbs, including ma huang and guarana, that contain seven times as much caffeine as coffee. Our society places little value on tranquillity, quiet, solitude, and the simple joy of being in nature.


Biofeedback is one method to induce deep relaxation by altering brain waves through selective reinforcement. Some have found biofeedback to be helpful for ADD, but the need for frequent treatments may put it economically out of reach for many children and adults.


[b][center]Is ADD a Dietary Problem? [/center][/b]

Parents often tell us that their child's behavior is considerably worse the morning after Halloween or after any sugar binge. Their perceptions have recently been supported by researchers at the Yale University School of Medicine. They found that within a few hours after substantial sugar intake, children release large amounts of adrenaline, which causes them to experience shakiness, anxiety, excitement, and concentration problems. Their brain waves also indicated a decreased ability to focus.6


As naturopathic physicians with considerable training in nutrition, we are appalled that the per capita intake of sugar is over 130 pounds per year in this country and that children are the worst fast-food junkies. Many of the parents of our ADD child patients are very nutritionally aware and have had their children tested for food and environmental allergens. Those children we have seen, despite eliminating cow's milk, wheat, and other foods from their diets, have not experienced a consistent and significant improvement in behavior or learning. Some parents have tried the Feingold dietary approach, which eliminates foods with natural salicylates, artificial colors, 

flavorings, additives, and preservatives. Yet a review of the literature indicated that the Feingold diet has helped only a small percentage of children with ADD.7 In those cases where allergies and sensitivities to additives are a major problem, it is helpful to remove or restrict them. A healthy diet which emphasizes whole, natural foods is likely to benefit the health of any child or adult with ADD and is a useful part of the total treatment plan.


Yet both in examining the scientific literature concerning diet and ADD and in interviewing parents of children with ADD, we have found correlations between ADD and sugar consumption, ingestion of food additives and colorings, and food allergies, and hypoglycemic and anti-yeast diets, to affect some children and not others. We have not found that changing a child's diet has nearly as consistent, profound, and lasting impact on behavioral and learning problems as homeopathic treatment. Dietary approaches undoubtedly do work for some children, but not for many others. We admit that children who have enjoyed a great improvement in behavior strictly from dietary change are not likely to turn up in the office of a homeopath unless their dietary measures stop working and the parents seek out an alternative other than dietary intervention.



[center][b]Is the Diagnosis of ADD Just A Way to Control the Classroom? [/b][/center]

How true are criticisms like those of Drs. Armstrong and Breggin that the overdiagnosis of ADD is a means for teachers and parents to stultify children's freedom and individuality? It is true that some teachers are excessively rigid and wish to run their classrooms like a military academy. 


These are the same teachers who bring the parents of any unruly child in for a conference and put pressure on them to put their children on stimulant medications. It is also true that many classrooms have more children than the teacher can possibly handle, and that some of these children are frighteningly violent and exhibit an antipathy to learning. However, other teachers sincerely wish to create more relaxed learning environments in which imagination and creativity are fostered. They, too, often find a growing number of restless, disruptive children who find it next to impossible to concentrate.


Try telling the parent of a child with full-blown ADD, who has tried every possible learning style including home schooling, that the diagnosis is all in the mind of the child's teacher and that her child just needs a less structured learning environment. That parent may look at you in disbelief, insist that her child live with you for a week, and then see what you think.


[b][center]Gifted or Hyperactive?[/center][/b]


One group of children that may be included in the diagnostic category of ADD but which has very specific needs is precocious children with ADD-like symptoms. If you had an IQ of 150 and a photographic mind, how would you feel about being in a regular fourth-grade classroom? You would probably be bored to tears unless your teacher created special activities and outlets for your unusual intellectual capabilities. You might tap your pencil on your desk, design paper skyscrapers, or invent a magical world of dinosaurs. Then when the teacher called on you . and Hobbes.. . cops! Sounds a lot like Calvin 


James Webb and Diane Latimer address this dilemma: "In the classroom, a gifted child's perceived inability to stay on task might be related to boredom, curriculum, mismatched learning style, or other environmental factors. Gifted children may spend from onefourth to one-half of their regular classroom time waiting for others to catch up-even more if they are in a heterogeneously grouped class."8 They point out that because a gifted child may demonstrate ADD-like behaviors in some settings and not others, one classroom teacher may diagnose her with ADD while the other teachers do not. The authors recommend individual evaluation followed by appropriate curricular and instructional changes to account for advanced knowledge, diverse learning styles, and various types of intelligence. Such individual evaluation is exactly what homeopathy has to offer.


[center][b]
Like Parent, Like Child[/b][/center]

We have seen many children who are the spitting image of their parents. They may share one or both parents' behavioral and learning styles. We often hear that the mother or father also had difficulty with reading or concentration, but was never diagnosed as having ADD and somehow made it through school. We have seen little boys with the same explosive tempers and total lack of patience as their type A fathers. We have also seen many a child whose restlessness and inability to concentrate ran through all of the siblings in the family. You will see 

this phenomenon reflected in some of our case histories later in the book.

Many experts have documented a hereditary aspect to ADD. We saw one child whose chief problem was absentmindedness in spite of intellectual brilliance. All he wanted to do was to read about atoms and quarks and to contemplate the boundlessness of the universe. His father was the same way: brilliant, but he could barely remember to change his socks. His father's father was a renowned educator who had had a number of car accidents because he couldn't be bothered to keep his car on the road. They were like carbon copies of each other.


Yet we see other children whose tantrums, violence, and excessive restlessness seem to come out of nowhere. They may have very mellow parents who have limited their children's exposure to guns, sugar, and violent movies and who have raised them in a very loving, safe environment-and they still behave like wildcats.



[b][center]A Matter of Predisposition [/center][/b]

Even if they have two parents with ADD and eat sugar all day, some children will develop ADD and others will not. What can account for this disparity? Homeopaths believe that the reason some children and adults suffer from ADD and others do not lies in susceptibility. If you ask the parent of a child with ADD when he first noticed problem behaviors or tendencies in his child, he will likely say from infancy or toddlerhood. Such a child may have been hyperalert and have tendencies to wake frequently during the night, to be fussy and hard to satisfy, to run as soon as he could walk, and to climb all over the furniture as soon as he was mobile. This predisposition 

to ADD-like behavior often occurs at a very tender age. Homeopaths frequently observe that this predisposition or susceptibility depends on the constitution of the individual from birth and may even be affected by the state of the parents prior to conception and during pregnancy.


How is this susceptibility passed on? Genetically? Homeopaths recognize these common traits among parents and children and hypothesize that there is some mechanism which we do not yet understand for these impressions or threads to be passed on generationally.Researchers at the University of California, Irvine recently reported finding the first abnormal gene associated with ADD. The gene controls dopamine receptors in the brain. Children with a more severe form of ADD have an abnormality of this gene, causing less sensitivity to dopamine, a neurotransmitter. Ritalin is known to stimulate dopamine release, perhaps accounting for the drug's efficacy.9


Most important to the homeopath are the unique tendencies or predispositions of the individual child or adult, regardless of what specifically may trigger the susceptibility. The phenomenon of susceptibility varies from individual to individual and cannot be stereotyped. But the individual can be carefully listened to and deeply understood. And from this understanding, a homeopathic medicine can be matched to the individual which will shift that susceptibility and bring the person into balance. 

[b]No Single Cause of ADD[size=12][/size][/b]

Our conclusion, which is not particularly surprising given that we are homeopaths, is that each child or adult with ADD is individual. The cause of his ADD is no more stereotypical than his symptoms. Other than saying that anyone with ADD must have a predisposition to it, be it hereditary or environmental, we believe it is fruitless to ascribe all of the individual ADDs to one causative factor. Even if researchers conclude that every person with ADD has a deficiency or excess of one specific neurotransmitter, it is still an observation and not the underlying cause of the problem.

[left]During 2004, the United States prescribed 29 million prescriptions for Ritalin (stimulant), Prozac (antidepressant) and other ADHD drugs, [b]23 million of these were for children as young as two years.[/b]

In the UK no-one knows exactly how many children are taking Ritalin, but it is estimated that up to 3% children and 2% of adults are affected by ADHD in the UK.

The causes of ADHD are unclear, but thought to include both genetic and enviromental influences; links with fizzy drinks and diet have also been indicated.

The launch of new guidance for the NHS on ADHD warns that Ritalin and similar drugs can produce numerous undesirable side-effects including long term psychiatric and behavioural problems.   
The guidelines say parent training and education programmes should be offered first. The programmes show parents how to create a structured home enviroment, encourage attentiveness and concentration, and better manage misbehaviour.  Research shows they can be highly effective, helping children do better at school and lead more normal lives. 
Teachers should also be involved
 
Labelling a child with a ëpsychiatric illnessí can have devastating affects on how they view themselves and others treat them.  The child feels dis-empowered and is often told there is "nothing you can do about it". This robs him/her of responsibility.
A child should and can learn to be in control of their behaviour.[/left] 2008-09-28

1 How The Signs Deal With Near Death Experiences! Paul Newman '2005 - The Back Pages' [sub][b]LIBRA:[/b][/sub] Floating out of the body, then in, then out, then in, and finally out again.....Libra sees a tunnel and a vibrant being of light at the other end. "Wow, is that Jesus? Wait a minute, maybe it's Kwan Yin - that looks like something she'd wear." Never deciding whether to go through the tunnel or not (after all, what's death without someone to share it with?). Libra ends up back in the body be default, hounded by the mysterious compulsion to start a dating service for discarnate souls. 

[b][sub]TAURUS:[/sub][/b] Leaving the body, Taurus realizes he no longer has a stomach and immediately returns to the body (thud!), without seeing tunnels, light, God, etc.,.. making Taurus skeptical for the rest of his life. 

[b][sub]VIRGO[/sub][/b]: Working a triathon 60 hours straight, Virgo collapses and leaves the body. She moves through that delightfully clean and sparkling tunnel of light, occasionally reflecting upon possible improvements...but soon becomes so worried by the thought of her loved ones "managing without her" that she snaps back into her body like white lightning, sits up, and calmly pronounces herself alive, glancing at her watch. 

[b][sub]SCOPRIO[/sub][/b]: Since most Scoprios have nine lives, they tend to brainstorm different ways to trigger near death experience. Once nearly dead, most can barely get to the end of the tunnel without meeting some being with whom they have astral sex. When asked whom they prefer to greet them on the other side, 75% name a favorite vampire, and Medusa is a strong contender. 

[b][sub]GEMINI[/sub][/b]: The key thing to the zodiacal twins isn't the experience itself, but how they can embellish it when telling the story (or writing about it ). Since Geminis are comfortable in all worlds, except those without telephones, they usually bounce back to the body fairly rapidly - and the mouth tends to work before the rest of the body comes back to life. 

[b][sub]AQUARIUS:[/sub][/b] Aquarius gets to the pearly gates, sees that heaven isn't run by consensus, and opts for hell, where at least there is an appealing anarchy and rules are made to be broken. Ironically, Aquarian near death experiences tend to be extremely traditional, i.e., God the Father, St Peter, the celestial choir, and on and on, (another reason to opt for hell). Once in the underworld, they bedevil the hell out of Satan and his cronies with their loud and vigorous campaigns for progressive reforms, and are quickly expelled back to the body. 

[b][sub]
SAGITTARIUS[/sub][/b]: Sag floats out of her body and has to laugh at the stupid way she kicked the bucket. After somehow breaking the tunnel of light, she absolutely refuses to return to the body, since she's been trying to get out of it for all these years via clumsy accidents. As Sag is immensely curious about whether the so-called organized religious have any validity at all, this stroke of luck leads to amazing lessons until, alas, the astral folks tire of her and trick her into returning to Earth for the duration. 

[b][sub]ARIES [/sub][/b]"Who's in charge here? I'd like to see God right now, please. Am I dead? Wow, I never thought that could happen to me! Where can I get a crystal palace backlit with white light like that one?" 

[b][sub]CAPRICORN[/sub][/b]: It might take Capricorn a little while to realize he is dead because there are special rooms set up to look like executive offices for newly-dead goats. A sharp looking, older gentleman-ghost comes in and gives Cap an instruction manual titled "HOW TO PROFIT IN THE ASTRAL MARKETPLACE, plus a "job evaluation" type assessment of Cap's achievements and mistakes over the lifetime, followed by a P45. Caps tend to return to their bodies quickly, unable to tolerate non-physical existence for long. 

[b][sub]CANCER[/sub][/b]: Cancerians can live to 125 years old and they don't usually have near death experience; but they can come awfully close to having a near life experience when they get brave and venture out of their house for "supplies".

2 PRAY Don't know A voyaging ship was wrecked during a storm at sea and only two of the
men on it were able to swim to a small, desert like island. 
The two survivors, not knowing what else to do, agree that they had no
other recourse but to pray to God.
However, to find out whose prayer was more powerful, they agreed to
divide the territory between them and stay on opposite sides of the island.
The first thing they prayed for was food. The next morning, the first
man saw a fruit-bearing tree on his side of the land, and he was able
to eat its fruit. 
The other man's parcel of land remained barren.
After a week, the first man was lonely and he decided to pray for a
wife.
The next day, another ship was wrecked, and the only survivor was a
woman who swam to his side of the land. 
On the other side of the island, there was nothing.
Soon the first man prayed for a house, clothes, more food. The next
day, like magic, all of these were given to him. 
However, the second man still had nothing.
Finally, the first man prayed for a ship, so that he and his wife
could leave the island. 
In the morning, he found a ship docked at his side of the island. 
The first man boarded the ship with his wife and decided to leave the
second man on the island. 
He considered the other man unworthy to receive God\'s blessings, since none of his prayers had been answered.
As the ship was about to leave, the first man heard a voice from
heaven booming, "Why are you leaving your companion on the island?
My blessings are mine alone, since I was the one who prayed for them,
the first man answered. 
"His prayers were all unanswered and so he does not deserve anything."
"You are mistaken!" the voice rebuked him. "He had only one prayer,
which I answered. 
If not for that, you would not have received any of my blessings.
"Tell me," the first man asked the voice, "what did he pray for that I
should owe him anything"
"He prayed that all your prayers be answered."
For all we know, our blessings are not the fruits of our prayers alone,
but those of another praying for us. /newsimages/1154432116-CA8XEZKD.jpg 2006-08-01
3 Clown Chakra Solar [b][/b] 
Subject: [sub][color=red]The Clown Chakra~*~ THE CLOWN CHAKRA ~*~ [/color][/sub]The Clown scientists have found that all our problems can be placed under one heading: Seriousness. Seriousness isthe leading cause of everything from Cancer to Reincarnation. Scientists from the Clown Academy have already discovered a new source of healing. It is a psychic energy point located between the heart chakra and the throat chakra. It is called the clown chakra. If people are feeling miserable; if they have financial problems; if their relationship situation is the pits; if they are in ill health; if they have a need to sue people; if they find fault with their brother; then obviously their clown chakra is closed. When this happens, the scientists have observed under a high-powered microscope that the cells of every organ display a sad face; and when the clown chakra is open and functioning normally, the cells display a happy face. The scientists realized that if a person is ill, it is because his mind has projected guilt onto the cells of his body and has forced out the love that is normally found within each cell of the body. The cells are therefore saying, "I Lack Love", or ILL for short.The scientists also discovered that opened and working (or rather, playing) properly, the psychic mechanism sucks up misery, pain, anger, resentment, grievances, unhappiness and so on, and converts the energy into tiny red heart- shaped balloons. The red heart balloons contain God's Love and Joy. These balloons are directed to the "dis-eased" cell or situation, and a happy face appears instantly. When the light enters the darkness, the darkness is gone. Sometimes these red heart balloons are called endorphins, due to the fact that when anyone experiences them the feeling of separation ends - they experience being back home with the Father and hence are no longer an orphan. This is the well known "end orphan" (endorphin) effect. So if you think someone is attacking you,Clown Scientists recommend that you visualize sending that person red heartshaped balloons filled with God's Love and Joy. Remember to keep your clown chakra open and remember to laugh, seriousness causes reincarnation.

1 Complimentary Medicine In April 2003, Hazel Blears, then the Public Health Minister, announced that her Department will be spending £1.3 million researching Complementary Medicine to develop "a solid evidence base for complementary and alternative medicine" with a view to making it available on the NHS, possibly through GP Surgeries. 
Mr Gordon Brown, Complementary Medicine Representative at the Department of Health, states that they are now working with the Prince of Wales's Foundation, concerning Integrated Health and some Universities with regard to the Department of Health's research. 
It is apparent that this is a time of considerable transition for the practice and medical status of Complementary Medicine, particularly in view of the Department of Health's initiatives. Recent reports indicate that the demand for Complementary Medicine is expected to rise by 45% over the next five years. This follows a 60% growth over the past five years. Up to 20% of the population use complementary medicine. A survey by the University of Sheffield's Medical Care Research Unit in 1998 revealed patient expenditure on complementary medicine over the previous years as being £540 million. 2003-10-09

2 initiations.php Initiations / Ceremonies Initiations / Ceremonies [b][color=navy][u][center][size=12]Mother Blessing[/size][/center][/u][/color][/b]
The idea of holding a Mother Blessing came from my desire to give Ness a boost during the last months of her pregnancy ‚Äì she was tired, growing a baby body takes a lot of energy!   I initially thought of the American baby shower scenario but it just did not feel right so after a bit of research on the internet I came across the idea of a 
Mother Blessing.   

There is a Blessingway Ritual which is Native American in origin, coming from the Navajo tradition, whereby a blessing is held for the many and varied transitions that we all pass through in our lives.  The Blessingway rituals are very sacred but some of the essence of them can be used to create Mother and other Blessings.  

The Mother Blessing is held to honour the Mother to be, to gather people in a space and create a time of reflection, support and celebration.  Within this a circle of energy can be created for the soon to be Mummy, to show her she is loved and cared for and to facilitate a space wherein she can draw on the strength of those present to help energise her during the birthing process, when she thinks on the Blessing that has happened.

I gathered together close friends and kept it all as a surprise for Ness ‚Äì she knew she had to be at mine at a particular date and time but that was all.  Prior to the Blessing I spoke to all who were coming and asked them to bring with them a bead, a bead whereon they would make a wish for Ness and for her baby, which we would then thread onto a necklace which Ness could use as she chose; maybe during the birthing process or hanging over her bed or the baby‚Äôs cot.

On the morning of the Blessing I decorated the house, creating the space within to do the Blessing.   Ness arrived first, as planned, then as others arrived I asked them to thread some flowers that I had sorted out into Ness‚Äôs hair, this was a way for each person to say Hello as well as to symbolise the connection that we all have with nature.

When all had arrived and hellos been said we sat in a circle and did the following‚Ä¶

We all held hands and......

Lets spend a few moments connecting with each other ‚Äì as we invite love from the North, the South, the East, the West, Above & Below ‚Äì as we invite in Peace from the North, the South, the East, the West, Above and Below

We are gathered here together to support and love you Ness as you prepare for the beautiful experience of birth that you and your baby will take.  We are here to help mark this wonderous, magical transition that you are experiencing

We hope your baby may be aware of our love and you may feel your baby moving in response to our wishes and hopes for you both

We all know the great strength and enormous love that Ness has within her, we have each one of us been touched by her love and her special ness and now is an opportunity for us to show Ness our support and for Ness to know and feel the love that surrounds her.

Each of us has brought a bead with us - as we thread the beads onto this necklace we shall each make a wish for Ness and for her baby.  The wish may be said out loud or quietly - as each desires.  This necklace, Ness can then use as she wishes, perhaps during her birthing experience or hung over her bed or baby‚Äôs cot to remind her of our love and support.

After we have each threaded our beads I would like each of us to take one of these hearts, these hearts symbolised your connection with Ness and acts as reminder to each of us to continue sending our love and strength to Ness for her up and coming journey.

Each made their wishes ‚Äì my wish for my beautiful sister is for her and her baby to experience outrageous love and joy.

[b][color=navy]Then I read this poem:[/color][/b]

[center][font=arial][b]Before I was a Mum[/b]
Author Unknown

[color=navy][b]Before I was a Mum[/b][/color]
I slept as late as I wanted and never worried about how late I got into bed
I brushed my hair and my teeth everyday
I ate meals while they were still hot
I wore clothes that had no stains

[color=navy][b]Before I was a Mum[/b][/color]
I never looked into teary eyes and cried
I never got gloriously happy over a simple grin
I never sat up late at night watching a baby sleep
I never held a sleeping baby just because I didn‚Äôt want to put it down

[color=navy][b]Before I was a Mum[/b][/color]
I never knew that something so small could affect my life so much
I never knew that I could love someone so much
I never knew I would love being a mum
I didn‚Äôt know the feeling of having my heart outside my body

[color=navy]
[b]Before I was Mum[/color][/b]
I didn‚Äôt know how special it could feel to nurse a hungry baby
I didn‚Äôt know that something so small could make me feel so important and happy
I had never now the warmth, the joy, the love, the heartache, the wonderment or the satisfaction of being a Mum
I didn‚Äôt know I was capable of feeling so much before I was a Mum.[/font][/center]
We then ended the session by again holding hands and grounding the energy, thanking all for coming
[center]
[color=maroon][b]Feasting Time![/center][/b][/color]

The whole ceremony was beautiful there was much laughter and a few tears.  The desired result was achieve, Ness felt loved, cared for and energised by the Blessing.

I feel that these Blessings are a beautiful way of marking transitional phases in our lives, be they into motherhood, marriage, divorce, adoption, death or any other of the many changes we all experience.  In our society the marking of a ‚Äòrite of passage‚Äô can be somewhat lacking and within these Blessings we can create that space.   

The day after the Blessing Ness had a first ‚Äòshow‚Äô and 11 days later Hebe Grace arrived on the planet‚Ä¶ /uploadimages/1162310763-childrenplayingatduskonbeach.jpg 1160384973

5 archetypereading.php Archetype Reading Archetype Reading CMED Institute Sacred Contracts Graduate

For two years, I studied the nature of Sacred Contracts, learning how to do assist individuals to identify and interpret the archetypal patterns that comprise their own Sacred Contract. The study of Sacred Contracts is a rich and complex undertaking requiring the support of several other fields of knowledge, including theology, exploring the different psychic fields between fate and destiny and how to move forward into the energy of your destiny, the application of archetypal patterns to healing, using archetypal insight for problem solving and creative expression. Additionally, I learned to work with an expanded profile of thirty-six archetypes, providing individuals with a panoramic overview of their entire life's journey during an archetypal reading.

Archetype Reading 
I read the full archetypal Wheel using the archetypes you have picked or, I intuitively select them. Previous experience is not necessary.
You cannot image how understanding archetypal patterns opens up the symbolic world to you - and then you really see things differently.

[size=12]Archetype Wheel and Sacred Contract[/size]

You will be learning how to do identify and interpret the archetypal patterns in your own Sacred Contract. The reading of Sacred Contracts is a rich and complex undertaking exploring the different psychic fields between fate and destiny and how to move forward into the energy of your destiny, the application of archetypal patterns to healing, using archetypal insight for problem solving and creative expression. Additionally, you learn to work with an expanded profile of thirty-six archetypes, providing individuals with a panoramic overview of their entire life's journey during an archetypal reading.

In, Archetypes: I introduce archetypes in a way that makes them user-friendly.  I chose this voice because archetypes are so powerful and so complex that it is often best to introduce their power in disguise because this is what I know to be true about the nature of the psyche: The question, "Who Am I?" ('Who are you?' personally directed, obviously)  is itself a type of archetypal inquiry.  It is, in fact, one of the most significant questions that a person can ask in life.  That one question has the power to redirect the course of your life because you are asking to know the truth about the reason you were given the gift of your life.  Who Am I?  Beyond the clothing you wear, beyond the things you own, beyond your likes and dislikes, you want to know about your inner mysteries and the voice that drives you from within.  The truth is, however, that you are drawn by some mysterious need to make contact with your archetypal patterns and the core of your soul. It's just a matter of time, even in this timeless world of ours. Caroline new book "Who Am I" 
www.archetypeme.com

Sacred Contracts are mystical, inner agreements we have with our life path and with certain people on our life path. These agreements are not logical. They are mystical, mysterious, and hidden within the subtle forces that govern our life

Advanced Archetype For those who are already exploring Archetypes, Sarah offers individually tailored advice relating to the specific areas of concern:

- identifying archetypes in individual houses
- interviewing archetypes in individual houses
- house/archetype specific issues /uploadimages/1278966417-sacredcontracts.jpg

Chakra / Auras 

Chakra Reading What is a Chakra Reading? 

The intent of the reading is merely to uncover the information you already hold within yourself. I can help you make sense of why you conduct yourself in certain ways, and what you need to act on to change unsatisfactory patterns. Above all, it is intended to help you celebrate your own uniqueness

Are you ready to know what your chakras are broadcasting?

The 13 Chakra reading will describe the characteristic way in which a person thinks and behaves as he/she adapts/responds to the environment. This includes visible behavior patterns as well as those which are less apparent, but relatively enduring characteristics such as values, motives, attitudes, abilities and self images /uploadimages/1278966673-eyecolour.jpg

3 MS, my experience, story and reflections Erica Martin It was sudden and dramatic as it often is with the onset of MS. After a stressful weekend and the prospect of a long week ahead, I sat on the toilet early on Monday morning and realised I had no feelings in my left leg. I observed it dispassionately, I didnít have time to be ill and didnít have the awareness to realise this was a sign that from that moment onwards my life would never be the same again.

By the end of the week my symptoms had escalated, chronic fatigue had taken over, my co-ordination was breaking down making even the most simple tasks very difficult and my whole system was on a major shut down. With no option I took to my bed, and sometimes without even the energy to open my eyes I spent 7 weeks slowly building up enough energy to return to work.

All I wanted to do was continue on as before. I was unhappy in my job, a long-term relationship had just broken down, my mother was dying from cancer; my life was in shreds but all I could see was a future modelled on my past and my idea for the future were to continue on as before.

I returned to work and within minutes it was evident to everyone, including me that I was unable to do my job, and in fact any job. To add to everything else a ritual humiliation by my boss left in no doubt of my future career and prospects, there were none, I was on the scrap heap, with nothing to offer and all my years of hard work forgotten in an instant.

I returned to bed, this time for a total of 15 months. One minute I had a salary, a career, an identity and a future, the next I had a black hole and every cell in my body at a point of fatigue that left me with no energy, no reserves, no vitality, and no life force. I was an empty shell and on £52.50 per week sickness benefit.

Gradually a new wave of vitality began to emerge. I grew strength from the fact that this, as yet, unnamed condition had come from within (an auto-immune illness) therefore that was where I needed to go to find the cure, or the healer within. With time and peace I saw my former life as one big stressful unhappiness and had an insight into just how desperately unhappy and unfulfilled I had been. Not only was there no going back but also I didnít want to go there again.

The turning point was in the realisation that I could, if I wanted to, heal myself. Nobody else was going to and it was nobody elseís job. Yes, doctors and therapists can help and did (I cashed all my savings and paid for weekly counselling sessions, nothing much happened on a conscious level for the first few months, but I had nothing to lose and everything to gain- my health and life, so I persevered and in that came to terms with a lot of psychological issues and the past can not be changed but it can be looked at in a different way, so I re-interpreted it which eased the pain and allowed health to enter). 

Iíve always been aware of a spiritual dimension to life, I came into this existence knowing there is another reality and this knowledge helped me too. I wasnít afraid of dying, and some days I felt as if that was the only foreseeable outcome but I hadnít done what Iíd come to do, whatever that was, and the whole experience would have been wasted. I didnít want that and even if we donít know why weíre here, like it or not, weíre all here for a reason. And mine was not to die too soon (I later have come to see that just doing what I can in an authentic way and being true to myself is enough, we donít all have to have a big mission in life to make it worthwhile). Looking back Iíd say the turning point for me was in whether I wanted to live or die and if the answer was to live, Iíd better do something about it and fast too. That was a conscious decision I made and even if I was going to die, at least Iíd given healing my best shot and I could exit saying there was nothing else I could do. Having decided that the rest was relatively simple in that I had an aim, I now had trust and faith (thatís something that MS did give me) and as Iím Aries, fortunately courage comes naturally to me.

My mother died and with all the grief there was a blessed relief and release. I had never been the child she wanted and she had never been the mother I wanted either. I was free to stop trying to please her (and incidentally I never managed it) and all that effort could now be re-routed into creating a new healthy life, my life and to have the courage to be my own class act, and not live out the role of a disappointment.

In a way it was very easy being ill, everything happened around me. Neighbours and friends rallied, the bills got paid, I left the key on a piece of string by the front door (I didnít even have the strength to go and open it) and people let themselves in and out, the next day arrived, and then the next one and so on. Itís easy in that situation to trust because thereís no other course of action to take. Part of my healing and journey to wholeness (can you really be healed without being whole?) was in trusting, not just neighbours but in the process of life, in the universal laws and in the fact that no matter how dark a hole I felt I was in, there is always a chink of light, if you look for it- the secret is in how hard you look and itís often found where least expected. These are precious moments and to be honoured.

My co-ordination returned slowly and I found joy in the simple task like picking a pencil up with eyes and hand working together, my sense of feeling returned to my arms and legs and my mind became clearer. At my worst I lost the ability to spell or read simple words and when the neurologist asked me some simple arithmetic I answered from memory, I had lost the ability to work it out and even the concept of addition of numbers was something I could not comprehend in any way.

There were moments of great empowerment and insight in all the darkness and of course there were plusses too. One of these was my waist-line (now a distant memory). I cut down a denim skirt to show off my slim legs but so wanted a new jumper to wear. On my budget even the charity shops were out of my price range. That didnít stop me wanting a new jumper, Iíd get it some how and was it really too much to ask anyway, would it harm some vast eternal plan for a new jumper to manifest in some way. By that time so much else had happened I was open to anything. A friend of a friend visited with a large bag of unwanted clothes, would I be terribly offended if she offered them to me, she asked, no, not at all. And there inside the bag was my jumper, brand new and never worn, surplus to requirement and all mine now. At times like that I utter a silent prayer, you see for dreams to be answered you must first have the dream itself, then trust in the process and sit back and allow the universe to take care of the details. I didnít mind how or where the jumper came from, that bit was unconditional and I gloried in it and wore it with pride and a twinkle in my eye.

My old life had completely dropped away, the so-called friends melted in the heat of the situation, those that hung-on longer didnít like the new me and their disappointment was evident; I could no longer give them what they wanted and we parted company. Sometimes we have to completely lose sight of one shoreline before another comes into view, which it did, but oftentimes my faith was tested and then I visited that black hole of despair again, by now a very familiar place for me but I chose not to tarry there longer than absolutely necessary. I was tested and oftentimes felt I could not go the next round, I asked for the volume and speed to be turned down and for faith and courage to take me to the next step; my prayers were always answered and I quite literally lived to see the next day.

I had help from so many areas and had numerous and various alternative and conventional treatments, hospital stays and tests by the score. I was poked and prodded by men and women in white coats all over London and Kent and assured from a host of therapists that ëthis was ití and although Iím sure some of them helped a lot, my healing came from within. The medical profession offered no or little help and I read every scrap every published on MS, by now a confirmed diagnosis. But I do believe that inside is where all healing comes from, yes, others can help but we must all empower ourselves to go within, listen to our symptoms and bodies and take a leap of faith into the unknown called healing and wholeness. 

I redefined what I wanted in my life and set my path on a new course. I discovered my creativity, took a lover, laughed and lived in the moment and was spontaneous. I allowed myself to wonder at simple things in life and took time for nature and all her abundance and gifts. I asked myself some very difficult questions about my motives for being ill and what the benefit was (and believe me there are massive benefits, although often not perceived as such), I relied on my instinct, everything else had let me down and I went with the flow. 

A new life emerged and a way forward clear. Eventually I went back to college and studied for an HND that I passed with flying colours, a new low-key career but a job and a healthy future. I loved my life and myself too, unconditionally (most of the time, anyway) and my sense of self-worth improved I relaxed and laughed; compared to what Iíd been through there was nothing worth taking too seriously and I didnít need to please anyone except myself. 

Several years on my health is perfect, no numbness, full co-ordination all the time and boundless energy, but only for what I want to do. If I feel the need for approval I go within and ask for it from me, if I seek othersí then I ask why and what am I looking for from them-and then give it to myself. Iíve realised that itís only worth anything if it comes from me and this is just one of those lessons or conditioning that I learnt in my childhood and it really does NOT serve me anymore. Thereís nothing that I canít out grow or change if I want to. For years I thought of myself as a placid person but with awareness I saw that I was frightened of showing my anger and turned it all inwards, now how did that contribute to a diagnosis of MS, I wonder. I loose my temper now and rant and rave, but only momentarily then itís all over and out of the way. I no longer stew in a repressed battery acid of anger; I let it out (and itís often me Iím angry with anyway).

Last year I completed a charity trek for Mind in Guatemala. The longest day was up at 3am, walking by 3.30 straight up a volcano, a 1,550 meter ascent and at 11am I was sitting on the top surveying the view below (going down was interesting too taken at a medium gallop), in the evening we ate, drank and danced. Many of the other trekkers didnít manage it all, but I did and was so pleased with myself. Now you canít do that if you donít have a zest for life and are fit in body and mind.

I wouldnít wish my experience with MS on my worst enemy (as the saying goes, and to my knowledge I donít have one) but it has enhanced my life and changed it out of all recognition very much for the better, thank goodness.  

These days I help othersí with their healing and journey to wholeness, now thatís something that really is rewarding and if in reading this you feel constricted, unhappy, unfulfilled, sick or ill and need to ëtake the lid offí and peer inside your issues, let me encourage you to do so. Itís a difficult and sometimes painful journey but the rewards are riches beyond measure, and once there is even the smallest chink in the bottle the genie will be out and thereí no going back.

Good luck with your journey to wholeness and remember the route is of your own finding, and have faith that it is there. God Bless to you all. 2003-10-09
6 Spirit Rescue & Healing - Tonbridge Lorraine Alder Work completed by One Heals One Practioners- Gary Blanford and Lorraine Alder


House clearance, Spirit rescue, Free will therapy & Psychic Readings -Tonbridge 04.06.04

First felt some of the houseís negative energy problems came from its history and its very foundations.
Therefore, we began our clearance in the cellar. The cellar had a negative line of energy running through it and gave both of us a sick feeling. I began to link in with this energy and clairvoyantly saw a track running along the cellar a pulley system for building materials.  Then one spirit in particular showed himself to me and I linked in with him. He was very angry about how he had been treated. I got a sense that they thought he was careless and blamed him for some misfortune. Feelings were running high.
This man was sad, angry and had a great dislike for his boss. Then I got the sense of him losing his life here on the site. A head injury either from a fall or a blow to the head. From this head injury he died and left his physical body, emotionally still angry and seeking revenge and I feel he blamed his boss for his death. 
I was given the name Thomas for this unfortunate man.  His spirit became earth bound locked (without a sense of time) into emotions of hate, anger and resentment. He especially hated his boss Mc Fadden or Mc Finnegan (the sound of name given to me for the boss). 
After Thomas ës death they continued to build the villas. However, not completing the cellar of this house and I feel this maybe linked to Thomas ës death.

The spirit of this man wanders the garden and areas of the house. He is felt strongly in the cellar, basement and the childrenís bedroom. The spirit often observed the familyís little boy. The little boy I was aware could see this earth bound spirit at times. He felt most unhappy around the father of the family as he was reminded of his boss.

Description of the spirit Thomas ñ Light brown hair a slight wave to it and brushed back. Weathered features with a tanned complexion and he his around 39 years old. Medium to slim build very strong. Wearing brown trousers, braces, a shirt with rolled up sleeves and boots.
Sometime later..
After cleansing the house/negative energy line from cellar to loft we sat in meditation and again linked into the spirit of Thomas, we had sense of a relationship that he had didnít work out and he was quite a lonely man emotionally. However we linked into the love he had for his mother and a dog he was very fond of. His mum and the dog drew close to him from the spirit world offering love and healing. I witnessed Thomas in the light. I believe Thomas has now left this trapped state of being and is now receiving healing from loved ones in the spirit world. Should he ever wish to revisit the house he would have a totally different mindset and understanding of his life-he is now healed of all anger.







Cleansing each room

Basement and ConservatoryÖ

Basement - the energy here was of quite low vibration and requires uplifting. 
We did a thorough cleansing in the basement and in the conservatory.
More joyful things are needed to be brought into theses areas such as a quartz crystal, plants (ferns give a wonderful vibration) and maybe sunflowers (photoís of sunflowers /artificial ones or of something else joyful and bright would do).
Suggest maybe hiring if possible someone to do the ironing 2 to 4 hours a week would lift the mundane pressure.
The conservatory needs to be opened up more when sunny and beautiful music played here or a water feature and possibly rose quartz crystal (pink) would each help to achieve a sense of calm and love.

Crystalís Ö.for positive energy.

We all have quartz around us every day without realizing it. Quartz is used within industry because of its ability to transform energy.
It was discovered in the 1800ís that if you applied electrity to quartz it vibrated in a regular consistent pattern so much that we learned to tell the time by it.

By having quartz in our personal space we can directly benefit because of its ability to transform negative energy into a more harmonious energy. Place quartz within your daily environment, were you sleep, on your desk at work or on your computer. Quartz will help reject negative energies say of anyoneís bad moods. 
Interesting studies have been shown that when held in the hand for a period of 30mins there is a measurable increase in alpha brain waves which indicate is helpful in meditation.
I have mentioned the crystals more in this report, as I sense the lady of the house has natural ability and latent understanding of crystal energy. They would work beautifully within this home.

Kitchen..

Felt this was the space that provided more a sense of lightness and cleansing energy for the lady of the house. Even though worries are often expressed here a greater understanding of ones life journey would help with the worries (low energy).
Given less busy mundane circumstances she would enjoy creative cooking and entertaining. Suggestions continue to play music in here and read books of light (wisdom) on the balcony. Take up a creative course one that inspires you and take up a dance workshop this would increase personnel energy and would be very healthy. Continued trips to the sea to recharge energies are recommended.



Dining Room

Got a sense of a study not a dining room at first and was sure the energy here was of stress and the stress created here contributed to the health issue of the man of the house.
I was informed it was just previously a study/work area.
We did a clearing of this energy. Now suggest the work load has to be shared and feel the universe is providing someone with potential to help with the businessís paperwork etc More delegation of work is essential for health and the man of the house would benefit greatly from a group outdoor sport activity (involving water would be ideal). A trip to the gym once a week and a night out once or every two weeks would address the much-needed balance to the familyís lives. 
Suggest a babysitter is employed for the evening out and future evening courses.

LoungeÖ

A more peaceful energy but not having long enough times for relaxation.

We cleared the energy in this room and would like music to be played in this area and it to be used for meditation or quiet thinking times and reading. The children cannot be kept out of this room too much as this would cause tension. The more they arenít allowed something the more they want. 
However, if the children were allowed in this room but only to colour (with coloured pencils) or read and do more constructive/medative things such as jigsaws. Then this would allow for a family meditative room. Chess set for the adults and a plastic chess set for the children or family board games. Something like connect four whilst the children are young.
Furthermore, the children should allow sometime for the adults in the evening to relax. There are no worries for the child in their room alone the energy is all good there now. Maybe they can listen to a story tape/cd just for children that are positive and calming. Suggest buy an angel poster or statue for their room just to remind you that angels will always protect them and itís only fears that suggests they are not protected.


Cleared the hall and front door areas.

Upstairs clearedÖ.

Bathroom and toilet and Master bedroom, childrenís room, spare room and loft.

The above areas were cleared nicely.
Even though the bad energy line and the earthbound spiritís unhappiness was felt and affected the family please note:- the family were always spiritually in control however, they just needed to believe in their own positive power. 
The negative influences were felt and had an effect on the family I feel due to other circumstances. Such as - a change in lifestyle (moving house), taking on the task of restoring the house, low energy/tiredness, depression and worries all lead to the build up of negative energies.

Negative energies are expressed our lifeís as ill health, things going wrong, tension and bad luck.

Healing the individuals affected.

Each personal healing went well and the family can maintain their good energies through positive mindsets, learning to deal with stress/going more with the flow and receiving the occasional healing. Been aware of how one feels, negative thoughts and learning techniques on how to combat the blues. 
All the above information mentioned is to help you understand that you have the power to change any circumstance for the better. 

We feel you have a beautiful and unique home and this can now be enjoyed without fear. We sometimes have to go through hard times to discover are true inner spirit.
We wish you every success and happiness in your lifeís journey. 2005-01-22
10 Doors Open.......... Lorraine Alder Living With Spirit.....

I had just got my eldest boy to school and my youngest boy to his nursery for a couple of hours. Now I had just enough time to go supermarket shopping without the children. If I took them both shopping together sitting them in the double trolleys, they would get up to all sorts of mischief and fight the whole time!

Arriving home after the shop I took couple of bags from the car and opened the front door, going through the hall into the kitchen I heard a young girls voice sayingÖ.î Doors Open ì. 
This amazed me, as I knew the house was empty. I paused for a moment, and then I brushed it off and went back outside for more shopping but this time I looked around to see if any children were near the house, yet all was quiet.

So back through the hall and very clearly againÖ I heard the girls voice by no mistake the words  ì Doors Open ì and this time it seemed to come from the top of the stairs.
 I decided to go upstairs and look round the house. I was nervous but it was a childís voice so I investigated alone.
I found no one.

I pondered on the words doors open, my front door was open, but what did it mean?

Just recently I had been wondering what to do now both my boys were almost school age and just recently strange things had been happening a bit more than usual around us.

As I child I saw spirit people, Iíd wake up in the middle of the night to see a lady walk across the room and through the wall to the next house. If I call for my mum she would say I was most likely dreaming. But Iíd see other spirit and most of the time I would keep them to myself and think deeply about such things, and ponder them. 
I had a very strong sense that I had lived before and sometimes Iíd wake up crying about Germany and what had happened to the Jewish people and others such as the gypsies in their country. I was always terrified that they were after me. 
Has I got older the manifested spirit people got less yet I would have flashes just like movies that would come before my eyes of past lifeís or I see future things.

 Iíd always be holding conversations with someone in my head and I could ënot always remember what we were talking about but I was told things about people and situations. 

Once when my eldest boy was just a baby I put him into the car and was driving him to the local toddler group and I just heard myself saying to someone in my head ì Well okay then along as itís only a little bump.í
Then a few minutes later I was in a right filter to turn and a car crashed straight into the back of me.
The driver of the other car was very upset and worried and I remember saying to him donít worry itís only a little bump!  We were all fine.
This sort of spirit interaction has always been apart of my life - it was always the way. It happens most when I was in that ìday dream state ì and if you knew me then, that was a lot of the time.
I never thought that I could really understand these things or even work with this strange ability.

However, since I heard those words Door Open things really began to go bumpÖÖÖ.

A book fell off the self in the study, as I picked it up it was a book on Spiritualism, my cousin Diana had lent me. Lent been the operative word, I called her immediately and asked her why she had leant me the book.
She said that I had her book for two years and she and her husband Peter were wondering when Iíd get around to reading it. 
ëBut why did you give me a book on Spiritualismî? Do you see things Diana? I bravely asked.
Yes she said and did you know Peterís a medium and we knew one day you would read it and begin to develop your abilities.

Oh God, they knew some how, about these weird things that happened to me. It made me feel very scared because up until now spirit and their influence in my life were just My Private Daydreams. 
Somehow sheíd made them real ñ how scary!

My family on my mumís side are from Romany Gypsies but I didnít really know them that well. However, on my dadís side of the family they all had a ghost story to tell, each seemed to have had some ghostly experience yet none of them would wish to work with it or even understand it. It was just a one off things to them and they wouldnít look at it in any depth.


Just a day after the girlís voice and book incident my friend showed me an advertisement of a Medium ship demonstration held at the local Development Centre.
We went along and as I was sat listening to the medium I began to see in my minds eye the spirit she was linking to and giving messages from, it was brief, I glimpsed these spirits as if a door opened and then closed.

The next week I went alone to the Development Centres monthly meeting, where I first met Sarah founder of One Heals One. The medium Sheila Appleton invited us that night to join a development circle.
*(Read story - How One Heals One got started).
At one of our first development circles I kept seeing this little girl spirit watching and smiling at me, she only looked at me in the whole group.
 She is very petite has dark hair, green eyes and a beautiful smile almost fairy like. She seemed to be there each time it was circle night and I would say in my mind ìWho are you?í 
On the third meeting I her saying ìitís me mummyî. I couldnít catch her name and sheís calling me mummy!
A wave of emotion came over me and I began to calculate her age and realized she was my very own daughter that I had miscarried 11years ago. 

She was growing up in the spirit world and had come to encourage me to develop. With help from a psychic friend I was told her name is Katie a name I really liked all those years ago.

 When she visits me now she brings along my dads dad, a granddad that died before I was born. My spirit family supporting me from the other side means so much to me in my development. 

So thank you Katie for calling Doors Open to me that day because I understand now you were referring to the Spiritual Door that was opening for me. I wished to learn, took the guidance and walked through the door.


God Bless all spirit helpersÖ


I am still on fully on my journey of self and spiritual development.

8 Spirit Rescue, Healing & Earth Energies - Lyme Regis Lorraine Alder Work completed by One Heals One Practioners ñ Lorraine Alder, Gary Blanford and Sarah Livesey

Spirit Rescue, Freewill Therapy, Healing & Earth Energies.
Day One

12.12.04 Upper Lyme

On the way down to the location and before at home I felt the spirit of a man who wished to be acknowledged. He was an old man who was a little stocky with slightly thinning hair. He passed over with heart problems. He linked strongly with his son and very much wanted him to know that he was taking great interest in his life now and was helping in anyway he could.  He appeared in a white shirt unbuttoned at the collar and dark trousers with braces. This was a good sign, as I know the spirit world was ready to assist us.

Upon arrival at the home I felt a lot of history and active earth energies around the house and the grounds. In the house there were two strong sensations that cut the house in two.

The old part of the house where the front door is situated off the drive included two bedrooms, bathroom, hall and lounge area, and conservatory. This section of the house emanated lot of residue energy - layers of recorded passed energy (history).  There is a spirit of a lady that wanders the grounds and comes in visitation into the home. She resided in the back bedroom, the room facing the lawn - the back garden. 
She had an important job to do and that was linked in service with the old Manor House. This spirit lady served the owners wife acting as her main carer and confidant.
The lady of the manor house had given birth to a child and had become very ill after the birth. Our spirit friend took care of the Lady of the Manor, forever watchful over her bed. One night a fever took over the lady and a doctor was sent for from the town. At this point I feel this links the house to this memory when horse and rider were called for to get help. It was a time when the main house kept horses in their stables (old section of the house may have been the stables). Unfortunately, I am now shown the horses pulling a hearse, a funeral, I feel the lady of the house passed the night of the fever.

Our spirit friend roams different buildings associated with the Manor House. She watches over people as they sleep hoping one day she would be vigilant enough to save someone as she felt she should have saved the lady she was entrusted to look after. The name Mary and Rosemarie features around this spirit ñ she was someone in her fifties a spinster who had given a lifetime of service. She could be a cold character, serious and little snobbish. She was hard on herself and others sometimes. She took great pride in her work and was well known in the town and received peopleís respect.

We could do a spirit rescue on this lady if the owners wished, but her spirit causes no trouble, she just sits in the chair in the back bedroom doing needlework and watches. She will eventually give up her vigil and her spirit loved ones will come for her to cross her over to the light; she has no concept of time.



 A Summary of the Two Bedrooms, Bathroom and Hall

A strong sense of horses in this part of the house as well as childbirth, illness then the funeral. Not sure if someone died in this part of the house but our spirit lady brings that memory from the Manor House days. I feel there is a lot of 16th Century energy/drama recorded here.
*An Energy Clearance of these rooms was carried out and a healed, protected and harmonious energy was obtained.

The Lounge and Conservatory

The lounge had more of the old stable and Manor House energy link, but no main event struck me at this time. Felt more the previous owners energies. 
The conservatory I feel was only used occasionally by the previous tenants and more by the lady possibly to do her artwork in here. It wasnít a particular good feeling in the conservatory. Fear was felt here and a sense of some night time experience by the previous male tenant. He may have seen lights (alien) in the grounds and this made him feel very vulnerable. He was a bit of a recluse, fearful and superstitious.
I also get a tragic spirit girl who would come through the conservatory to try to seek help yet she was a shy spirit. She brings a very traumatic experience with her. 
Upon our first meditation to link with the energies of this location this spirit girl was the first to come through bringing many flies with her. Please read the section on The Meditation for more details on this spirit and the crossing.

*An Energy Clearing of this room was carried out and a healed, protected and more harmonious energy was obtained.

Kitchen

Another strong different feeling, a faster running energy from under the floor, such as water. 
A lower pulling sensation at your legs and a light breezy feeling around your head.   
This is the recorded energy of a fast running stream here at one time, and whatís left today is a slower/smaller stream that runs under this part of the house.
The energy in the kitchen is fine to live with. However, if you are out of balance or out of sorts then in here you will tend to feel dizzy. 
The previous tenants especially the male would often feel ill in here and need to sit down. I feel the man had lower abdominal pain and often felt dizzy in the kitchen. Also, the way they placed the furniture in the kitchen caused the chi (energy) not to flow well. 
The placing of furniture to allow energy to flow nicely around the house adds to the harmony in the home. You can read all about this in books that specialize in this subject Feng Shui. Ask yourself can you walk around your home with ease? Are there objects that irritate you ñ then note these feeling build up a negative energy.

*An Energy Clearing of this room was carried out and a healed, protected and a more harmonious energy were obtained.
 Master Bedroom

Again this energy pulled at you and made you focus on under the floor. I can only describe it as vortex of energy, a spiral just at the bottom of the bed that goes deep under the ground. In reality there could be a well under here. Or a main point where lay lines cross.  A lay line was felt coming into the room diagonally at the outer corner of the room following a straight line through the shower of the en suit and out into the front drive. 
It is of major pool of earth energy. This energy pool I feel needs further investigation.
If we tap into this power what could it be used for? 

Suggestions
Possibly used to gain strong communication with the earth, the spirit world/higher planes or used for healing/manifestation. A point like this would magnify spirit activity and would link into mother earth activity.

A spirit of a Roman guard was positioned by the door leading to the garden as if to protect something here. Could there be Roman artefacts here and was it a sacred site even before the Romans?
Iím sure with more work on this area we could uncover much more. Suggest focus on this area at any future visits.
*An Energy Clearing of this room was carried out and a healed, protected and a more harmonious energy were obtained. 
*The pool of energy has a lid on it until we have more knowledge.

The Utility and Upstairs Bedroom Halls and Landing Areas

Whilst upstairs in the bedroom I had the sense this area was not used for what it was intended, it was meant for someone, who became too ill to use it. This extension did not really work out. 
It was mainly used by the previous owners for storage. I felt the utility should have been more a mini kitchen.
The energy of a light haired fluffy cat was felt in this area of the house and the stairs and upper bedroom is where the cat spent most of its time.
No other strong energies featured in this part of the building, it had a natural feel to it.
*An Energy Clearance was carried out and a healed, protected and harmonious energy was obtained.

Other Worlds

Looking out of the houseís windows at the back your eyes are drawn to the tree line and you get a strong sense of alien interest. They may have already been sightings and Iím sure there will be in the future - for those who are sensitive and are able to see them. 
The energy lines either draw them or they are just more detectable on lay line land.

 12.12.04 The Meditation

We were lead to a small building positioned at the corner of the garden wall, where a fire and candles were lit to provide a place to do our link with the spirit world. It was just the right atmosphere a Buddha statue, cushions, candles and warmth from the fire. We didnít have a sense of time in this building but it was now evening time.

Upon first linking in a young girl showed herself to me. She had shoulder length mousey coloured hair and was only about sixteen. She was a shy girl who had learning difficulties and her main job was to be of service to a house.
She showed me her room that she shared with three or four other girls. Then she gave me a very scared feeling and I saw a man who was often on the warpath to find this girl. Her name may have been Jesse /Jessica. She often did things wrong in the house and was beaten by this angry man, The name of the man came through as Mr Batley or Bailey - couldnít get the name too clearly.

This girl didnít like her life and would sometimes intentionally do mean things to the others, such as break things of other people or putting things in their food that wasnít pleasant then she would giggle to herself.

The way she behaved caused lots of trouble for herself, she wasnít bright and was often found out. She would hide from the man who would beat her, her mind in a kind of hysteria half frightened and half laughing.

In the end she showed me herself in a under ground place with a bricked wall and tunnel - this felt like a well. She was in a lot of pain and her legs were injured. Her legs were bleeding, she had no shoes or warm clothes, she was in her nightdress. Hungry, in pain, cold, wet, dirty and very sad. She became transfixed on the flies that crawled over her blooded legs and she made them her friends. This was where she died and I believe her body can be found in a well still on the land. Her soul wanders the area trying to find peace.

As I continued with link in I was also impressed by another spirit of a man in his mid 30ís from a different era. He showed me the track on the land that has a bridge on it. I was transported to a century of top hat and capes and taverns. This track was a main commuting route into Lyme Regis and it's past was recorded in the energy. Many horses and travellers would use this old road. He drew my attention to an incident at night that took place on the bridge. A group of young riders in their twenties of an unsavoury nature had followed this man here to beat him and bully him. They knocked him off his horse and kicked him until he was dead. I had the feeling the dark hair young man was jealous of this mans family life. He persuaded his friends to go along with the bullying and killing of this poor soul.
I watched his story unfold but was influenced by the spirit of the girl again. She wanted help and I could now hear actual flies manifested in the room we were meditating in. I knew I had to discuss the girl with my colleagues and come out of the meditation; there was so much in the atmosphere.

Before coming out of the my meditation/link I was shown the lines of earth energies that run through this area, It was a group of five lines (lay lines) that run through the land and three of them cross each other a certain points. 
*See lay line diagram.



Spirit Rescue

We discussed our meditations with each other and we all linked with the girl spirit and agreed we would carry out a spirit rescue.

After viewing the girlís unfortunate events we took her back in mind to a more happy time in her life. She went back to a time when she was around six years old and with her mother. A peaceful feeling was felt and the girlís love for her mother was strong.
We got the understanding that the mother died whilst the girl was still young, the seemed to have died in childbirth.

A door was opened between the two worlds and her mother came to collect her. Healing, love and compassion for this soul was sent to the girl though out the crossing to help bridge the two worlds. We asked the flies to go with her into the light. Upon this the flies in the room began to fly into our candles and we could hear them burning.
It was a successful crossing and I do feel the girl may come back to this location again but in a very different state of mind (healed & at peace) and only to witness and to offer her assistance in recovering her body.

We finished by choosing some native medicine cards to reveal their wisdom.

Bridge to heaven	came up which very much describes the place on all level even the current owner wishes to build a bridge on his land.
Fire	was another card that we felt a significant fire had happened here.
Horse	a symbol of centuryís passed and of moving forward with mystery of his place.
Energy	was the last card and it spoke about clearing negative energies of which this land truly needed.

* An Energy Clearing was carried out in this out building.

This concluded our first dayís work.
 Day Two

13.12.04 Dowsing Rods and Lay Lines

Up and out into the land surrounding the house. We were lead to the track the horseman had shown us the previous night. It confirmed the feelings of the male spiritís experience and plenty of residue (past recorded) energy, high emotions on the bridge and the constant use of people walking to market at the main town. A traderís route.

We then approach the Vodafone tower and felt it was positioned on one of the main lay lines. We planned to divert the energy high above the level of the house and garden to divert any static build up affecting the residents. We achieved this later that night.

We then took a left across the land and could see where water had featured in the past. This was one of the reasons for so many lay lines as well as the busy energy routes and a history of emotional events.

We continued our walk and I began to cough at a certain point and it wasnít until I did the same thing on the way back we realised this was the energy of fire. Fire of the past. 
I began to get a sense of a candle lit procession; some people at the front seemed to be in robes. It looked like a pilgrimage; many would walk from one church to another church in a pray-full mind. This type of event can create a strong line of energy - another lay line. We mapped out the lay lines on our walk; we could sense good or bad energy. One running along the centre of the land and through the neighbourís house was of a contaminated energy and we lined up to channel light to clear this line approximately 1.15pm on Monday 13th December 2004.

This clearing will have a beneficial effect on the people in the house and the land.
Further along towards the edge of the land we had a feeling of buildings under the earth that could be uncovered and would be from Roman and Medieval times.
This spot of land was of great activity through out the ages. Druids linked with Stonehenge and Glastonbury were once active on this land as I heard familiar buzzing, just like the one I heard at the portal of Stonehenge. It continued to be an important sight for druids and pilgrims. It does seem strange however, that there is very little history to be found about the place. More research is needed and we all felt there could be some sort of conspiracy to hide some of its history.
At the very end of our walk in a wooded pine area this felt at first very alien with not the best energy it gave me a pain in my side that wore off soon as I got more used to the energy. A Roman link was felt here also. 
It seemed a gateway on all levels, between other worlds, an ancient commuter route and place armies marched through to go to battle.

I used a ditital voice recorder to document my work and upon play back, cildrens voices were clearly heard yet no children were on this private land at the time. 
They were clearly the sounds of spirit voices. Another amazing assignment.

House Clearance, Spirit Rescue, Freewill Therapy, Earth Energies & Psychic Readings.
11th and 12th September

On arrival we were met in the drive and were told the land was once occupied by travellers and I got a strong feeling they left there presence and it came to me that the owner was a ancestral link with gypsies and that his gift of psychic sensitivity was passed down to him.
Then upon entering the property one could feel the people who lived here were good people, creative and aware. The general energy was of tension and worry and direction was needed.

The Lounge
The Energy ImpressionsÖÖ..
Felt more time to relax, as a whole family was needed.
Fun plays a big part in the overall familyís well being. Watching TV with a treat -throwing sweets at each other and not all would sit on the sofa together, I felt one would always sit on the floor with the dog.
The lady of the house still felt the room needed a finishing touch ñ maybe something special over the fireplace.  I was picking up on these feelings. 
There had been tears recently, an argument and worry about things that have been said to others. 
 A fear of others not understanding them as people; seem to run through all four family members. The family were more spiritually aware than they realised and felt different to the average person. Their family in spirit and spirit guides were always around them trying to best guide and influence them, they have to learn how to clear and calm the mind so they can be guided by thoughts and they should trust their hearts (feelings).
The corner by the door was a vortex of energy (a doorway for spirit to come in) also felt the corner right of the fireplace was a place for spirit to visit and look in on the family. A family member made their presence known. This was a slim man a smoker and would be someone who would pick up things from empty houses and sell them. He had a cart; he links with London a bit of a rag and bone man a strong character. Then someone else came in who also smoked but he said he didnít pass over with smoking just that he had a problem with his lungs. These spirits were lending support to the family and I felt this family was of great interest to the spirit world and this usually means they can grow themselves and help others ñ thatís why the spirit world are most interested in the progress of each one.
Just as we were about to clear the room of all lower energies a small old lady in a short black cloak (hood over her head to hide herself) shot out of the room off into the garden. The feelings that came with her was that she was an earth bound spirit who often came into this house and other houses to be nosey and look for things to take. I then knew the family had experienced things been moved or things missing. The mother and daughter seemed to have felt this presence in the home and even caught glimpses of the energy in the corner of their eye.  The earth bound energy was very unhappy and misunderstood also mentally not very well. She was connected to the land not the family.

The framed print in the lounge reflected a person who was creative, dramatic and a beautiful spirit living in a world of people who couldnít relate to this. I felt this was the inner spirit of the lady of the house and that she needs to express her very creative side of her nature and mix with more like-minded people.

We proceeded to clear the room, lift the energy to a positive and relaxed state, bringing in light and healing. We then place symbols of Love Light and Protection around the room. 

Suggestions for this room would be allow the chi (energy) to flow a beautiful gold mirror on the fireplace reflecting light, a clear quartz crystal on the TV and a plant near the door thatís not used that leads to the hall. A vase with beautiful artificial red roses for the coffee table, with red cushion accessories for the sofa would bring in warmth to the room. The roses would be a symbol of love, blessings and protection from Keithís Nan always.



Healing The FamilyÖÖÖÖÖ

The daughterÖ
Worries about been out of control and does not yet understand her own energy/power yet. Feel she is going through learning experiences - discovering herself, what feels right and what doesnít. A giver and rescuer but needs to deal with her own needs before can help others; otherwise she will only hurt herself.  A very intelligent person who would be very good working in law or teaching. She would have to follow a career that is challenging  or she would get bored. Boredom would be quite destructive for her, as she needs to express herself. She needs to be creative and could easily learn to play music given the right teacher. 
Using her energy correctly would be healthy and attract great opportunities. If she expressed her inner spirit by swimming (keeping fit), joining an art or music group and start to look towards the future. A career in Law or medicine (something of great learning) then she would meet more inspirational people and begin to see and share her many gifts. A wonderful interesting life would open up and she should have no fear of success. However, she can be easily distracted and must learn to discipline her own mind. Meditation or yoga would help her understand this.
Poetry and creative writing will also be a future asset.
The daughter needs to have her own space out in nature for quite moments would be ideal - connect to birds and the energy out in nature has a calming effect.
Lower teeth may need a brace and had to heal a weak ankle.
Main healing would be self-love and acceptance. Recommend read Diana Cooper Books for working on the mind. 
Very psychic may develop this later.
Beautiful aqua marine Aura ñ a writer.
In good time Australia would be good for the daughter and maybe her boyfriend would go with her.


* All Read
Self Worth and Confidence 
Self Worth bestows as sense of confidence, success and an ability to love oneself /others correctly.
Decide on clear boundaries and limits for yourself and your family. Firmly decline to let others neither step over them or manipulate you, nor step over your loved ones boundaries. This will earn respect.
With true Self Worth, you radiate a golden aura, which enfolds others and makes them feel good about themselves too. You donít have to bend over backwards for others; they wonít really respect this and ultimately wonít grow themselves.


The MotherÖÖÖÖÖÖ
Healing energy went to right shoulder and knee. The shoulder links to having to do some of the father role with the children sometimes and the knee is frustration with seeming impossible situations. Past history of knee liked with raising her son a time of growth for her spirit.
Extra iron in the diet is needed for feeling tired and relaxing massages would help with tension.
Feel she is now beginning to gain more confidence in what she is and is now seeing her own gift and liking herself a lot more. She is at a real growing time and needs to find her true path. Lots of lovely blue and pinks in her aura shows a great teacher and sales person. Could teach groups of people and be successful selling property etc. Had an irrational fear of purple.
Needs to be in the sun as this is healing and calming for her. 
She is attracted to diamonds, this reflects her soul a bright light and multifaceted.
The job she is in is no longer good for her and a change in career is needed.  Taking up reiki and developing spiritually will be of great strength to her and she will begin to take charge of her destiny. Learning about colours and there vibrations would enhance her awareness. She needs to meet more inspirational people because some of the people around her are to stuck and boring. Already good at psychology and will learn more in this field. Potentially can help many people.

Australia would be good for the mother and her family when the time is right.


The SonÖÖÖÖÖ

Wonderful soul lots of light and love from spirit for him. Lot of green in his aura ñ a healer of others but also needs balance in his life.
May feel tired a lot because not using his energy properly. Be creative with colour.
Often feels a little alone and different needs to have more confidence. Very beautiful smile a gift - when the boy smiles it positively helps others in a healing way.
Links with Africa and the majestic energy of that continent, also Australia would be good for the boy.
Has a sportsman like energy and should take up team sports. He has lots going for him but easily gets dishearten by the people around him. Therefore, he needs to over come any fears and begin to widen his comfort zone.
Joining a sports clubs just for training to start with and a theatre group as acting would be amazing for his personnel growth. He would be a successful actor as all the best actors were very shy people e.g. Huge Grant 
On expanding his horizons the universe will reward him with some new friends and a soul mate.
Reading about how we create the energy around us and understanding the Universal Laws will help Anthony become more powerful and help create a wonderful life for himself, which he deserves.
In later life I see he will travel and help people in different countries.
I also see a more adventurous spirit soon even a motorbike.



The FatherÖÖÖÖÖ..

Healing pointís sinus, needed clearing of head, shoulders and back. Reasons for these pains  - Supports a lot of people and this means sometimes own health and family time suffer. Needs to hand back a lot of the problems of others back to them to deal with and then allowing them to grow?
Sensed trauma with the thumb and that he found it hard to express his own emotions sometimes. Not many people realise that he has problems because they are too concerned about themselves.
Massages often would be of great benefit to him and extra vitamin C. 
Indigestion type feeling with him and herbal teas first thing on a morning may help relax this area and more fish than red meat in the diet. Cutting down on smoking, less coffee and coke would have many health benefits. These diet changes should ease the lower back pain.  
Has a great sense of humour but is sometimes misunderstood by some people. Watching comedy programmes as a family would be great to lift the spirits.
Unique aura with goldís, blues and silvers a gifted soul. This person would understands there is much more to this world and has a connection with the stars/cosmos. Has many highly evolved souls guiding him from spirit such as a Native American guide, Tibetan Lama, Greek architect and Egyptian boy.
Amazing just a little meditation and discipline for him to be able to gain the advice of these great beings.
The father has the ability to become a very good medium and help lots of people. Believe in your own gifts and power and know you will be guided to make the best decisions for the family. Even when things donít go the way expected, its because spirit have a better plan for your future. Example - The coffee shop in the village would have certainly lost money.
Selling the house and moving is likely at the right time and thereís a time soon you can relax and have the joy you deserve.


The Clearing of the rest of the houseÖÖÖÖÖ.

Kitchen
This was cleared/protected well and quite easily. Only suggestion is that more healthy things are displayed like fruit and healthy cereal bar snacks. Less coke, tea and coffee and more fresh juice, milk and herbal drinks. Water energised with a rose quartz crystal or if prefer a little mint in the water would be better for all.

Utility Room
This area was cleared and protected well. Suggest houseplants to help keep the electrical equipment working well.
Downstairs toilet, hall and master bedroom
The energy flows really very well already within this home and doesnít require too many changes.
Only suggestion here that the master bedroom has a music system (for spiritual/relaxing music) subtle lighting and candles/fragrances to create a peaceful romantic energy.

The Sons room

Good clearance and protection carried out. Seeing the stars at night was very significant.
UFO ës interested in the people in this area. Nothing to worry about itís always happened; just not everyone can see them.

The daughterís room

Good clearance and protection carried out. Suggest Rose Quartz crystal for the energy of Unconditional Love - Self Love. 

Spare room

Good clearance and protection.
Suggestion made to use as a meditation room. Clear room, soft cushions, crystals, candle and meditation cdís played also music. Take a Notebook to write down any problems, mediate and then allow for the answers to come through. The more you practice this the easier to be guided.


All house and gardens cleared.
Rock salt around the house plus visualizing a pyramid of white light around the house will stop any negative energies calling in to have a look around. The energy on the land and the good energy of the family do attract spirit. These spirits are good spirits who will be allowed into the light (your home) but only to bring love and blessings. Because of the psychic gifts of the family they may see them but you have only ask them to go and they will.
Always remember you have the power here and call upon help if needed anytime to the God most high of the universe,
Fear only comes from lack of understanding.



Spirit Rescue

Upon our meditation in the spare room we found it quite easy to link into the spirit of the old lady.
She said her house was at the back of this one and her son had left her and not bothered about her. She didnít know if he or anyone cared about her. Felt her family rejected her as a child, no one really understood her.
She did have a relationship but this didnít last.
She was very bitter and didnít like people much, a recluse and now senile. She gave the name Margaret and spoke of travellers on the land. I connected with the history of the land, mining of some sort for heavy materials and horses. Blacksmiths and more running water across the area.
Margaret liked to take things that caught her eye. She once stole some silver and was always searching for food, apples etc.  People were angry with her when they saw her because they knew she would steal and she often swore and cursed them. She was at one point chased by two men who hurt her and she fell. An injury to the head all helped in her poor health and passing, too scared to cross over to the light she remained earth bound, still carrying out her miserable routine.
However, our guide came to Margaret and she was attracted to the healing energy from Gary and she and myself remained in our circle of light.
We listened to her worries and complaints about people and then gently helped recall a good memory. Her spirit mind briefly recalled a fire - her home.
Her memories stopped at an age of around 7 year. She was a young girl with a new dress her mother made. She feels happy when her mother said looks beautiful and this fills her with joy. Her mother was normally cold towards her. At this point when her heart was full of love the door opened between the two worlds. Her mother stepped forward in spirit and called her with her arms open. Margaret ran to her as a child and crossed into the healing light. It was very moving to see. God bless her soul.

We believe Margaret crossed on the12th September 2004 and if she did visit her old life it would be as a spirit healed and good.
    
Information on Lay Lines to be forwarded asap.

14 Sue (  Business owner ) I am truly grateful and thrilled to have found Sarah's name on Caroline Myss' web site. 
Sarah's archetypal and energy reading provided me with numerous invaluable insights, 
unique perceptions and connections that I would never ever have discovered myself, 
despite what feels like endless reflection and inner work. 
Sarah's finely attuned senses were astoundingly accurate and coupled with her natural 
warmth and gentleness, she helped me immensely during a deeply puzzling and worrying 
time in my life. 
If you're at all indecisive about which healer or teacher to work with, don't hesitate, 
Sarah's a great choice. 
Sue, Austria 0000-00-00
17 Minna R.Talvisto "Sarah is a life coach par excellence. She is brilliant at her work. All her coaching has been right on and accurate. She is truthful, thorough, firm, and gentle. I am forever thankful. - Minna from Dubai, UAE" 0000-00-00
18 Shanta I found Sarah via the Caroline Myss website. I am new to archetypes and am I 
ever glad I was guided to Sarah. Her detailed explanations of how the archetypes 
worked with me and within my life were so exact, it can't be coincidence  House 
after house, the information brought me insights that in my 48 years no one has 
been able to point out before. The truth was sometimes difficult to admit, but 
there it was, staring me in the face. I couldn't deny what was being 
transmitted.

Sarah was very attentive and detailed. I will have to review this information a 
few times to continue to pull the gems through. She has provided me with a map 
and instructions on guiding my life choices over the near future. I can't wait 
to step with confidence into my next decisions, now knowing the best choices for 
me.

Highly recommended. I'm considering doing a reading on a yearly basis to provide 
stepping stones into the New Year.

12 Indra (writer) I found Sarah Livesey when I was looking for a recommended student of Caroline Myss - someone who could offer up the same insights and make the same connections. Sarah's energy, intuitiveness, creativity and empathy have been invaluable to me at a very challenging period of my life - she has managed to open me up to my own greater potential and shown me concrete ways forward. 
Indra London 0000-00-00
13 Michelle  M.D Sarah did a ìprogressed archetype reading chartî for me, telling me what is going on right now and all I can say is, she is just amazing! 
Although it was recorded and sent to me via CD it was as if I was sitting with her in the living room having a real conversation. I enjoyed every minute! Her insights offer enormously rich information, providing lots to think about, identify and to work with. Iím really impressed by her intuitive skills ñ she just hit it right on! Some of the archetypes she picked were surprising to me and not at the same time. That really is the beauty having Sarah pick them, gets oneself out of the way ñ how super helpful is that!!! 
Will definitely work with her again and can only highly recommend her! 
Michelle 2009 USA 0000-00-00

The accuracy of her work is remarkably impressive as is the way in which she approaches using her God give spiritual-psychic gifts, talents, and abilitiess. Sarahís inspired confidence, highly attuned skills, and delightful humor resonates through her work as she generously shares her insights with you. öShe is an incredible person who passionately cares about helping others embrace all that resides deep within and all around them selves. Without reservation, I will continue to work with Sarah for she has provided me invaluable information on my own mystical spiritual journey. ì

15 Cate  ( Entreperner ) Meeting Sarah back in 2005 really did change my perspective on so many aspects of my life. Her accuracy was phenomenal and her insight astounding (at times making me question if indeed she had been attached to me during most of my life and Iíd missed it) . I was able to see and understand, for the first time, why events in our lives (both the ones you have loved and those you have loathed) are simply guiding us to the place we should be, which made accepting certain situations (loathed bits obviously) far easier and in doing so founded an inner strength and a formidable resolve (that Iím guessing she knew full well I possessed before I even sat before her). Whether concurring past events (nodding continually and hence admitting things youíd rather not) or considering those events ëthat willí come and squirming uncomfortably at times (ëOh noí and ëyou canít be serious?í ... in my case ... mixed liberally with ëbring it oní and ëwhen can I start?í) ... it really is futile to ignore the messages. 
Cate Entreperner Uk 0000-00-00
16 Cathy ( Business Owner ) I found Sarah Livesey whilst on my journey to fulfil my divine potential. 
Sarah spent a long time with me working on Archetypal patterns that comprise my Sacred Contract. The work was demanding and often frustrating. It took a great deal of commitment from Sarah and me, but so worth it. 

Sarah was patient whilst encouraging me to understand in detail and work through the important early stages. She pushed me when I needed it and watched over me as I sometimes struggled with the comprehension. 
And as the work with the Archetypes started to shed light on the little known corners of my soul she supported me and encouraged me. 
A truly amazing experience with a truly amazing individual. 
Many thanks, Sarah 
Cathy McFadden UK 0000-00-00
19 Guy I have been working with Sarah on metaphysical guidance with archetype work. I found it extremely useful and accurate. Sarah has a lovely personality and it is great fun to work with her. I'd recommend her without hesitation.

Guy, London 0000-00-00
20 Lela Sarah has  helped sooo much with my life journey for the past 5 years but where do I start  an essay for I know whatever we have done together with no doubt has been 100% helpful one thing is for sure and that is that without talking and knowing you are around over all this years it would have been very difficult for me to have kept my sanity!!

1 Reiki Reiki is a form of healing touch that conducts energy from the giver to the receiver. It is a holistic therapy in that it works on the mind, body and spirit by stimulating the body's own natural healing capacity. It can be used alone or with other treatments to help restore physical and emotional balance in the body. 1248
2 Aurora Magnetic Crystal Sound Healing Aurora Magnetic Crystal Sound Healing is a combination of four alternative therapies - Colour, Magnets, Crystals and Sound. The individual alternative therapies can be dated back to the ancient Egyptians and Chinese who used coloured essential oils for therapeutic massage and healing. Crystals and sound were used widely, and it is thought that Cleopatra wore magnets and crystals to keep her healthy and youthful. 

Aurora have seventy-eight beautifully hand decorated coloured bottles. Each bottle has relevant coloured crystals attached around the neck, and the bottle sits in a base that holds six magnets. The base is designed to hold a tuning fork that has a sound frequency relevant to the colour. The bottles can be filled with a base oil or aromatherapy oils for massage, or water for drinking purposes. The magnets magnify the effect of the healing powers within the crystals and also the vibration of each relevant sound and colour. Water and oil are very good conductors of this healing energy created from colour, magnets, crystals and sound. Once the water has been drunk or the oils massaged into the physical body, the energy within it can begin to work instantly through the physical body, thus putting back its natural magnetic balance. Each bottle is quite unique in its colours, crystals, sounds and magnetics because each bottle has different healing powers that vibrate at different healing frequencies. It is these healing frequencies that resonate with the same frequencies as those of the chakras. 2996
3 Spiritual Healing Guided healing from spirit 1064
4 Meditation Meditation is best understood as a state of mind which you can achieve and not an activity to be performed. You can become completely awake, alert and under full control of your senses and brain. But without thoughts or very few in the head and you should feel a sense of tranquillity or relaxation. Initially there could be other sensations because everybody is in a different condition when they learn to meditate.

True Meditation is natural and the body, brain and central nervous system is designed for it to occur.

With a little practice of Meditation for a few minutes, once or twice each day, it is not difficult to derive benefits in many areas of your life, particularly health. These come naturally as your nervous system develops more of its own inner qualities. 1124
5 Yoga Yoga is an ancient discipline concerned with developing a holistic healthy and harmonious lifestyle. It is a combination of physical and mental exercises which promote flexibility, reduce stress and increase stamina and strength. It can offer benefits that make your body stronger and healthier and calm your mind. 1018
6 Reflexology Reflexology is a science that deals with the principle that there are reflexes in the feet and hands that correspond to all the glands, organs and parts of the body. It is a simple, non-invasive, and effective form of healing.
A treatment lasts between 40 minutes and 1 hour. During the first visit, a case history is taken in order to assess where there may be possible imbalances or problem areas. The client is seated in some form of recliner chair or similar seated (or laying) position and asked to remove shoes and socks. Once the feet have been cleansed, the treatment starts with a gentle relaxation sequence which helps to relax the client and guide the therapist to any problem areas. 1100
7 Aromatherapy It is the art, and science, of using oils extracted from aromatic plants to enhance health and beauty, for psychological and physical well-being.
Most Aromatherapists will have a holistic approach to client consultation. This provides the information necessary to select the appropriate essential oils for the maximum therapeutic benefit. The selected essential oils are blended with a carrier/base massage oil to create a unique mix for each clientís individual needs. This Aromatherapy blend is usually applied to the skin with traditional body massage. Other massage techniques such as deep tissue work may also be used, depending on the Aromatherapistís practice and the clientís requirement. 1231
8 Emotional Freedom Technique This therapy 'taps' the body's 365 acupressure points to aid restoration of the body's energy flow. The technique was revised by a personal development coach called Gary Craig, who only used 11 of these points. It is this routine that is used by many of the worlds 3,000+ EFT practitioners. 
EFT practitioners describe their therapy as an 'emotional form of acupuncture'. A client is assisted in tuning in to their problem; the practitioner will then use fingertips to tap a map of points, and a series of affirmations to bring about balance. The technique is said to aid many conditions from Anxiety and stress, to phobias, compulsions and pain. 1180
9 Metaphysics Metaphysical therapy embraces the wisdom of the message handed down by the mystics of all ages. The basic message is that we are all part of the One Life that manifests itself in countless forms throughout creation, and those forms are all interconnected. Everyone still has this memory but for most of us it is buried deep in our psyche. How did this happen, you may ask?

This happened as a result of our conditioning and the belief of being bound by time.

Conditioning

An analogy with a new born baby may help us to understand.

Research has shown that a new born baby has no sense of separation between itself and the environment: it feels as one with the mother (as it felt in the womb). When the baby grows up we start to give it an identity in the form of  names (personal, family, location etc.) and possessions (toys, house, bicycle etc.) so gradually the baby is learning that it is separate from people and the environment. All of these identities are just labels and we do not even realize that we are slowly conditioning the childís mind. Religion and education contribute further to the conditioning of our mind. We become attached to these names and labels with the subsequent fear of loss. We are now a long way from the original state when the baby entered life.

Almost all of us have gone through this process of conditioning which has resulted in a sense of fragmentation within ourselves and separation from others i.e. not feeling connected.

Time

Again as a result of upbringing and education we have learned to recognize time as the binding factor in our lives. We have learned to remember the past and to speculate about the future.

We tend to carry the past within us as either pleasant or painful and we find it hard to let go of either. Why? Because we have turned our past experiences into who we think we are.

Speculation about the future can bring about hope or anxiety and neither is real. Why?

Because there is only one time and that is the present moment.

You remember the past in the NOW and you speculate about the future in the NOW. Anything you can ever do is in the NOW!

Metaphysical therapy

A metaphysical therapist assists clients on their journey home, i.e. to rediscover their true nature as is mentioned above. Clients are first of all invited to examine their conditioning in terms of thoughts and beliefs. Left unchecked our thoughts and feelings tend to run our lives and become our identities or ëstoriesí: ëmyí pain, ëmyí loneliness, ëmyí loss etc. Thus we are programmed to believe in a separate ëmeí. Through awareness of our attachment to limiting beliefs we are able to  release them. Freeing our conditioned mind also helps to release the fear of loss, including death.

Wouldnít that be a liberating experience!
