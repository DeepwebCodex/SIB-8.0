39 IJAIEM-2014-06-06-6 Implementation of Privacy-Preserving Public Auditing and Secure Searchable Data Cloud Storage First A. MsVaishali Patil , Second B. Prof. ArchanaLomte Dept of Computer,BSIOTR,pune India vashali_patil2013@yahoo.com vashali_patil2013@yahoo.com Accepted INR 2500 10-Jun-2014 16-June-2014 0 24 7 8 16 7 16 78 Volume3Issue6 Volume 3, Issue 6, June 2014 Cloud computing is speculated as the next generation architecture of IT enterprises, providing efficient remote access to massively scalable data storage and application services. While this outsourced storage and computing technique can potentially bring great economical savings for data owners and users, its benefits may not be fully realized due to wide concerns of data owners that their private data may be spontaneously exposed or handled by cloud providers. Although end-to-end encryption techniques have been proposed as secure solution for secure cloud data storage, a primary challenge toward building a full-fledged cloud data service remains how to effectively support flexible data utilization services such as search over the data in a privacy-preserving manner. In this paper, we identify the system requirements and challenges toward achieving privacy-assured searchable outsourced cloud data services, usable design and practically efficient search schemes for encrypted cloud storage. We are presenting a general methodology for these using searchable encryption techniques, which allows encrypted data to be searched by users without leaking information about the data itself and userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s request. Enabling public audit ability for cloud storage is of critical importance so that users can use up to a third party auditor (TPA) to check the integrity of outsourced data and can be worry free. To efficiently introduce an effective TPA, the auditing process should bring in no new vulnerabilities towards user data privacy, and help to avoid additional online burden to user. We propose a secure and efficient cloud storage system supporting privacy-preserving public auditing. We will further extend our result to enable the TPA to perform audits for multiple users simultaneously and efficiently.

There is an increasing public demand to develop systems that can guard against different attacks that are attempted by hackers. One security system which falls in to this category is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). These systems can be broadly classified into two major categories depending on the analysis techniques of IDS these are mainly 1) the anomaly detection and the 2) misuse detection. Therefore our motivation in this research work is to focus on misuse detection; In these types of techniques generally attack signatures are collected and stored in a database in the same way as virus protection software does in order to detect the related attacks. Therefore we put forward a new algorithm that will utilize the known signatures, and use the same to detect related attacks quickly. Published

In this paper we are analyzed various mechanisms to ensure reliable data storage using cloud services. It mainly focuses on the way of providing computing resources in form of service rather than a product and utilities are provided to users over internet. In the cloud, application and services move to centralized huge data center and services and management of this data may not be trustworthy  into cloud environment the computing resources are under control of service provider and the third-party-auditor ensures the data integrity over out sourced data. Third-party-auditor not only read but also may be change the data. Therefore a mechanism should be provided to solve the problem. We examine the problem contradiction between client and CSP, new potential security scheme used to solve problem. The purpose of this paper is to bring greater clarity landscape about cloud data security and their solution at user level using encryption algorithms which ensure the data owner and client that their data will be secured.

This thesis consist of membership function and linguistic variables there may be a number of graph which shows membership function  they also denote criteria and with the help we can calculate our desire result. There are several processes to making or developing as computer software. These processes are often called (SDLC) System Development Life Cycle. There are many working and well-known SDLC models are waterfall model, iterative waterfall model spiral model prototype model etc. They have their own pros and cons. These SDLC models have many phases or stages. We always just reply yes or no for any question. But when I ask how much beautiful you are, then it is difficult to justify among them. Then fuzzy comes. Fuzzy gives flexibility in solution and problem. There are infinite values between o and 1 or true and false yes or no. In SDLC the first stages is feasibility analysis. With the application of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. In my thesis I try to solve some rigid problem which occurs during software development. The above stages of SDLC are rigid property. By the help of linguistic variables I try to solve those problem which are rigid means cost, time period etc.. Throughout in this thesis I used fuzzy methodology to remove rigid behavior of factor affecting feasibility analysis or study. In all many cases feasibility study is rigid state the answer will be yes it is feasible or not.  Then what my thesis do? It gives opportunity to manage different component of feasibility and there effect on it. All above are the parts of software engineering

Also the Voltage profile at different nodes in the power system is affected greatly by the variations in load and generation profiles during normal and abnormal operating states. The reactive power control devices such as generators, tap positions of on-load tap changer of transformers, shunt reactors are used to correct voltage limits violations while simultaneously reducing the system real power losses. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are well-known global search techniques anchored on the mechanisms of natural selection and genetics. Hear i present the work on genetic algorithm for reactive power optimization and voltage control. The objective of genetic algorithm base reactive power optimization is minimizing active power losses while maintaining the quality of voltages.

If the watermarked image is copied, then the information also is carried in the copy. Many Image watermarking techniques have been proposed. In this paper, we review the various methods, the way they express the watermark and their comparison. This paper investigates the field of image watermarking. This includes a general description of the usage of watermarking and the fundamentals for the different approaches that can be taken when using watermarking.

It is more clear that most of the people do not have a wish to discriminated based on their race, nationality, religion, age and so on. This problem mainly arises when these kind of attributes are used for decision making purpose such as giving them a job and loan. For this reason discovering such attributes and eliminating them from the training data without affecting their decision-making utility is essential. So we introduce an antidiscrimination techniques which including discrimination discovery and prevention. Discrimination is two types. Direct ,indirect. Direct discrimination is occurs when decision making is based upon some sensitive  attributes. Indirect discrimination is occurs when decision making is based upon non sensitive attributes which are correlated with sensitive attributes. Discrimination prevention is mainly used for the purpose of inducing patterns that do not lead to discriminatory decisions even if the original training datasets contain any of the discriminatory attributes. In the discrimination prevention method, we introduce a group of pre-processing discrimination prevention methods and specify the different features of each approach and how these approaches deal with direct or indirect discrimination.

IDEA is one of them. The block cipher IDEA operates with 64-bit plaintext and cipher text blocks and is controlled by a 128-bit key. The fundamental innovation in the design of this algorithm is the use of operations from three different algebraic groups. The algorithm structure has been chosen such that, with the exception that different key sub-blocks are used, the encryption process is identical to the decryption process. The drawback of IDEA is that the large numbers of weak keys were found in IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm). Also a new attack on round 6 of IDEA has been detected. This paper describes the design and implementation of international data encryption algorithm (IDEA) protocol, it operates on 64 bit plaintext and also the size of the key has been increased from 128 bits to 256 bits. This increased key size will increase the complexity of the algorithm. To increase the amount of diffusion two MA blocks (multiplicative additive block) are used in a single round of IDEA as compared to one MA block used previously in a single round also use the 12 rounds instead of 8 rounds. With these modifications in the proposed algorithm will increase the cryptographic strength. Published

Most methods are complicated and do not consider the stator flux linkage control, therefore, possible high-speed operations are not feasible. In this study, a novel and simple approach to achieve a low-frequency torque ripple-free direct torque control (DTC) with maximum efficiency based on dq reference frame is presented. This method does not require pulse width modulation and proportional plus integral regulators and also permits the regulation of varying signals. Furthermore, to eliminate the low-frequency torque oscillations,   two actual and easily available line-to-line back EMF constants (kba and kca) according to electrical rotor position are obtained offline and converted to the dq frame equivalents using the new line-to-line park transformation. Then, they are set up in the look-up table for torque estimation. The validity applications of the proposed sensor less three-phase conduction DTC with SVPWM_Hysteresis Controller of BLDC motor drive scheme are verified through simulations results.

This paper presents a fuzzy tuned PID controller based shunt active filter to diminish the harmonics caused by non linear loads like thyristor bridge rectifiers and imbalanced loads. Here Fuzzy controller provides the tuning of PID, based on firing of thyristor bridge rectifiers and variations in input rms current. The shunt APF system is implemented with three phase current controlled Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) and is connected at the point of common coupling for compensating the current harmonics by injecting equal but opposite filter currents.  These  controllers  are  capable  of controlling dc-side capacitor voltage and estimating reference currents. Hysteresis Current Controller (HCC) is used to generate switching signals for the voltage source inverter. Simulation studies are carried out with non linear loads like thyristor bridge rectifier  along  with  unbalanced  loads  and  the results proved that the APF along with fuzzy tuned PID controller work flawlessly for different firing angles of non linear load.

Virtualization can be applied very broadly to just about everything imagine Include memory, networks, storage hardware, operating system. Computing infrastructure provisioning in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud is done in the form of virtual machines. A load balancer which calculates the load on individual virtual server can be used as a base criteria for determining idle machine. By shifting this kind of unused machines to the required end-users we can save the energy and also give advantage of dynamic resource allocation to the cloud users. Hence, we are proposing the system that uses collection of Virtual Machines (VMs) running on unused computers at the edge and uses virtualization technology to allocate resources dynamically based on application demands. We are trying to implement an inventory management system i.e. Master Server which list all connected (available) client machines and handles the request comes from end user, Master also gives respective client machine access to the end user with its load balancing and failure management. There are three main issues discussed in this paper (I) Ã¢â‚¬Å“Resource monitoring and connection establishmentÃ¢â‚¬Â (II) Ã¢â‚¬Å“Inventory management systemÃ¢â‚¬Â i.e. finding efficient virtual machine and allocating them. (III) Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reallocation of the Virtual MachinesÃ¢â‚¬Â i.e. reconfiguring the Virtual Machines when cloud provider is not available with the required Virtual Machines. This paper analyzes the problem from the perspective of an end-users like small and middle organization needs that uses a cloud infrastructure to achieve scalable provisioning of its services in the respect of QoS constraints.

It comes under the assumption that if the feature is visible, the point of attack is evident, thus the all time goal is to conceal the very existence of the embedded data. Many techniques have been suggested to hide data but security is one of the major challenges. In the proposed method this issue has been addressed using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and neural network. Using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), input image is divided into blocks and is processed to generate quantization matrix of cover and stego images. The neural network is trained using LSB bit value. On the basis of training and segmentation done, neural network provide efficient positions where data can be merge. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach gives better PSNR and MSE value. Published

A key challenge faced by data-intensive WSNs is to transmit all the data generated within an applicationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifetime to the base station despite the fact that sensor nodes have limited power supplies. We propose using low-cost disposable mobile relays to reduce the energy consumption of data-intensive WSNs. Our approach differs from previous work in two main aspects. First, it does not require complex motion planning of mobile nodes, so it can be implemented on a number of low-cost mobile sensor platforms. Second, we integrate the energy consumption due to both mobility and wireless transmissions into a holistic optimization framework. Our framework consists of three main algorithms. The first algorithm computes an optimal routing tree assuming no nodes can move. The second algorithm improves the topology of the routing tree by greedily adding new nodes exploiting mobility of the newly added nodes. The third algorithm improves the routing tree by relocating its nodes without changing its topology. This iterative algorithm converges on the optimal position for each node given the constraint that the routing tree topology does not change. We present efficient distributed implementations for each algorithm that require only limited, localized synchronization. Because we do not necessarily compute an optimal topology, our final routing tree is not necessarily optimal.

There are many methods to verify personality or validate anyone. This field is started right from the use of some things and further advanced to use of biometric techniques that are based on structural and behavioral characteristics of humans. The use of such techniques is the most accepted method nowadays. However due to further advances these techniques are now being invaded by thefts or criminals.
Now these biometric techniques can be fully replaced by the new biometric techniques with the advancement of the thermal cameras. The thermal cameras based on IR imaging technique covers some most important drawbacks of conventional cameras. This camera can be used as a sensor for capturing the human vein patterns that are having higher temperature than body and which are variable from person to person.

During welding metal is heated above melting point and cooled at very high speed. So contraction forces are developed in weld joint and HAZ. The microstructure of weld joint is also different in various zones of weld joint. Production of hard and brittle microstructure like martensite, high carbon and other alloying elements present in parent metal, restraint in welding and diffused hydrogen develop the hydrogen induced crack in various areas of weld metal and HAZ. HIC cracks are generally sub surface and difficult to detect but sometimes it propelled towards the surface also. HIC crack is observed both in weld metal and HAZ.  Effect of preheating on cooling rate and alloying elements on development of HIC in low alloy steel and stainless steel metal welding is reviewed in this paper. It was found that by applying preheating, cooling rate of weld metal is reduced and solidification time is increased. Cold cracking can be reduced by selecting proper preheating temperature which depends on carbon equivalent, diffusive content of hydrogen, weld heat input, joint restraint, yield strength of weld metal and thickness of parent metal.

Side information is used in various Text Mining applications such as user-access behavior from web logs, document origin information, other non-textual attributes which are embedded into the text or the links in the document. These could play a significant role for clustering process. However, some of the information may contain noisy data which may lead in increase in the level of difficulty for estimation of importance of side information. 
In such condition it is risky to use the side information in mining process because it may result in the improvement of mining process or may add noise to the process. Therefore to maximize the benefit of using side information in mining text data,we need a principled way to perform the mining process.

The influence of various parameters such as pH (2 to 10), biomass weight (0.5 to 3.0 g/L), initial metal ion concentration (2 to10 ppm/L) and contact time (30 to 150 minutes) on biosorption efficiencies were determined.  Results indicated that the optimum pH was 6 for the removal of Arsenic by U.  fasciata and S.  wighti,  while it was greater than 6 for G. corticata. The maximum removal of arsenic was 90.2% at biomass weight of 2g/100ml for S. wightii and G. corticata. The optimum arsenic (As) adsorption percentage was obtained at 90 minutes of contact time for initial metal ion concentration in all the three macroalgae biomass. The biosorption isotherms studies indicated that the biosorption of Arsenic follows the Langmuir and Freundlich models. The maximum biosorption capacity, q max, was 2.21mmol/g in G. corticata. The Freundlich Arsenic adsorption capacity was in the order of U. fasciata < S. wightii < G. corticata, which also suggested about the coexistence of the monolayer adsorption as well as heterogeneous surface conditions.  The FTIR analysis for surface functional groups of unloaded algal biomass and arsenic loaded biomass revealed that the existence of amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl and carbonyl groups on the surface of biomass cells and the possible interaction between metal and functional groups. SEM micrograph of pretreated and Arsenic sorbed algal biomass showed morphological changes due to the exposure of heavy metal to the algae. These results led to refer that the macroalgal biomass could form a potential, eco-friendly, cost effective and safe alternative biosorbent for fine tuning of waste water treatment. Published

It is difficult for them to interpret users search intention only by query keywords and this leads to ambiguous and noisy search results which are far from satisfactory. It is important to use visual information in order to solve the ambiguity in text-based image retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel Internet image search approach. It only requires the user to click on one query image with minimum effort. Based on both visual and textual content images from a pool are retrieved. In this paper, a system is designed for performing image retrieval in image-rich information networks. In this paper, minimum order k-SimRank to significantly improve the speed of SimRank, one of the most popular algorithms is proposed for computing node similarity in information networks. Published

If noise is included in the channel, data that is received at the receiver side will not be the actual data. This may create a corruption of data which is intolerable. In such situations, an error control must be employed so that errors may be detected and afterwards corrected. In this paper, (15,7,2) BCH encoder and decoder are designed mathematically. The block length(n), data length(k) and maximum number of correctable errors(t) are 15, 7 and 2 respectively. The encoding and decoding operates over the Galois Field GF (24) with an irreducible polynomial x4+x+1. Decoder includes 3 major steps: 1) Syndrome calculation (SC) 2) Berlekamp Massey Algorithm (BMA) 3) Chein Search (CS). The error is then corrected effectively in decoder part with the help of NAND Flash memory.

Logic gate designs unique to relays can be achieved by taking advantage of the electrostatic force dependence on the actuation electrode area [6], [7].  For example, by carefully designing the beam dimensions, the number of driving input electrodes required to actuate a relay can be adjusted to implement two-input AND, OR [7], and NAND [6] gates.  This design technique can be extended to other types of logic gates.  This concept can be applied to the relay design in this paper.  The fixed electrode (used as gate) can be subdivided into multiple separate electrodes that can be independently biased.  This way, the strength of electrostatic force (therefore actuation) can be controlled by the number of input electrodes (gate) that are driven.

The future clientele devices will be completely equipped with multiple networks and to achieve seamlessness there is a need to switch between these networks. Depending on the environment and the availability of network interfaces on the mobile device, it is always better to prefer the network interface best suited for communication [1][2]. As per the current state of technology, for discovering the coverage area of the network, any mobile device would completely rely on RSSI and link quality of network for deciding to trigger for a handoff to the discovered network. Therefore, in environments that have very high user mobility and smaller network coverage area, there could be unnecessary triggering of handoffs. Moreover the handoff across heterogeneous networks has some significant delay and by the time the handoff process has finished the user could already be out of the coverage area.  In order to address this need we added intelligence into our approach by proposing an algorithm which takes decision on handoff triggers based on user location information (location, speed and direction). This allows our proposed approach to prevent the performance degradation and wastage of resources due to unnecessary triggering of handoffs.

In this project synthesis of silver nanoparticles is done using a bottom-up approach. Using a bottom-up approach gives the opportunity to produce silver nanoparticles between 15 and 40 nm. Bottom-up also gives the advantage of producing stable silver nanoparticles compared to silver nanoparticles produced with a top-down approach, because the nanoparticles are placed in defined crystalline structures. The stability of the nanoparticles is important when their properties are to be examined and exploited. The overall results from the absorbance spectroscopy clearly show that to obtain nanoparticles in small sizes and homogenous shapes it is preferable to use the low concentration of silver nitrate. High concentrations of silver nitrate cause a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Analysis of the AFM results yielded particles of average size of 37 nm in width and 18 nm in height.

In todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life providing security has become more cumbersome because of all the malicious possibilities in data transmission, so
we need a system which makes data transmission more secure beyond encryption, passwords and digital signatures. The system
that we are discussing in this report is an Intrusion Detection System, which is a platform that provides security in the
distributed environment.
This paper also attempts to explain the drawbacks in conventional system designs, which may result in low performance and less
data efficiency due to network congestion. The cloud and grid computing systems are considered to improve the efficiency and
performance of the system. Cloud systems are characterized by a main server and other connected servers which provide certain
services. Cloud systems, especially public cloud systems are prone to intrusions and care must be taken to secure the system. The
emphasis in this report is to make grid and cloud systems more secure by implementing intrusion detection system along with
auditing.

Cloud Computing is used to avail internet based services on a lease basis in a very short time period. Purchase and installation of
new computing resources takes time, so getting resources as a service from cloud in a minute or so is faster and cheaper
nowadays. A contract called service level agreement is worked between cloud host and consumer. SLA includes quality of service
(QoS) that must be provided by the cloud host to consumer. It also includes time frame, in that time period consumersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ task should
get done. Due to multi-tenancy architecture a cloud host has many consumers at same time. Some consumers cannot get their job
done in time limit. When rejecting consumersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ leases, deadline plays an important role. This paper introduces mEDF (Modified
Earliest Deadline First) algorithm and leasing policy for deadline driven resource management, which takes care of minimum
capacity expenses at cloud host side. Experiments and results show that this algorithm is suitable and can be used for deadline
driven scheduling with minimizing response time and completion time.

Ever since the rising era of internet technology, network security has become one of the most important issues that needs focus
today. There is an increasing public demand to develop systems that can guard against different attacks that are attempted by
hackers. One security system which falls in to this category is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). These systems can be broadly
classified into two major categories depending on the analysis techniques of IDS these are mainly 1) the anomaly detection and
the 2) misuse detection. Therefore our motivation in this research work is to focus on misuse detection. In these types of
techniques generally attack signatures are collected and stored in a database in the same way as virus protection software does in
order to detect the related attacks In this paper we present an innovative functional framework to evade NIDS. Primary, NIDS are
modeled accurately by means of Genetic Programming (GP). that are looking for evasions on models is simpler than directly
trying to understand the behavior of NIDS. We present a proof of concept showing how to evade a self-built NIDS regarding two
publicly available datasets. Our framework can be used to audit NIDS.

In this paper we proposed a Digital Image Watermarking is the process of embedding information/logo into a digital image which
may be used to verify its authenticity or the identity of its owners. If the watermarked image is copied, then the information also is
carried in the copy. Many Image watermarking techniques have been proposed. In this paper, we review the various methods, the
way they express the watermark and their comparison. This paper investigates the field of image watermarking. This includes a
general description of the usage of watermarking and the fundamentals for the different approaches that can be taken when using
watermarking. With the development in technology, data transfer of secret information plays a major role. We go for data security
in order to prevent the data from hackers and malware infection. In this study, we dealt with the secret key stenography method of
hiding a plaintext in an image using a random key.

Recently the prediction method was introduced for forecasting the web performance by using the innovative application of Turing
Band (TB) geostatistical experiment. However this method is having major limitation which is required to be rectified further. The
forecasting accuracy of this proposed method is poor. In addition to this, this method was only assuming the input data in linear
form to forecast the web performance, however by considering the real time environment, the input data may be vary and nonlinear
as well. Therefore this approach fails for different measurement data as well as prediction horizon lengths. The later
limitation is out of scope of this paper, we are presenting the extended TB method to improve the accuracy of forecasting. We have
studied many methods those are used to improve the forecasting accuracies. The artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the best
methods to improve the forecasting accuracy. In this paper we are presenting the hybrid model of TB and Feed Forward Neural
Network (FFNN) together for improving the overall accuracy performance. The experimental study is performed using the real
time web log dataset and comparative analysis of forecasting accuracy is done in between TB and Hybrid TB method.

In the age of Database technologies a large amount of data is collected and analyzed by using data mining techniques. However,
the main issue in data mining is potential privacy invasion and potential discrimination. One of the techniques used in data
mining for making decision is classification. On the other hand, if the dataset is biased then the discriminatory decision may
occur. Discrimination can be either direct or indirect. Direct discrimination consist of rules procedures that explicitly mention
minority group based on sensitive discriminatory attribute related to group membership. Indirect discrimination consists of rules
or procedures that, while not explicitly mentioning discriminatory attributes, intentionally or unintentionally could generate
discriminatory decisions. Therefore, in this paper we review the recent state of the art approaches for antidiscrimination
techniques and also focuses on discrimination discovery and prevention in data mining. On the other hand, we also study a
theoretical proposal for enhancing the results of the data quality. We discuss how to clean training data sets and outsourced data
sets in such a way that direct discrimination decision rules are converted to legitimate classification rules.

The Tar Sand formation is an oil sand of lower cretaceous age comprised mainly of Bitumen and Heavy oil. Owing to the nature
of these reservoirs, production is often facilitated by the use of thermal recovery processes like electric heating, steam flooding
and most commonly the Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD). In producing from these reservoirs, the variation of the
respective relative permeabilities to distinct fluids is often given major consideration. This work presents the simulation of a
relative permeability model, adapted to a tar sand formation. The results portray the dependence of the fluid saturations and
associated production rates on the governing relative permeability behaviour. The model does not however account for the
heterogeneous nature of the reservoir lending it a few errors.

Traditional statistical techniques are to be extended to handle the high dimensional data during machine learning and prediction
tasks. In many of the applications, the size of data will be exorbitant: from retail marketing data to biomedical images and
natural resource information. For such high-dimensional statistical explorations, Feature selection is essential. As the
dimensionality of data gets increased day by day, there is an essential need to follow new mathematical approaches to deal with
the high dimensional data. Unlike traditional statistical approaches, in machine learning and prediction scenarios, the risk
minimization is considered as a key issue. In view of this, all the mathematical methods in connection with machine learning are
moving around the understanding of the performance of learning theory. In these lines, this paper highlights the dynamics
associated with the collaborative filters which are very much useful in prediction tasks. An effort has been made to analyze the
relationship among the percentage of training samples used, learning rate applied and neighborhood size, especially in supervised
learning environment. Bench mark micro array data set of English Alphabets has been used in the experimental setup.

Nowadays, the use of internet grows, so user wish to store data on cloud computing platform. Most of the time, userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s data are
small files. HDFS designed to process large volume of data. But it cannot handle large number of small files. In this paper, we
have designed improved model for processing small files. In existing system, map tasks processes a block of input at a time. Map
task produces intermediate output which is given to reducer. Reducer gives sort-merge output. Here, multiple map tasks & single
reduce task is used for processing small file. In this approach, if there are large numbers of small files then each map task gets
less input. In this way, performance of HDFS for processing lot of small files has been degraded. In proposed system, small files
efficiently processed by HDFS. HDFS client requested to store small files in HDFS. NameNode permits to store small files in
HDFS. When small files are submitted by HDFS client for processing, NameNode combine files into single split which becomes
an input to map task. Intermediate output produced by map task is given to multiple reducers as an input. Reducer gives sorted
merge output. As the number of map tasks has reduced, the processing time gets decreases.

Encased beam composite construction employs structural members that are composed of two materials: structural steel (rolled
or built-up) and reinforced concrete, is an example of composite members. Encased beams have been used as rigid
reinforcement in deck bridges for several decades. Nowadays they are used mainly in railway reconstruction with limited
building heights. In this paper the effect of the upper steel section flange position of encased beam on the beam capacity and
beam ductility is analyzed. Three-dimensional non-linear finite element analysis adopted by ANSYS till failure is performed on
twenty one simply supported encased concrete beams. For the purpose of validation of the finite element model developed, the
numerical study is carried out on a simply supported concrete beam that was experimentally tested and reported in the
literature; good agreement with the experimental results is observed. Specimens were tested under lateral loading. The test
results indicate that the behavior of the beam is greatly affected by the steel beam upper flange position. Upper flange width the
most important parameter influences the beam capacity and ductility is analyzed, some preliminary criteria for an adequate
design are presented.

Weldability of alloy steel and stainless steel is having major consideration of hydrogen induced cracking or cold cracking.
During welding metal is heated above melting point and cooled at very high speed. So contraction forces are developed in weld
joint and HAZ. The microstructure of weld joint is also different in various zones of weld joint. Production of hard and brittle
microstructure like martensite, high carbon and other alloying elements present in parent metal, restraint in welding and
diffused hydrogen develop the hydrogen induced crack in various areas of weld metal and HAZ. HIC cracks are generally sub
surface and difficult to detect but sometimes it propelled towards the surface also. HIC crack is observed both in weld metal
and HAZ. Effect of preheating on cooling rate and alloying elements on development of HIC in low alloy steel and stainless
steel metal welding is reviewed in this paper. It was found that by applying preheating, cooling rate of weld metal is reduced
and solidification time is increased. Cold cracking can be reduced by selecting proper preheating temperature which depends
on carbon equivalent, diffusive content of hydrogen, weld heat input, joint restraint, yield strength of weld metal and thickness
of parent metal.

Web-scale image search engines (e.g., Google image search, Bing image search) mostly rely on surrounding text
features. It is difficult for them to interpret usersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ search intention only by query keywords and this leads to
ambiguous and noisy search results which are far from satisfactory. It is important to use visual information in
order to solve the ambiguity in text-based image retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel Internet image search
approach. It only requires the user to click on one query image with minimum effort. Based on both visual and
textual content images from a pool are retrieved. In this paper, a system is designed for performing image retrieval
in image-rich information networks. In this paper, minimum order k-SimRank to significantly improve the speed of
SimRank, one of the most popular algorithms is proposed for computing node similarity in information networks.

The Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) has been grown over last few years for the method of transforming information
over a transport system. VANETs are designed as a mobile ad hoc network where every car acts as a single mobile node, the
vehicle nodes communicate without any infrastructure same as in ad hoc network. VANETs are designed to provide road safety
to avoid accidents, traffic monitoring and for other commercial applications. However, efficient routing in these networks
remains a challenging as increasing density of vehicles over a time, size of VANET and natural disturbances like buildings,
trees and signal problem. The major problem in vanet is communication links between vehicles is frequently broken and
Routing becomes a major problem. In such scenarios efficient routing plays a important role. With that efficient routing we
can provide communication in the network even if the density of the vehicles in the network is low. We propose a hop greedy
method to select a routing path with minimum number of intermediate nodes while taking the connectivity into consideration.
We also propose a back bone nodes that helps in providing connectivity status with an intersection. The result shows the high
packet delivery ratio with a shortest route

The heat and airflow characteristics inside a room were investigated numerically and experimentally for their potential
building applications. Constant heat sources at different intensities and locations were considered over a range of Reynolds
numbers 102 Ã¢â€°Â¤ Re Ã¢â€°Â¤104 and a Grashof number of Gr = 106 considering mixed ventilation. The main model considered a single
heat source in the middle of the room with an air supply inflow located in the ceiling. The two-dimensional governing
equations were solved numerically using the finite volume technique under steady state conditions. An experimental set-up was
designed and constructed to study the validity of the main model. A reasonable agreement was found between the theoretical
and experimental results. To support this conclusion, two applications testing four different case studies were considered by
using two different workstation scenarios and different heat source locations. The optimal transitional region ranging between
predominately natural convection to forced convection was investigated. The parameter Gr/Re2 was introduced as a measure of
the strength of the mixed convection. The results showed the isotherm and streamline contours inside the ventilated zone were
affected by the value of the Reynolds number. The first experimental application determined the maximum surface
temperature of the highest heat source intensity occurs at its far side from the air supply. The Reynolds number test values
were found to be independent of the workstation scenario conditions tested, especially at Re > 103. During testing of the second
application, the maximum computer surface temperature was decreased with an increase in the Reynolds number.

(LPG) cylinder. LPG is a color less liquid which readily evaporates into a gas. A mixer of air, the gas can burn or explode when
it meets a source of ignition. Composite materials are macroscopic combinations of two or more distinct materials having a
discrete and recognizable interface separating them. Composites are heterogeneous materials. The weight savings are also
presented for steel, Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) composites LPG cylinders. LPG cylinder is reduced by replacing
conventional metal by GFRP material.
Keywords: GFRP, LPG Cylinder, Solid Modeling.

Dried biomass of three seaweeds namely Ulvafasciata, Sargassumwightii and Gracilariacorticata were treated with or without
heavy metal Chromium (VI) at 100 ppm concentration. These samples were subjected to Fourier Transform Infrared Spectral
(FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) analysis. The FTIR analysis for surface functional groups of pretreated
seaweed biomass revealed the presence of Ã¢â‚¬â€œOH, -NH, C-O, C-O-S, CH2,CH3C-O-S and ether sulphate C6 linkvibrations were
significantly increased or decreased in wave number or missed from the band in Cr(VI) treated samples. It was due to the
predominant interaction of that functional groups with the heavy metal, Cr (VI). Similarly the SEM micrograph of pretreated
and Cr (VI) treated biomass showed some morphological differences. These results led to conclude that seaweed biomass could
be used as biosorbent to remove heavy metals from waste water and industrial effluents.
Keywords:Seaweed biomass, FTIR, SEM micrographs, functional groups, biosorbent.

A Sensor network is a technique where many distributed sensor devices with a sensing system collect information. These nodes
are normally deployed in an adhoc manner, operate in distributed way. Generally the sensors nodes are battery powered, and it
is often not feasible recharge them. This makes the problem of conserving energy at individual sensor nodes challenging. This
paper introduces S-MAC protocol used for WSNs and proposes SEE-MAC, a Medium-Access Control protocol designed for
Wireless Sensor Networks. SEE-MAC uses a little advanced technique to reduce energy consumption. A new protocol is
proposed to improve the energy efficiency, latency and throughput for WSNs. A modification of the protocol is proposed to
reduce the need for some nodes to live awake longer than the other nodes which improves the energy efficiency, latency and
throughput and therefore increase the life period of a wireless sensor network.
Keywords:-Medium Access Control, Wireless Sensor Network, Energy Efficiency, Latency, Throughput.
1019 2021 IJAIEM-2016-11-29-30 Efficient Load Balancing Techniques for Cloud Computing Omkumari Soni,  Shalini Khare, Rama  Soni Dr.Bheem Rao Ambedkar Polytechnic,Gwalior(M.P.) sonirajni.soni@gmail.com Volume5Issue11 http://www.ijaiem.org/Volume5Issue11/IJAIEM-2016-11-29-30.pdf 112-119 INR 2500 Volume 5, Issue 11, November 2016 Abstract
Cloud computing mean is storing and accessing data and programs over the internet instead of computers hard drive. The
cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet. A cloud consists of several elements such as clients, data centre and distributed
servers and also includes fault tolerance, high availability, scalability, flexibility, reduced overhead for users, reduced cost of
ownership, and on demand services etc. Central to these issues lays the establishment of an effective load balancing algorithm.
Load balancing ensures that all the processor in the system or every node in the network does nearly equal amount of work at
any instant of time. This technique can be sender initiated, receiver initiated or symmetric. In this paper we developed an
effective load balancing algorithm using load scheduling theorem with different parameters for the clouds of different sizes for
higher performance.
Keywords: Cloud Computing, Load Balancing, Load Scheduling Theorem

Professor, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, ATME College of Engineering, Mysuru, Karnataka, India biregowda7@gmail.com Volume5Issue11 http://www.ijaiem.org/Volume5Issue11/IJAIEM-2016-11-18-15.pdf 120-131 INR 2500 Volume 5, Issue 11, November 2016 ABSTRACT
This study comprises of composite materials required for elevated temperatures for hardness property and at room temperature
applications for other mechanical properties fabricated using hot air oven. Epoxy resin was used as matrix and glass fiber is
used as reinforcement. Fillers like Al2O3, SiC, activated carbon powder and BaSO4 are the fillers used to bring in elevated
temperature resistance for hardness and high mechanical strengths at room temperature. These composites are subjected to
mechanical tests like wear, impact, tensile and hardness tests. Tensile, wear and impact energy were improved with variations
in filler contents. Wear resistance also improved with increase in filler content SEM micrographs are used to explain the
microstructure.
Keywords: Temperature resistance, EGRH, Activated Carbon, Al2O3, SiC, BaSO4, Hardness
