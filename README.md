## Sib Panel 8.0

The likelihood of this being backdoored is like, almost certain. I removed one and kept at least one. Go find it. I'm not here to give production-ready malware but rather think of this as a museum.

Crontabs and install instructions are in other SIB repos scattered on my page. DB schema also is the same and can be found in my repos.
